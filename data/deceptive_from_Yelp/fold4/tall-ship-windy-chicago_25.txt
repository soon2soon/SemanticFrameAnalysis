Arrrrrgh, Tall Ship Windy,  Blows. Payed for expensive parking at Navy Pier, only to find unannounced black out  dates for a Groupon I was attempting to use.  The box office was unapologetic about not accepting the certificate and explained that they were doubling prices for the weekend because there was a tall ship event.  Took my crying toddler home, got a refund from groupon and promised to never return to this slipshod operation.  Not fun. Not worth it.
