We did the "Lincoln Park" Tour.  We were really excited and were stumped on one clue, which set the tone for the rest of the tour.  Also, we responded 20 feet for one of our answers... and we got the question wrong because we included the word feet! Otherwise, we enjoyed the little tid-bits of information and really loved the residential area that we had to walk through.  The little shops were great too! all in all, we had a lot of fun and I would do it again in the city where I live!
