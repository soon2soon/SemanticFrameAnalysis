I got to stay here for a conference and I didn't want to leave. We had a view of the river and the Chicago Theater sign. The red line was a block away. The room was clean, and spacious enough. The lobby wasn't exactly cozy, but it was stylish. The best part was the starbucks/cafe in the lobby and the access to a business center which included a fedex, Asian hot bun shop, and a few others.
