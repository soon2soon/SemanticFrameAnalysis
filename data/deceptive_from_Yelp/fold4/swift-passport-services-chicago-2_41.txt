After procrastination for weeks about renewing  and upgrading my passport card to a passport book, I finally took the time to call a few places in order to get my passport expedited. I originally called Swift and was given specific instructions as to what needed to be done. But decided to head over to the State passport offices thinking things would be more reliable being as though the state is a direct service. After arguing with some less than smart person for ten minutes I again gave up on the state and walked out feeling like I didn't want to take my Caribbean getaway. I decided to follow the steps and hand deliver the required info directly to the good people at Swift and in doing so was more than happy with their  customer service and was delighted to give them extra to get my passport ... Surprisingly, I got a call less than 24 hrs later informing me my passport had arrived... I thought it was a mistake so I called the following morning and behold... Passport available....!!!. Nothing makes you feel more like an american than having a passport so you can leave...lol Thanks to SWIFT... I can leave sooner!
