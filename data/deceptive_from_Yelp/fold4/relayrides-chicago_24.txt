I have had an ok experience with the service. The one downside is that they don't have a phone number you can call into - the only way of communication is via email. As a result, responses can be very slow. I was told that my security deposit was returned more than a week ago, only to find out today after inquiring with customer service again that it was never released. Now I will need to wait another week for the refund to hopefully come back. In the meantime, I have to pay off the balance on my credit card because they billed the security deposit back when I rented the car (3 weeks ago).
