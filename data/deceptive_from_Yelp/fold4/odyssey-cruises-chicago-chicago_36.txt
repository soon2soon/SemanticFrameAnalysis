We received a cruise package for the Odyssey in Chicago for the Friday of Valentine's Day weekend 2012.  We got to the ship at 6:45 and sat down.  Overall the interior of our deck was nice ad our waiter was nice but that was the extent of what was in fact acceptable.  It was a very windy night and we were told we might not set sail however we ended up pulling out of port around 7:45pm.  The bay was EXTREMELY wavy and the boat was very rocky.  Many people were getting sick and we asked the staff if we could finish our cruise in port.  They did go back to port early but not until 10:10pm.  By this time many people were sick.  I went into the bathroom and there was vomit in both toliets and a man was actually vomitting in one of the sinks while I was in the bathroom.  Around 8:10pm we asked our waiter, guest manager and a ship attendee if we could go back and they did not do anything.  The food looked good however I could not really eat since I was feeling sea sick.  Also, the band was awful, unless you like cheesy 70's lounge acts.  Their singing was off key and they keyboard player kept missing notes.  We were also told there would be a moie being shown upstairs and were told it was Sleepless in Seattle.  Really, this movie is almost 20 years old!!  There are lots of things to experience when you go downtown CHicago so save your money and spend it on something else!!
