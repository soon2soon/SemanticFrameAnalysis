We decided to do something different while in Chicago and decided to go on a food tour, after looking into several different companies, we chose the Tastebud Tours Taste of Chicago. As a group of 7, it was difficult to get a block of tickets together but after talking to Lynn on the phone, he was able to set up a new tour for us. On the day of the tour, we started with deep dish pizza, had a Chicago style hot dog, cupcakes, chocolate and a lot of other delicious food. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and shared a lot of the history behind, not only the food that we were enjoying, but also the history behind some of the landmarks we passed on the way though the city. Be prepared to eat A LOT and walk though the city, it rained while on our tour but it was still the best experience that we had our whole trip!
