Lobby bar is great.  Decor, especially in common areas, is cool.  Beds are suuuuuuuuper comfy...feather bed type under cushion.  Gym is clean and decent....although pretty small...good enough for a quick workout.  Some views, depending on the side of the building, can be great.  Service is courteous, although I would say they are used to constant good tips for everything they do.  Great location.  Ridiculous prices for room service and mini bar...but you probably guessed that.
