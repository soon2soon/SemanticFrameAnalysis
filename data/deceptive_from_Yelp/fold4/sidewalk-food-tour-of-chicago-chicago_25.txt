Went on the River North tour and loved it. Alyssa was our tour guide and she was great. She was engaging, fun, and nice. Went with a friend who just moved here to show off the city to her (I live in Chicago), and I was surprised at how much I learned! Alyssa taught us about the food and restaurants, but also about Chicago architecture and history. When I heard we were going to get samples, I thought it wouldn't be very much food--but I was wrong. We got a ton of food! We got really ample portions at every restaurant we ate at. I was definitely full after, plus the Doughnut Vault had what is definitively the best donut I have ever eaten. And it was incredible that we didn't have to wait on line! I definitely recommend this tour (with Alyssa if possible!) for both Chicagoans and visitors.
