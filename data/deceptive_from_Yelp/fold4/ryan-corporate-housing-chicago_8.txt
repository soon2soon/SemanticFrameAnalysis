This was our 9th year of renting a corporate furnished apartment; and thanks to Ryan Corporate Housing, it was our easiest and most enjoyable! From inquiring about the apartments to rent, to checking in, to our actual 2 month stay at Streeter Place, we could not have had a more pleasant experience!!! After reading all of the previous reviews, I can honestly say that we agreed with all of the reviewers. If you are looking for a corporate furnished apartment in Chicago, Ryan Corporate Housing should be your first choice.
