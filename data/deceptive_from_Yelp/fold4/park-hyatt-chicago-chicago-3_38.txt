This is without a doubt one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. One step inside and it's easy to see why this is the Hyatt corporation's flagship property. Almost everything is designer - right down to the plumbing fixtures (which are imported from Europe.) The "glassware" in the rooms is actually German crystal (Zwiesel brand.) The bathrooms are the best I've seen in any hotel featuring a large soaking tub, a walk-in glass and marble shower with two shower heads, an LCD TV in full view of the tub, and a granite/marble chip double bowl vanity. All toiletries are Davies Gate brand. I recommend taking advantage of the hotel's courtesy car (a black BMW 745Li.) They will drop you off anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel for free. The driver told me they may be looking at leasing a new Audi A8 in the future. The room furnishings are out of this world. If the bed weren't so comfortable, I could have easily slept in the Herman Miller Eames chair/ottoman. At the glass desk is a BRNO chair, designed by Mies van der Rohe. I cannot say enough positive things about the staff...everyone acts as if you are the only guest. Even the ice bucket is replenished with the twice daily turndown services. Really, the PH doesn't even feel like a hotel...more like your own urban sanctuary. The only "problem" Â I experienced during the entire stay was with the in-room safe. It would not recognize the code I programmed in, so I called the front desk. Within 5 minutes, a staff member came upstairs and plugged in a palm pilot, reset something, and the problem was solved. About an hour or two later, I heard a knock at the door...it was a butler who brought a slab of chocolate in a gift box along with a personally addressed, hand-written letter basically thanking me for choosing the hotel. What a nice touch! It is indeed expensive, but this establishment is definitely a case of, "you get what you pay for."
