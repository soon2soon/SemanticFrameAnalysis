I've been to this hotel many times for work, for weddings, for play - and every time I adore it. It's a palatable modern, clean in design, yet simply lavish. I love the feel of this place and it's location. The rooms are nicely sized and immaculately clean and bright. They also have a great cocktail that has blackberries in it that I loved the last time I was there. Yum!
