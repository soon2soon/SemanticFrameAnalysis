We used Second City trolley for my mother-in law birthday transportation needs. We had to transport about 35 people 65 and older to the birthday destinantion. Trolley came right on time, so our group did not even have a chance to start worrying; ride was smooth, driver was very courteous and accomodating to some of the challenging mobilities of our guests. Pick up and drive back was as wonderful, too, and it felt like a summer camp bus Â - people were singing and even attempted to dance! Everybody enjoyed the ride. Thank you for wonderful service!
