Great location, courteous and professional service, easy check-in and check-out, beautiful rooms and bathrooms - I surely will stay here again. We stayed here in the last week of Nov, 2013 for a few days for our wedding night. They gave us free upgrade and congratulated us with a big smile for our special day. Room came with a living room and nice bathroom.
