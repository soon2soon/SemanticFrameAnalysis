RelayRides is a wonderful service for someone like myself who wants the flexibility of an automobile without the hassle and expense of owning and maintaining a car. I am a big fan of public transit (I use the CTA in Chicago), but sometimes a big grocery trip or a trip out of the city is just not doable without 4 wheels and a trunk! At least in Chicago, the density of RelayRides owners in my neighborhood ensures healthy competition and keeps the rental prices very low. I have used RelayRides about 5-6 times in the past year, mostly for local trips but once for a 300 mile round trip to Wisconsin for camping, and every owner I have interacted with has been a pleasure to work with. Overall I think RelayRides offers an innovative service that with the proper population density can really offer a cheap, reliable alternative to owning a car. I plan on continuing to use this service in the future and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone else looking for the occasional car rental.
