Stay here if you're visiting Chicago! We came for our honeymoon and were greeted before even going in with smiles from the doormen who took care of our luggage followed by a very respectful, helpful young woman at the desk who provided us with a map that showed the walking distance to such city attractions as Willis (Sears) Tower, Navy Pier, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain, Millennium Park (The Bean), Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Hancock Observatory. We had such a good time we even extended our stay for a total of 5 nights! The whirlpool and indoor pool were awesome plus they provided delicious water with different fruits in it everyday. Overall it was a wonderful location with outstanding service!
