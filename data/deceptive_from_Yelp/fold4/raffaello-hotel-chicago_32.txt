I booked this hotel for 2 nights. My grandson had surgery and ended up staying an extra night.  They booked me through expedia for $119.00  plus tax.for a third night.  The beds were awesome, very comfortable.  The room was very very cold, we tried to turn it up and it still was just as cold, almost as if there was no heat.  The shower unit didn't have a full door, only a piece of glass for half of the shower unit. Our overall stay was very very good. I would recommend this hotel to anybody!! Very clean hotel, and the staff were very friendly.
