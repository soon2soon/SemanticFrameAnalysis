On Sat Aug. 21 I bought tickets for the evening Pirate cruise for my 16 yr old daughter, her friend, my sister and myself. We had a BOGO offer from the Chicago This Week magazine. I have been on other lake cruises and architectural cruises in Chicago with other companies and this one was just as good, if not better. If you are taking smaller children, sit in the middle of the ship and listen to the pirate tales or help raise the sails. If you have older children, or Â no children and want to relax and take in the view, sit aft (see I learned something!) and get some beautiful pictures of the sails and the Chicago skyline/coastline. The crew was wonderful, personable and willing to pose for silly touristy pictures. Thanks T for the great conversation and rum and coke. If you are going on the weekend and doing the fireworks cruise, you may want to call ahead and make reservations over the phone. I think they book up pretty quickly. Thanks for a great experience and good luck to all of you!
