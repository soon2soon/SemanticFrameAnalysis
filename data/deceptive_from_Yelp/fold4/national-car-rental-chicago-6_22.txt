Pretty bad customer service. I'm Executive member and always go to National for my rental needs but this time it was anything but good. While the car selection in the Exec aisle was pretty good , The lady at the checkout counter was pretty nasty to say the least. I had made a reservation for 4/2 and cancelled it as my plans changed a bit ( received cancellation email from National regarding this. Rate for the rental period was 113$ for 4 nights ). I then went ahead made another reservation and added a coupon which brought the price down to 96.xx$ . On the day of the pick , I received an email from National stating that reservation has been confirmed but when I went to checkout , the price for some reason was showing as 133$! it took me almost 75min to get this issue resolved. Beware of renting from National at MDW location and if at all you have no other option , be ready for some nasty treatment at the checkout counter !
