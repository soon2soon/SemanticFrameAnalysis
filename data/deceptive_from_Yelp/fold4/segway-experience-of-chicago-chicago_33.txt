I wanted to treat my husband to a Chicago weekend, so we rode Amtrak into Chicago on the Fourth of July.  Great city and absolutely loved exploring Lakeshore Drive on Friday (5th) on a Segway.  Casey and Ryan were the best hosts/guides and make great ambassadors for a city they obviously love!!  We were the seniors (60+) on the trip but these two made us feel very included in our group.  Must do excursion!!
