Four of us did the Lincoln Park hunt this afternoon. It was great weather for this mostly outdoor activity. My friends and I found it very entertaining and informative. We learned some new information about the Lincoln Park area and had a great walk around the area.  I liked the mix of historical information stops and local business stops.  The local businesses chosen captured our attention and interest.  We spent quite a bit of time in each of those places. I don't think this scavenger hunt would entertain youngsters as much as it did us adults, but I think it was a fun way to see the area and learn a bit more about the area. I'm going to try another hunt from this company in the future.   A couple of the initial "hints" were rather vague, but we soon learned the next target was much closer rather than farther away.  One suggestion is to make sure you include an address for Second City, since out-of-towners might not know where it is located.  Also, it would be helpful to have a "if you get to ______, you've gone too far".  We walked right past one of the targets because we were focused on the pond. I'm betting this review gets put in the "not recommended" pot, since I haven't reviewed much.  Stray Boots deserts a better review than the one disgruntled dad with his 11-year old niece.
