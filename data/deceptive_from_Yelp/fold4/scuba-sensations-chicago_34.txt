We found Rami/Scuba Sensations when looking to get Scuba Certified for our honeymoon.  I can't even begin to explain how great Rami was.  I travel during the week for work and Rami was so flexible and was able to work with our schedule.  After our first class with Rami and explaining why we were learning - he actually reached out to the dive shop where we were staying for our honeymoon.  He wanted to make sure they were reputable and to make sure we had all the information we needed to ensure we had a great dive on the honeymoon.  And this was only after our first session!   Everything after that was great.  He made learning fun.  He was great at explaining everything and really made sure we really understood everything.  I just got certified over the weekend and I can't believe how comforatble I am under the water.  Me and my fiance can't wait for the honeymoon - but we definitly plan to do some dive trips with Scubba Sensations as well!!
