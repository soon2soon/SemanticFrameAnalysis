They do nickel-and-dime, and after paying $10 a day for WiFi, it didn't work. After a day of trying to fix it, they moved us to another room, where it still didn't work. As a business traveler it put me in a frustrating situation. The room was fine, but the hotel is confusing. The lobby isn't really one, the elevators have no buttons inside it, and there are no vending machines. The staff was nice enough, but because of the Wi-Fi issue, it ended up being a frustrating stay.
