I have stayed here on more than one occasion, and just as previous reviewers have said, you won't need to worry about cleaning/disinfecting anything! The entire hotel is SPOTLESS...I haven't even found so much as a water spot in the bathrooms. The rooms are a little on the small side, but that's because the bathroom is so big. The only gripe I have is they charge for WiFi...true, this is Chicago and almost all hotels charge but it just seems that in this day and age, especially in urban areas, free WiFi should be a given. Also, the television sets are a little old...it would be nice to see flat screens in all the rooms. But regardless, you won't go wrong with the Sofitel! Highly recommended.
