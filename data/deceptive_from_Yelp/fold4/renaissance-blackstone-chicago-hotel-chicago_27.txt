What a beautiful hotel! The rooms are comfortable and clean. Very "Barbara Barry" inspired decor. The room service menu is quite tasty and there is a lobby entrance to a Starbucks to charge you up on your way out for your city walk-about. However, the customer service is terrible. The staff was disenchanting, and I am sad to say I would NEVER visit this hotel again.  If you are planning on a stay in the near future I would recommend the following:     When you confirm your booking and are guaranteed certain amenities (i.e. two full sized beds or roll-a-ways), take down the name of the person who confirms the reservation!
