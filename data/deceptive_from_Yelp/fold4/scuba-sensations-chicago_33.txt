All the reviews you've read so far are true, I cant say enough good things about Rami and Scuba Sensations. I met Rami at a local dive spot while I was taking my certification class with a different instructor. After meeting Rami I though I would check out his shop, I went twice. The first time I went Rami was not there but his wife was running the shop. I mentioned I was just looking around. When I left, she was busy with another customer at the time so I simply walked out. She cam running out of the shop to chase me down just to apologize she didnt say good bye to me before I left. I went back again a few days later to buy a dive log binder. Rami remembered meeting me and was happy to see me stop by. I informed him I was looking to buy all my own equipment but not for another couple of weeks. Knowing that, and that I was only there to buy a $20 dive log binder, he still took the time (almost an hour) to show me all the different gear, explain the differences, let me try stuff on, etc. I rarely write reviews on here but this shop was so good, I had to write one to let others know. I'll definitely be going back for my rental equipment this weekend, and then later in a few weeks to buy my own equipment.
