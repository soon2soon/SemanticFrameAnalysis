I used Second City Trolley to drive our wedding party around the north suburbs for pictures after the ceremony, and I truly can't say enough good things about our experience.  From the beginning, Thomas responded to my (many!) e-mail inquiries immediately and was very helpful and friendly.   The prices really are reasonable with other vendors in the area, and they have a large variety of trolleys to choose from which is awesome - you can look at all the pictures on their website so you know exactly what you'll be getting.  It was actually tough to choose because they had so many great options. Our driver, Nick, was superb.  As promised, he called me the day before the wedding to make sure we were all set to go and confirm times and locations so we wouldn't have to worry about it the day of the wedding, which was much appreciated, and he arrived at the ceremony site early to be sure there were no problems.  The trolley was beautiful, and very clean--you can tell Nick really puts a lot of effort into keeping it maintained.  And the A/C worked great!   They say rain on your wedding day is good luck, but people, we had flash floods (literally--storm alerts on the phones and all).  Throughout the entire ordeal, Nick was calm and drove very carefully through what was really a heck of a storm that turned the streets into rivers.  Typical Chicago, you never know what weather you'll get, but he really was terrific and put everybody at ease. I would absolutely use Second City again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anybody else.  Thank you for making that part of my wedding planning as easy as can be!
