I used surreal limo for my friends wedding, best thing i did as the best man.  Everything was pristine and the driver, James, was fun and professional.  The entertainment gear in the bus is top notch and the ride was smooth enough that the ladies were able to dance the entire time we were in it.  Great music and Lighting.  I have already booked another party with them and would highly recommend them
