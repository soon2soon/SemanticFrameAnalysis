Easy and friendly customer service. Manager and teller at the counter were both welcoming and patiently answered our questions concerning our choice of car, tolls, etc. Shuttle buses, both for arrivals and departures, were waiting for passengers and fast. Being an Emerald Member let's you choose your preferred vehicle - and there was a wide range of nice choices. This rating is a four stars bec. we had to find a greeter at the lot and they sort of just leave you to find your own car without any help on the mechanics of the car such as parking brakes, condition of the car (there significant scratches), and leaving the lot was slow- there was a car ahead and one had to explain here at the gate where the dents were instead of at the lot with the greeter. I can highly recommend National Car Rental.
