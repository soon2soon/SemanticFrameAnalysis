My boyfriend and I went here in preparation for a trip to Belize.  They were so thorough and amazing!  The nurse was incredibly knowledgeable.  She had prepared packets of information for each of us (even though we are traveling together) with details on what we needed in terms of medications and vaccinations, what diseases are prevalent in the areas we will be traveling to, etc.  She also went over a lot of details of how to avoid illnesses.  Overall we had a great experience and I can not recommend Passport Health enough!!  I would say the only downside would be that they do not deal with insurance, so you have to file a claim yourself following your vaccinations.
