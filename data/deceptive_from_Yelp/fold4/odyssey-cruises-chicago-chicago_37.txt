Overpriced, overpriced, OVERPRICED!  Horrible service.  Simply not worth the money.  It was myself and my aunts.  We all assembled in Chicago and splurged on what we thought would be a wonderful "spoil me rotten" outing on the Odyssey in Chicago (apparently our waiter didn't get the memo).  We splurged for the "Premium drink package" which wasn't so premium.  First drink we ordered was a Grey Goose and we were told that it wasn't part of our "package".  Secondly, I had upgraded to a window seat...turns out if you are a group of 5 or more  your odds of getting a window seat is almost 100%...don't pay extra...  Felt bad for the couples in which they split the tables up 3 across so you are practically eating on top of your complete stranger neighbor.   Food was okay.  Drink service was incredibly slow, who cares that you paid for a drink package when they serve you as slow as they do. On top of it one of my aunts had a family medical emergency and couldn't make it and of course the ticket was non-refundable.  Upon reviewing the Odyssey with their online survey they offered me a complimentary pair of tickets... nice but technically I paid for one of them, so they were only giving me one at their expense.  After my email reply to them no one has responded back to me...apparently these actually don't care THAT much! The only positive thing I experienced was the live music.  They were excellent. It turns out we could have chartered a private boat for what we spent on our evening aboard the Odyssey.  Apparently $1500.00 wasn't enough.     All in all a complete dissapointment!
