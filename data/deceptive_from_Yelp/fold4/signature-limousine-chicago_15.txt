DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!! NO STARS! Had emailed specific instructions about a pick at airport..they got it completely wrong with wrong # of passengers and wrong airport, told my client that I gave them the wrong information... Good thing I saved my emails! I called her back to see what the mix up was all about...she insisted she never told my client about the wrong information and that I was a crazy person for thinking she could have made a mistake! SHE WAS RUDE & UNPROFESSIONAL & OBVIOUSLY UNORGANIZED!!!! VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN I BOOKED THE CAR FROM CALIFORNIA AND MY CLIENTS WERE GETTING PICKED UP IN CHICAGO...
