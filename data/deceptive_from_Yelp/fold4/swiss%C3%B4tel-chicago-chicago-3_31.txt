Pros: The location of the hotel is excellent and rooms were really clean! Smart elevator service, it takes you one moment to get accustomed but then it works well. Cons: Cleaning staff was really non professional: they woke us up twice by ringing the bell insistently despite the privacy tag on the door. At 9am. Without even apologizing. There's no complementary wifi in the rooms (you have to pay a ridiculous price for it). Parking rates are outrageous. Despite having a clean bathroom water smelled moldy... Overall a nice hotel in a very good spot, but given the 4 stars, I was expecting a significantly better experience. I will probably not stay there again.
