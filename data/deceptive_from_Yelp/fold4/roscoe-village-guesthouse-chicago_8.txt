The Roscoe Village Guesthouse was a great alternative to the hotels and busyness of downtown Chicago, plus the price is more than fair!  The neighborhood is absolutely delightful, with cute shops and restaurants within easy walking distance, yet close enough to public transportation that you can go anywhere from here.  The beds and linens were clean and comfortable.  The space held the two families that were renting it for the weekend, and gave us plenty of room to just hang when we wanted to.  It is such a nice alternative to visiting Chicago to stay at a guesthouse like Roscoe.  The owner, Joe, is more than helpful and really has the hands-on style of an old fashioned innkeeper.  We would definitely go back!
