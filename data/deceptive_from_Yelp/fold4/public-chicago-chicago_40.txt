We stayed here for our quick-trip to Chicago over the weekend and were met with excellent service from start to finish. Arriving extraordinarily late in the evening, we checked in with ease. The staff was more than accommodating and had excellent suggestions for nearby food and sites. The atmosphere of Public was pure perfection. From to moment you walk in the doors you are enveloped in the exquisite design. While grand, it is far from overwhelming. The bar in Pump Room was the perfect spot for an afternoon cocktail before getting ready for dinner. Even after check-out the Public staff continued their hospitality by holding our luggage until our 6:00 PM departure. We had a wonderful stay. Great atmosphere, great beds, great room, exceptional location, and definitely a great place to stay when visiting Chicago.
