I planned a staff lunch aboard the Odyssey.  Everyone, from our sales associate, Tiffany to our servers, were absolutely fantastic.  They were courtesous, considerate, and attentive to our needs.  The food was incredible and the entertainment was delightful.   We could not have asked for anything more.   All this combined with the gift of gorgeous weather from mother nature made for a perfect day.
