We enjoyed our stay. The room was very nice and the location is fantastic. The staff was nice too, though the bellman had no qualms about sharing how busy he was. I pricelined this hotel for $80, so that is part of the 4 stars, it was a value for sure. It is a little shabby at some edges. The two things I noticed were the lounge chairs were quite worn, all the way through at some points. In our room the plate around the door handle on the outside of our bathroom was not screwed in at all (missing 4 screws). Very easy to fix the second one if details are attended to.
