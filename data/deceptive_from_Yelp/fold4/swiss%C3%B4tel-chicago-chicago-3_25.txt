this hotel is very nice but the service sucks well the service in the hotel is nice. I had a great experience with the front desk people BUT.. they charged us $130 for parking for 2 nights after we called and asked how much parking was. The person on the phone told us parking was included. We didn't bother to look for a better option because we didn't think we had to. When I called the day after checking out to inquire about said $130 charge on my card I had to go through 3 different people only for them to tell me that because I couldn't remember who i talked to on the phone that they were not going to refund the money. The person on the phone told us that parking was included. the valet never mentioned a charge and they say that a sign somewhere by the front door constitutes them telling you. They are a bunch of crooks and I will never ever stay there again. i recommend everyone else stays away. Its sad that the hard work the people in the hotel do is undone by the horrible customer service you receive elsewhere. worst hotel ever. I hope you go out of business and I will make it my personal mission to make that happen
