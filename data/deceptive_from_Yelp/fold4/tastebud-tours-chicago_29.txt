My husband and I had the wonderful experience of taking the Taste Chicago tour today with John as our guide. What a fabulous and educational tour! I booked tihs tour based on the reviews on yelp and tripadvisor... and my advice to you dear reader, is sometimes you need to take the bad reviews with a grain of salt... being in sales, you can't always please everyone 100% of the time! That said, John is a great tour guide... he's one of tastebud's first tour guides and yes, he knows his history, plus he has passion for what he does! While the Billy Goat Tavern was not on the tour, he enjoyed telling us the history of this place and we headed there immediately following our tour to buy a tee shirt. :-) Â We are definitely returning to Chicago later this year and will book the Savor Chicago tour and the San Francisco tour (our hometown) too!!
