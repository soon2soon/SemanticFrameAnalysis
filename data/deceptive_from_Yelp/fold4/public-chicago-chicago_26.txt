Looks great on the website, but I found it disappointing overall. Phoenix should have shot the video for 'Trying to be Cool' here.   Service was lacking, staff seemed to just want to go home.  I was given the wrong type of room and was bitten by some sort of bug. Also this hotel is old so get ready for old, noisy air conditioning.
