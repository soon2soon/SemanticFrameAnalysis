Ok I am a hotel snob. I will pay...but I want service. Rooms are very nice. The suites here are amazing. The suite we got had a gorgeous view. Pool is sweet. But it's the staff here. I have stayed here at least five times in the last year and there is always a little something in the service that says " you're here, yes you are a customer, but don't ask me to do too much for you". I am used to to Anything you want, you get it. Not here. Room service takes too long to get to the room. And the burger we had was raw. Yuck. And when we called them to send it back, they were put out. Service at the front desk is a smiling newscaster-type reporting a murder. She tells you what she is supposed to instead of listening. Upgrade? Don't bother me. I already made your key. If this place wants to be better, the staff here needs to go to the Park Hyatt in Toronto. That place KNOWS how to treat a customer.
