It's cozy, comfortable, clean, creative, calm & conscientious ALL rolled into one!  This was SUCH a pleasant and surprising find.  SUCH a great deal/bargain for the price and SUCH a unique and charming place.  Cannot imagine now staying anywhere else in the city!  Also appreciated their eco-friendly approach to things!....
