Very convenient to The Magnificent Mile. A short walk to bus stops & trains. About a 20 minute walk to Millennium Park.  Hotel staff are very friendly & helpful.  We stayed for 5 nights, so they upgraded us to a larger room at no extra cost. A pity there are no self laundry facilities near by when you are staying a few days.  The beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are clean, the rooms modern & comfortable.  The lobby bar & cafe serves a good coffee & yummy breakfast!  I would definitely recommend this hotel.
