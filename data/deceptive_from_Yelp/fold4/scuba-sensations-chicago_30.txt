I went to Scuba Sensations to finish a certification that I previously started in Mexico and due to bad weather I couldn't finish. Rami was great and very flexible with me and helped me complete my certification in time for my trip. Rami and his friends are very accommodating and friendly. I would definitely recommend people to go there and check out.
