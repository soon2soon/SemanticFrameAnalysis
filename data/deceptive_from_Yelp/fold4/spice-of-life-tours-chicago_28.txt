Spice of Life is not just a food tour - though there was more than enough food, and it was all good. You also stop at local stores and a Sikh Temple. The host, Mr. Ali, is very personable and enthusiastic, and knows a lot about the area (he grew up there) and the cultures of India and Pakistan. I felt like I spent the afternoon in the company of a good friend, who showed us a side of the area that we would never have been able to see on our own. Even our teenage daughter enjoyed the tour - and paid what for her is the ultimate complement when she said that she wished that Mr. Ali were her history teacher (he is a history teacher at a local high school).
