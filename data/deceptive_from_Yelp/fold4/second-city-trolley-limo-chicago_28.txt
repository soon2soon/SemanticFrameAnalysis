This company did not give us the greatest experience.  We used this company for a trolley on our wedding day.  The place of business is not the most professional looking.  The first time we tried to meet Thomas and see what the trolleys looked like in person, the person meeting us did not show up.  We rescheduled a week later and were able to see the trolleys ok.  Bahar is better to work with and gave us more confidence in the company, however this changed completely on our wedding day.  We signed a contract with them to originally pick up the bridal party at 2:00pm.  We changed the contract over email several months before the wedding to be 1:45 and confirmed this twice, with two different people, over the phone the week of the wedding.  Bahar assured me that the trolley would actually get there at 1:30 so that we could load everything on it and be able to leave at 1:45.  On our wedding day, the trolley didn't show up until 1:50 and the driver made no apologies.  He said the contract time was for 2:00.  The driver also didn't have our scheduled routes that we had provided to the company.  Thomas had assured us that the driver would have the route that we provided.  Thankfully, I had another copy of the route with me so that the driver knew where to go without me telling him the whole way.  All in the all, we ended up getting to the church on time (although not as early as we wanted) and the trolley ride after the ceremony was fun and our driver got us around the city fast to take our bridal party pictures at various scenic locations.  Things ended up being fine with this company, but I would hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
