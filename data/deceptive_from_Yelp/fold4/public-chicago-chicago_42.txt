My partner and I just had 2 amazing weekend stays at the Public this month, and we keep raving about our experiences to our friends.  The ambiance is luxurious but comfortable, and the service was personable, attentive, friendly, and gracious.  Throughout our recent stay, we continued to be showered with surprise gratuities from the staff, including a bottle of prosecco sent to our room, a free coffee at breakfast, 2 complimentary desserts in the Pump Room, and a complimentary appetizer from one of the beautiful bar girls.  Christopher, the concierge, was always there to greet us and check in with us about our day, and he recommended some awesome restaurants for us to enjoy.  This is our new favorite place to stay in the Gold Coast.   The room, also, was very beautiful and comfortable.  Sleek and modern.  We'll definitely be back.  :)
