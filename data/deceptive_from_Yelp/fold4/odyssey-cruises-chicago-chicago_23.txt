We went last night.  The food was remarkable.  And they said Chicago didn't have a classy restaurant on the lake!  Of course, the views were without compare, and the mild fog make it that much more romantic.  As always, staff was great and the mood was happy. Only negative was the DJ in the Sapphire room.  Admittedly, that room did not have a dancing crowd, but the selection of music did not help.  Unless you like Frank Sinatra.  The crowd was indeed old, but now old means grew up in the 60s, not the 40s.  My girlfriend went up and asked him if he had any Elton John.  "Does he do slow stuff?" the DJ asked - I kid you not.   We snuck up to the private party on the higher deck (baseball executives and staff, it seemed) where they had a fabulous DJ who was rocking the place to an appreciative crowd.  He was very welcoming - "Join the party!" and turned a near-miss cruise into THE PERFECT CRUISE!
