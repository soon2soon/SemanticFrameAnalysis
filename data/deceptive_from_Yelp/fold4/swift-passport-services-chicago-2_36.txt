I used this company to obtain a tourist visa for Brazil.  Excellent service, fast and very reasonably priced.  Plus, and this is huge for me - dealing with the Brazilian consulate is ridiculous - Swift Passport actually advised to apply for a 10-year multi-entry visa, when they norm is 5-yr IF you are lucky.  They've also been know to issue 90-day, multi's - which are almost useless.  A simple letter with my packet and voila!, a 10-yr visa.  Just so you know, that saved me $250+ (the cost of a new visa 5 years from now).  Friendly, knowledgeable staff and quick.  Use these guys, you won't regret it.
