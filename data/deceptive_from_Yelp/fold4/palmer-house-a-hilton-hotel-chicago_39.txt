This rating is based on the NYE 2013 party at the Palmer House, which was the responsibility of the hotel and was badly executed.  40 minute line just to check in, 40 minute line to get a drink, and substandard amenities for the expense.  As much as I have thought well of the hotel in the past, I do not plan on revisiting it due to the extremely poor value I received for a $160 ticket.
