As a member of the art world, soho house really intrigued me. I Went there last night for an event with my friend who was a member. The event was for a Tipsy Zine nail art magazine and the nail artist was giving manicures. The event was supposed to last from 8pm to 10pm. The manicures didn't start until about 8:45pm. Fine they were free. But I only got one complimentary cocktail while waiting several hours. By 11pm I still hadn't gotten my nails done ( they had extended the party from 10pm to 11pm). Another party goer sat down not knowing that there was still a line and while I was initially annoyed, I realized it was because one of the nail technicians said it was a free for all. The host of the event Joey could not have been more rude. When we asked about timing she completely snubbed us. I saw her actually yelling at a guest, telling her she should leave is she wasn't satisfied. What happened to the customer always being right? Talk about AWFUL customer service. I then heard the same host complaining about the members to a nearby bartender. Soho House is supposed to have top notch staff. So I thought. After 3 and a half hours of waiting neither my friend nor I were able to receive a manicure. It was a complete waste of a night. Aside from the two talented nail artists, the event was not even cool. They didn't even offer to comp a round of drinks for the inconvenience. The experience and host left such an awful taste in my mouth. My friend and I were considering renting the "Library" for a company event but the thought of dealing with their team seems like a nightmare. The host made the ladies at the Wiener Circle seem professional. I will think twice about applying to become a member or even accepting an invitation to another event.
