The staff here and their customer service was really what struck me most about the Park Hyatt. I got such a great first impression! The room was amazing with a beautiful view, and there was an oversized Jacuzzi tub in the room which was so awesome because that's one of my favorite things to have in a room. Especially if there's a nice bottle of White Zin involved! I highly recommend the Park Hyatt to anyone who is looking for an extraordinary place to stay.
