Do not contact this company for even a quote! I made the mistake of giving my work number and email address. Nour Mihaileanu called me repeatedly 10+ times in a row! I didn't answer, but I have called ID. Finally, he left a message and then called back 2 seconds later. I picked up the phone and told him to quite calling and sent an email asking them to quit calling. He sent me a rude email back claiming it wasn't him, even though I have called ID. And now the calls have stopped! Funny... And, their quote was way overpriced. Oh, and he continues to email me. Stay away from this company if you don't want to be harassed!
