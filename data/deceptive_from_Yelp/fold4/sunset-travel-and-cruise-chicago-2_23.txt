We worked with Jay at Sunset Travel to help us plan our wedding in Riviera Maya, Mexico.  We can't begin to say enough wonderful things about Jay and his team.  They took the very best care of us and our group and always had our best interest in mind.  They did a great job of explaining all of our options for our group and were always extremely organized with our large group.  I would absolutely recommend them and intend to use them again for any travel plans that I make.
