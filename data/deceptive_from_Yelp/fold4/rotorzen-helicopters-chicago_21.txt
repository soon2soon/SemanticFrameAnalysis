The location is perfect for all the sites just yards from the Mag mile. The room although historical was kept exceptionally clean throughout our stay. We did have the lovely buffet breakfast on the first morning but we think it's a little on the expensive at 44 dollars for two after tax so didn't have it again but went out to the corner bakery just round the corner where we thought the value was much better.
