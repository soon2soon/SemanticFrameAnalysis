Definitely recommend this tour! The segways were easy and SO MUCH FUN to ride! Our tour guides were fun and very educated on the history of our Wonderful city of Chicago! This was a great tour and a fun, new experience! Price is also affordable and well worth the price for this wonderful experience!
