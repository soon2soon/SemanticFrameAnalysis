Bar and Lounge had an amazing ambiance but the hotel rooms were another story - severely under decorated, beds were nearly on the ground and the bathroom was ill equipped and tiny. I was expecting so much more based on their website pictures but was extremely disappointed to the point of canceling the next two nights and switching hotels. The staff was very friendly and helpful but the overall experience was definitely not worth the premium price per night.
