This is my first review ever on yelp and in fact created the account just to write this review. This hotel was by far the worst I've ever stayed at. Coming into the hotel I stood in a line for about fifteen minutes because of the single front desk worker, which did not set the stage well. The rooms are small and incredibly overpriced. I have a strong allergy to gluten so when dinner came around I called room service and asked if they had a GF substitute for their pasta. It cost $6 extra for gluten free pasta on top of the $20 it cost for the original dinner!!! Is it made of gold?! My boyfriend and I settled for two grilled chicken sandwiches (mine without the bread). Â The bill came back as $70 (which was obviously a mistake). Later we found out about the 18% service charge AND $4 delivery charge! What?! You're literally just getting in and out of an elevator not driving across town.. Worst hotel prices, service, and quality ever.
