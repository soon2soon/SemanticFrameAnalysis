After renting with Enterprise for a long time and always being hit with hidden charges and then having to fight with customer service reps, I decided to try something new. Relay rides has been great!  Lots of cars available, easy booking online..  I also think its kind of cool to just borrow a strangers car for a while.   The only negative here is the full coverage insurance option seems to be the same price as the car rental fee. It would be great if they could somehow find a way to get their insurance coverage rates down, but overall it is still a really great service that I would recommend to anyone over the national car rental chains.
