We're here for  2 nights and  first night was fine as we checked in late. however, the second night was brutal as my wife's dust allergy triggered and all out plans got stalled. We had requested the hotel to have a dust free room before we had checked in. The room service was covered in dust and upon complaining we're given all sorts of lame excuses by the hotel manager and when all those excuses were debunked, she started apologising and offered complimentary breakfast if we stayed one more night on our own expense. Really? I was not ready to pay $300 for staying another day for the their fault. And now the negotiation started - first pay 50% and the pay 25% of that day's tariff...really??? Is that what's expected from a world class hotel? I felt like I was speaking to someone in a shady motel and negotiating for a deal...and upon mentioning that I will be sharing this my experience online....I was advised by her that threatening her won't help. Is sharing your experience online with others the same thing as threatening someone? Based on this experience, I decided to pay more and stay elsewhere than stay at this hotel for the third. At checkout, I was asked by the gentleman there whether i needed any help. And, upon narrating my sour experience to him, all I heard was an apology after each line of my narration. I would never ever stay nor recommend anyone to stay at this hotel in unless you want to experience customer service equivalent to cheap 3rd class service expected from a cheap budget hotel/ motel, and hear only apologies for their mistakes  and no proper action is taken for their mistakes.
