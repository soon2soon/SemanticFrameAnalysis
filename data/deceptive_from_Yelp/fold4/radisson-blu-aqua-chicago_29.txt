I recently had the opportunity to return to this hotel twice in the past week (one time for for fun and the other for business). I am a single parent so I usually do not have a lot of time to devote to writing reviews, but I feel writing about this this hotel is worth the time. My two stays were truly fantastic. The first one needed some special planning around it, and the person I spoke with in the manager's office was very helpful and accurate with my requests. In addition, upon check in there was an emergency I had to deal with and I needed to get to my bank. The front desk staff and concierge quickly found out where the local branch of my bank was in relation to the hotel, called there to make sure they were still open, and then I was able to get everything taken care of. For the second stay there was an accidental ovebooking on my part, and again the front desk staff was helpful and was able to resolve it in a timely manner. Aside from the logistics of my two stays, the facility itself is very clean, the atmosphere welcoming, and the fitness cetner and other amenities are way above satisfactory. The food in the restarant, Filini, is also very tasty.
