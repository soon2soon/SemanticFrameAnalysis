I did the wicker park tour and it was great. Not only do you get to try some outstanding food but you also get to see and learn about some great historic buildings and sites. Our tour guide Jake was also amazing, he knew a lot about Chicago and the facts behind everything we ate and viewed. I would recommend this tour to anybody from Chicago or visiting. You'll be surprised what you don't know even when you spent your entire life in this beautiful city. Â Hats off to the sidewalk tour what a great time.
