I have to give Chicago Rolls Royce Limo a full five stars, but please note the following story. I did not actually use their service. Four days before a bachelor party I had scheduled, the bachelor was in an accident and could not do the party. I had paid a $250 deposit on the trolley rental, and the total cost for the evening was scheduled to be $720. As the company, someone canceling on you for that amount of money last-minute like is disappointing for sure. Thomas, however, could not have been more understanding about it, and he immediately refunded by deposit (while I was still on the phone with him). Thomas said, and I quote, "I don't want to take any money I haven't earned." What a great interaction I had with this company without even having a transaction. But I will be telling my friends to use this company, and I intend to use them for any future events as well. So while I have not experienced the execution of their services, I feel justified in giving this business 5 stars based on very great customer service.
