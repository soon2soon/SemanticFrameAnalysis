I was recommended to Rami and Scuba Sensations through a friend- I would classify myself as someone hoping to take PADI certification seriously and learn it the right way. I was impressed with the experience. Rami was technically oriented and made sure we understood the fundamentals and safety necessary for a lifetime of good diving practices. He has a gift for teaching and always led into his lessons with the end in mind. Moreover Rami made the process fun. He and his staff are really warm, hysterical people. I walked away more excited for my next dive. Flat out this was a great experience- I would recommend to anyone.
