Having a car in Chicago is expensive and parking can be really difficult, but there are definitely occasions when it would come in handy. RelayRides is the perfect solution. This service is really great, and what car-sharing should be. The rates are unbeatable, and set by the car owner; in most cases, RelayRides is much more affordable than other car-sharing programs out there. They are also really great in terms of communication - with text and email reminders of when your reservation starts and ends. And they put you in direct touch with the car owner so you can communicate as needed. This is really like a car-sharing community and you get to meet people who live near you and each of you benefits from the service! It is also really easy to enroll. Highly recommended for those of us who don't want to commit to car ownership in the city, but need to drive somewhere every now and again.
