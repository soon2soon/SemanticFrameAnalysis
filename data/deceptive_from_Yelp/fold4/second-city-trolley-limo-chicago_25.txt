This wound up being a horrifying experience.  This trolley had no working air conditioning on a very hot day!  And we were taking on-site pictures throughout the city for 3 hours!  After we complained, the driver said he could do nothing.  I tried to tough it out, just to get through it and try to think positively.  Then....it broke down.  We had to wait 20 minutes for a new one.  They never even warned me before it arrived or asked me if I would like a replacement before the wedding.  It was evident there was a problem with the trolley from the beginning. We complained afterward and Thomas admitted all that went wrong, but said they provided a new one in reasonable time.  I expected a dependable service, and did not get it.  It was hugely embarrassing to be stuck on a busy street in Chicago waiting for a working trolley.  I'm disgusted with this company.  A total waste of money!  Stay away!
