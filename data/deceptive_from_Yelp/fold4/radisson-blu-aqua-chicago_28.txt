Recently i had the opportunity to stay at the Radisson Blu Aqua downtown Chicago. I was very happy with the accommodations in the room. The design was very thoughtful and up to date which I appreciated. The best part by far was not the Hotel or the bar, however they were great! The people and staff that run this hotel were top notch, kind, considerate and always very friendly. I will definitely be back for this reason!
