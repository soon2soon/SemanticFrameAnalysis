Hire some nicer people at the ticket windows... I don't appreciate me buying a ticket and getting attitude like I'm wasting their time or don't say a single word to me. CLEAN THE BATHROOMS MORE. It's so disgusting every time I go in. Also, crack down on the homeless people... I'd like to not be heckled in the restroom... or be asked for half of my Subway sandwich. Otherwise my train is almost always right on time if not a couple of minutes late. A nice selection of stores and restaurants, and lots of space so I don't feel cramped between people.
