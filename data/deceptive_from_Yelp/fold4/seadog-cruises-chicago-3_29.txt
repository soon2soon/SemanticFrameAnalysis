Took the architectural tour which starts with a couple of higher speed (not too fast) loops in Lake Michigan to give everyone on board a view of the Chicago skyline. Our emcee, Grant, was very entertaining and full of city knowledge. He kept the cruise lighthearted, even when we were waiting for the Chicago River Locks to open. This is a great way to see parts of the city which you never view unless you have a boat and travel through the Chicago River.
