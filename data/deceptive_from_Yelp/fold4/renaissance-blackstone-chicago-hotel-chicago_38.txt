Lovely hotel for a long weekend with my husband. The rooms are comfy, roomy and beautiful as well (though I agree about the sliding door to the bathroom not providing enough privacy when needed) but I still cannot for life of me understand why hotels have the nerve to try to charge $12.95 for WIFI. It was free in the lobby but you had to pay for it in the rooms. Yeah...no thanks. I used the web browser on my Droid, thankyouverymuch. Great location, especially if you want to walk about the park and take in the museums.
