I finally decided to start using National as my company has a corporate account and using the Emerald club would be really easy. It was easy to go straight to the garage and pick a car, but there were not any premium cars available so they said upgrade and take a small SUV for the same price! I thought great, but once I got on the highway this SUV had no pick up at all and sounded like it was going to blow up. At this time I looked at the gauges to see what the tach said and realized it only had a 1/4 tank of gas! So I called and spoke to CS and they put me on hold for 5 minutes and came back with it was corrected with the Midway office so i would not be charged for what I didn't receive, but when I dropped the car off in Milwaukee a few hours later I still was charged for the missing gas! I even put in 5 gallons before I dropped it back off getting it over a 1/4 tank. The counter in Milwaukee said they couldn't help as I rented from Midway! Another issue I have it the charge for Extra miles! part of our corporate deal is to have unlimited miles on Emerald Aisle rentals. Just because I decided to upgrade for a few dollars more to a premium car I get hit with .40 cents a mile! Which in the end cost me double! Don't let the attendant direct you to a car. Pick your own!
