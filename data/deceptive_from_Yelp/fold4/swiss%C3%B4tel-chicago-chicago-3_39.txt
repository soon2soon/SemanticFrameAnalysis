Stayed here four nights for a conference plus the weekend. The rooms and views are great. Location was ok and on a not too busy street (Wacker). Easy walk to shopping and dining. The service was an issue for me. I can give several examples of unfriendly and unhelpful staff. Also the restaurants aren't very convenient.
