My Fiance and I stayed here at the end of July.  Hotel, Fine.  Shower...little weird but was new and bathroom was clean.  Big problem...Valet!  Super expensive and not nice.  We waited for 15-20 minutes for my car.  My fiance asked after about 10 minutes "does it usually take this long?" and the guy started giving him an attitude.  Not impressed.  ZERO customer service and at the end of the day I'll stay somewhere else and have my car back in a reasonable time frame.
