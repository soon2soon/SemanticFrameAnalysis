Our family was on vacation and decided to take a boat tour. I bought the tickets on line because of a recommendation from a couple at our hotel and I was told the tours sell out. I bought the tickets, went to will call two hours before the tour and picked up the tickets. The very friendly will call attendant handed me my tickets and said make sure you come early, boats are loaded first come first serve basis. We arrived for our boat 30 min early and we were first in line to get on the boat. As my kids stood in line they were picking out the best places to sit on the boat and asking the boat captain what his opinion was. When it was time to board the boat, a group of 52 people that were not waiting in line were escorted to the boat as we stood their. I asked the captain why this was allowed he said talk to the supervisor he is the one who allowed it. Â My kids felt very cheated because they had waited in line like we were instructed to do, only to get seats towards the back of the boat. The boat ride and architecture tour were very informative, but when your boat ride started like ours, it does not make you feel like a valued customer and would not recommend it to others with out checking to make sure groups are not allowed before you. Also after spending almost $100 on the 75 min tour, to ask for tips for the guide because he does his own research seemed like pouring salt in the wound.
