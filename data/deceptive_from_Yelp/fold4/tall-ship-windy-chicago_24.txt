Avoid buying any type of daily deal like LIVING SOCIAL for the Tall Ship Windy.  You will regret it and will not get a refund.    The first time we went to use our living social voucher the ship was booked.  Not sold out but booked by a private party.   Another reviewer had the same issue so don't think that they are posting twice.  You can not book in advance, you have to go to the Navy Pier ticket window the day of the cruise.   The next time we went to use it was a week after it expired but we still wanted to use the face value of the voucher but to our surprise the ship is GONE FOR THE WHOLE MONTH OF AUGUST.  That's right, it left Chicago and won't be back until September.    The only way to know this was to go to their website and see a small blurb in the lower left hand corner OR go to Navy Pier, pay $25 to park, and then see that the ticket booth is closed with no information at all about why it is closed, SORRY KIDS!   Bad business!  There was no help from Living Social.   No refunds outside of their refund period.
