Spice of Life Tours is an eye opening South Asian adventure in the heart of Chicago's North Side!! I have been to Devon Ave. before. It can be daunting trying to navigate the restaurants and stores. Where to go? What to eat? Are you getting the best value? You have little background information to make a decision. Spice of life Tours takes you through the area with a view toward the cultural, historical and geographical back story of the South Asian community of Devon Ave.  And boy, do you get fed!!  And pampered by your guide (Ali) and the business owners!! And wine, and discounts on current and future purchases!! All I can say is GO!
