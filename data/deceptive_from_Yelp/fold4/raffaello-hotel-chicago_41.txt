Spent Saturday night at the Raffaello with girlfriends from out of state.  Our experience was excellent!  We used a discount certificate and expected to be given the worst rooms.  Our experience was the opposite.  We were upgraded to suites and treated wonderfully.  The text follow ups from guest services were great.  The staff -from the doormen to the front desk -were friendly and professional.  The Drum Bar was a great spot to end a fun day in the city.  We can't wait to come back when the weather isn't 25 below zero.  The building is Vintage - so the elevators are small and slow.  But the ambiance is great.
