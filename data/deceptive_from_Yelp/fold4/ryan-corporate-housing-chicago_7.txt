I am in Chicago to help out before and after the birth of my grandchild.  I agree with everything that has been written about Ryan Corporate Housing.  What's more, I've had occasion to stay in corporate housing in other cities with other vendors and there is no comparison!  It's like apples to oranges--not the same at all. I am staying at a brand new building, 111 W. Wacker Dr. in a one-bedroom apartment.  I had the pleasure of speaking with Ryan before I signed on, and he told me that he liked outfitting each apartment that they sublet with furnishings unique to that apartment.  That care is evident in the space that I've rented.  They did not go to Walmart or Ikea to buy furniture.  When I walk through my door at the end of the day in a city that isn't my home, I walk into a welcoming space that is furnished with high-end furniture.  It is not some depressing, dirty unit with threadbare furnishings.  I can relax and feel at home--something that is important when on the road.  I look forward each night to climbing into my very comfortable bed that is outfitted with high threadcount sheets; I'm not counting the days until I can return to my own home.  I'm at peace here.   Initially, I had some problems with my cable service, but John dropped everything on a Sunday night to come right over and readjust settings and cables so that I could watch my favorite program.  That goes well above and beyond the service offered by other lessors.  They also accommodated my request for an air mattress so that I could have visitors over Thanksgiving, and they kindly purchased a small crate for my Maltese dog so that I would not have to go to the trouble of bringing one here. Great job Ryan Corporate Housing; kudos to you!
