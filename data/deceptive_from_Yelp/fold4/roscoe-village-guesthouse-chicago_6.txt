For the price of a hotel, you get a full kitchen and nice living quarters.  Good for a larger group of people,  but not what it claims!  My fiance and I went for a relaxing weekend, but the jacuzzi did not work at all.  It was simply a bath tub with jets that did not work!  The Wi-fi did not work anywhere in our unit outside the room with the modem.  I really expected more.
