The Raffaello is solid. It is a bit pricey, but for what they offer, it is not a bad value. Kuerig coffee. Large HD TVs in room, etc. Bed is very very comfortable. 2nd time staying there and they upgraded us to a suite. It was one of those throwaway suites (no view, a few quirks) they keep around for such things, but a suite none the less. I couldn't complain. We asked for extra hangers and extra coffee and they sent them right up. They were very attentive overall. Good experience. Only bad thing: no free wifi in room or business center. I'm sorry but that is a real downer. If there is no wifi free, at least have a business center that does not charge for internet.
