This Segway tour was the best thing we did on Chicago! Casey and Andrew were our tour guides and they were very informative, personable, and funny! I really enjoyed this experience and learned a lot about Chicago. It is the best way to get to see the city and you have fun while doing so! I saw other Segway tours but this one seemed the best and most legit. I highly recommend the Segway experience of Chicago!
