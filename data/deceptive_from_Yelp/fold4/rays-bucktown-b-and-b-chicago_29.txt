My son lives in the adjoining neighborhood called Wickerpark so staying at Ray's in the adjoining neighborhood of Bucktown was VERY convenient.  I found it on google and was unable to find more recent reviews online but when I called they couldn't have been more accommodating with my inquiry. I arrived at the Western stop on the Blue line from O'Hare and couldn't find a cab, called Rays to ask for a cab co. # and instead Ray came to pick me up and brought me to my new "home away from home".  The staff could NOT have been more helpful, congenial or hospitable.  Over the 3 days I was there I couldn't have been more pleased.   I stayed in The Room With a View in the main building which is a climb up a winding staircase and where at night I'd have to step over a black cat.  Somehow he/she was never there in the morning.  The room was clean,bright sunshine in the morning and the shower and BR perfect.  The TV didn't work, but I'm not a TV subscriber.   My son joined me for breakfast both mornings and we didn't get hungry again till dinnertime.  The food is made to order and I came home with the recipe for their fruit compote which I piled high on top of my multigrain toast each morning.   This place is a jewel of a find and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
