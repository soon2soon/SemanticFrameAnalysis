We had a company event aboard the Odyssey and it was flawless from start to finish!!  We took the Air and Water Show Cruise.  The view of the show from the ship was amazing.  Despite the fact that the ship was filled to capacity, we never felt like it was too crowded or that there were too many people.  We were able to view the air and water show from the top deck.  It was breathtaking.  The food and service was equally impressive.  I will definitely plan another cruise on the Odyssey
