I recently visited this hotel for a special occasion. What an amazing hotel! The staff is wonderful. I first called the hotel to book a one night stay and asked if there were any special amenities I could purchase for a birthday celebration for the love of my life.Without hesitation, they quickly responded and upgraded my room to a suite with complimentary champagne. When I came to the hotel to prepare for the occasion, I was greeted by a professional and courteous staff that offered to help me with my bags. Not to mention the suite was beautiful and the view stunning. This is one of the hidden gems of chicago and I plan on coming back fairly often.
