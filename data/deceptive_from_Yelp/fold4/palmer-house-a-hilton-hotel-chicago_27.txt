The employees were really outstanding, always helpful and very nice. Some were a little more forceful when it came to tipping but overall the staff was great. I loved the hotel, historic and regal, and interesting. The pool was great as was the hot tub. Though $10 a day to use the fitness facility was absolutely ridiculous. The bed was pretty comfortable and the room was a good size though the bathroom was small. And speaking of the bathroom, prepare yourself for the most annoying shower experience you will ever have. The shower pressure was like "Silkwood" time, the spray was far too powerful, and there was no way to adjust it. So a word of advice...never let the spray hit you in any place that's sensitive including the face. The other annoyance of the spray being so powerful was that it caused the shower curtain to billow into the tub. So it was a constant struggle to get unstuck from the shower curtain. The sides of the tube were slanted in so things often fell in and the shower didn't drain well so you were always standing in water. Wifi wasn't too bad at $12 a day but you had to pay for every device individually which was irritating. The location of the hotel with regards to Chicago was awesome, we walked everywhere. Navy Pier was a hike but we walked all the way up Mag Mile and all the way down Michigan Ave the other direction with no problem. I'm not sure if I'd want to stay there again because of the shower and fee for the fitness facility but definitely had a great time in Chicago!
