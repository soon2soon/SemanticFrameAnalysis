not happy with Southwest Airlines policy of making you use your banked dollars within one year. especially when you TRIED to use them but because THEY didn't answer their phone, you couldn't. Now you are stuck. Everybody loves Southwest but the dirty secret is they get you coming and going. Be forewarned!
