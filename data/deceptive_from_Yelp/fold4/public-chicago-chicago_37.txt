I stayed at Public this weekend and it was great!  The building is beautiful, and the decor is very glamorous downstairs.  The rooms aren't big but are modern and minimalist, with everything you need.  The location is within a short walk from Lake Michigan and Michigan Ave, or the Magnificent Mile, with all of the department stores, luxury shopping, and many famous restaurants.  But luckily by being just a few blocks away from the center the hotel misses out on the traffic and noise that I'm sure are an issue for some of the more centrally located hotels. The bar was very popular every night, and packed on Friday.  The Pump Room was also always full starting around 7pm, both full of dressed up people who were not all guests of the hotel.  It was a fun scene and although I went out to Blackbird instead of staying in the hotel, it was fun to have a drink in the bar. The hotel was a perfect location and you could spend a whole weekend there without needing to go anywhere else.  It had a fun atmosphere and functional comfortable rooms.  I'd definitely return!
