We just returned from a trip to Chicago and found Raffaello on Groupon, which is a great deal.  The location is perfect and while I agree with other reviews about the small elevators and helpfulness (or lack there of) staff, those are not what earns this hotel only a 3-star hotel.   It was 40 to 45 degree each day we were in town and yet our room was stifling hot.  We had the thermostat set to cool and turned it down to 50 and yet the room was miserably warm.  We called down to the front desk and they sent someone up who said we just open the windows.  Opening the windows worked, but I don't feel like that is a good solution.  ESPECIALLY, when we were on the 2nd floor and therefore had to decide between a comfortable temperature and street noise or sweating with a quiet room.   Also, I did not appreciate the texts from the staff.  We did not share our number so that we could have the staff "checking in" with us repeatedly.
