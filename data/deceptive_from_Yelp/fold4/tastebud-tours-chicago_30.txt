Our guide, Jamie Lynn, told us many stories about the rich history of the town of Chicago, which I found to be very interesting. I learned a lot of new things about the city. The food was very good, this was my first time to Chicago and a very good way to at least get a sample of the different staples in the city. I would recommend this for anyone who would like to try the foods of Chicago. My favorite was the pizza at Pizanos, and the story behind it was awesome.
