Wrom so many more modern hotels. The staff was friendly and efficient and seemed to truly enjoy helping the guests. Any special request we had, like additional towels, was taken care of in minutes. We had great food in all of the restaurants and lounges .How can you go wrong with Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and a great martini? I can't wait to visit Chicago again and stay at the Drake.
