Great hotel. My fianc√© and I stayed here last weekend. The bathroom was very nice. Super modern and a decent size. Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. And the staff was very nice. We ate at the Nix restaurant downstairs which was very affordable for a fancy hotel restaurant downtown Chicago.
