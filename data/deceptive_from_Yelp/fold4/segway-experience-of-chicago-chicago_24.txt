If you are looking for fantastic way to spend time and some money in the Loop,head to Segway Experience of Chicago. We had the times of our lives.The people were so much fun,in group and guides. We learned some very interesting facts and went through Grant Park to Solders Field and back. It can be a tad intimadating at first but the pros there showed us in short order how to manage the Segways and had us riding and laughing like we have always done this. Â Our guides Clay and Raybon,Sorry guys can't always remember names,but the experience was not to be missed. Would we do this again...without a doubt.
