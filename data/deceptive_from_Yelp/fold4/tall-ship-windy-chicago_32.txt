Had a great time on the Lighthouse History tour with Pirate Dave and Mr. Olson.  Crew was extremely friendly, Pirate Dave told great stories, and our whole family had fun.  My daughter was listening more closely than I realized, because she referenced the lighthouse tales several times in the following days.
