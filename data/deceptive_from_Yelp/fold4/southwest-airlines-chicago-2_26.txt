I would give a negative 0 if it were possible. I purchased 6 tickets on SW for Disney and 1 person was not able to depart and tried to call to change the ticket, could not get through prior to the plane departing.  Then was told to call customer relations that number is fake it is busy for days and weeks.  I wrote a letter to Gary Kelly and got a post card saying someone would contact me that was 3 weeks ago.  At the time of purchase I actually purchase 9 flights on SW, you would think they would care to keep my business.  I would never use SW, there are so many options with good customer service.  SW you can keep ignoring people, they will continue to blog and openly discuss your poor service in public settings and get others to stop using your bus in the air, that still serves peanuts, with all the kids with peanut allergies.
