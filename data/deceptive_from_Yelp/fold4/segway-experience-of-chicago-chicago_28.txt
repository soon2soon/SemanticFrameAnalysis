A spectacular day !!!  I ordered an online tour certificate for Segway Experience of Chicago in early December, I had a day off scheduled mid-week.  I called ahead to reserve the Wednesday, and headed downtown on the train.  Dan had to make special arrangements for my daytime tour guide and Damien stepped up to the task.  I was open on itinerary and Architecture is a love for both of us, we had a spontaneous adventure.  I am an older woman and had every accommodation for safety and comfort while having the experience of a lifetime in my favorite city. Damien is so knowledgeable of the history, architecture, and sights of Chicago.  He taught me so much and I could even offer some info I have gathered over the years.  I am so impressed by the professionalism and courtesy I experienced with the Segway Experience of Chicago.  I will be a repeat guest and will highly recommend it for all my friends and if I can do it at 65 with comfort and safety, you can too !!  I can't wait to have my daughters join me in the next year.
