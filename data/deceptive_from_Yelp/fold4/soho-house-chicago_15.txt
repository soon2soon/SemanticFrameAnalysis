Some friends wanted to try this place, so I decided to give it another try I really want to like this place. The Chef needs to work on his menu it has no imagination and his plating skills are to rustic. The food is to blah and way to salty, for god sake Chef learn how to use spices not just salt. Still don't like this place and the attitude of the people here isn't the greatest either, I think it's a bad combination of snobby and races.
