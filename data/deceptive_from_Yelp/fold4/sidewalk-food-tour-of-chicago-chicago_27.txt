I, with a friend, recently took the Wicker Park Sidewalk Food Tour of Chicago. We skipped breakfast in hopes of some tasty treats along the way and we were not disappointed! We were thrilled with the food choices and loved the history/neighborhood/cultural information we heard along the way. Jake knew the neighborhood very well, both retail and residential, and shared his enthusiasm with the group. The pace of the tour was relaxed and leisurely; there was plenty of time to chat and get to know some of the other people on our tour. This tour introduced me to a great neighborhood I hadn't visited before. I would recommend this for locals and tourists, especially those that like to experience the local flair. I'm looking forward to doing the River North tour next time. But for now, I want some more fried chicken!
