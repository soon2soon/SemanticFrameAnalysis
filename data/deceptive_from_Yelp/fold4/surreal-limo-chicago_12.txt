Surreal limo is wonderful. We rented one of their party buses for my friends 40th birthday party. The bus it's self was amazing! Very clean, had lights, tvs and plenty of room. It's the type of party bus you see in the movies. Low deposit of 100. Customer service from James Wilson was above and beyond the norm. Highly recommend!
