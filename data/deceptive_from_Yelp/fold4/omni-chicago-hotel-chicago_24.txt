We had our June wedding ceremony and reception at the Omni Chicago.  We knew from the minute we met Sarah that we wanted to work with her.  Sarah made us feel comfortable and was extremely responsive throughout the whole wedding planning process.  The day of our wedding was absolutely perfect, thanks to Sarah.  The rooms were beautiful and everything went off without a hitch.  We could not have asked for a better venue and wedding coordinator.  The Omni Chicago is the perfect Chicago venue!
