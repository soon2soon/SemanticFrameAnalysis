Yesterday was a first for us for the architectural tour of the Tall Ship Windy and we had a great time.  We have already mentioned our delight to our teenage kids and plan on going back again.  We were lucky to have beautiful weather, paired with the lively and friendly crew we couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Great picture taking too.
