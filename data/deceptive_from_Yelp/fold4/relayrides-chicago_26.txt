My car broke down on a Friday and I had to miss work because of it. I live in OC right now and getting to work without a car wasn't really a feasible option. And since I'm under 25, all car rental places were going to charge about  $100 surcharge--nevermind my squeaky clean driving record.  I found relayrides on craigslist, and it seemed like an answer to my prayers! But then it took me the whole weekend, and about 30 requests to actually get ONE person to accept. And then when I was entering in my payment information, it said there's a $500 deposit I'd have to pay, but it'd be returned if I didn't screw up the car, so I had to ask my dad for his card, because mine was maxed out paying for my car to be fixed. And then they gave me grief about the card not being in my name, but they said they'd let it slide this once. The car that I ended up getting was about 15 miles away--closest I could find. My friend drove me to the car on Sunday night, and on the way there, the owner told me that her battery died and she just needed a few minutes. When I got there, she had the car running, "Just in case the battery wouldn't start again." (So if I got home, turned the car back on and the battery wasn't working, then what?!) So I turned it off and on a few times just to make sure. The battery died once while I had the car, but luckily there was someone with jumper cables in the parking lot. You get what you paid for...if you're over 25 and willing to pay the extra $20, get a real rental car.
