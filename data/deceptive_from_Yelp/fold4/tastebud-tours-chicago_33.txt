The perfect blend of food and history! The owner, Lynn, and our tour guide, Jamie-Lynn, were fantastic. With only 2 days in the city I was looking to learn about the city and sample some classic Chicago fare along the way and Tastebud Tours more than delivered. With the inexpensive price tag ($44), I was worried (you get what you pay for, right?), but this was a top dollar experience. Highly recommend!
