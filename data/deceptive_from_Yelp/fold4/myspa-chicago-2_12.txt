MySpa is as good as it gets. It's relaxing atmosphere and top of the line customer service speaks for itself. The front desk staff immediately set the mood by offering a warm towel and aromatherapy to go along with my service. The front desk staff assisted me and took me through the locker room giving me a great tour and showing me my pre-set locker with a robe and slippers my size already in there. I absolutely loved the tea in the relaxation lounge and the massage was out of this world. I couldn't have asked for a better massage or overall experience. I could have even used their fitness center to work out in. Overall I was very very pleased with everything and can't wait to have another service!
