A seriously well informed, put together staff....from the Captains to the Docents to the Greeters. Shoreline is the only boat/sightseeing company in Chicago that I'll ever ride with. The architectural tour s phenomenal...worth taking as a repeat because each Docent has a different show, different info, jokes and anecdotes. One of the best ways to see the city is with Shoreline.
