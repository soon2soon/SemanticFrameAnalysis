The valet/parking company for this hotel ruined what could have been a wonderful stay.  The doorman all the way to the "valet manager" were extremely rude and relentless in squeezing every dime like they are running a racket.  After a long ride in on our motorcycles my friend and I asked if we could park them, hidden on the curb...we have done it at hotels such as the Ritz Carlton.  They insisted no.  First stating fire department issues, then that was switched to "we have an event tonight", to many other reasons. Fine, we park our bikes in their parking lot where they put us on one space and charge for two vehicles.  On top of that they demand with verbal force we hand them our keys, even thought they did not valet nor do any of them have a cycle license.  The whole thing is disgusting; the length they will go to lie and manipulate for cash.  It no longer became about money...it's the way they are conducting themselves.  If the Swissotel finds it fit to do business with this racket than I will never stay here again nor will I suggest it to anyone else.
