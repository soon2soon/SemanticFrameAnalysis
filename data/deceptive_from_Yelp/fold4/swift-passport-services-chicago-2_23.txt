yeah! these are great people. We (family of 5) are experienced travellers. But we foolishly tried to plan a trip to Brazil in less than 2 weeks-at World Cup time! (brazilian visas are not necessarily a quickie). I am not a novice at getting fotos, passports and birth certificates together in a brief period. Maybe I am too cavalier. A very able (and Brazilian born) San Francisco visa service couldnt pull it off...and he uses Swift as his "default/disaster" option. Without going into their mode of operation (they know the ropes)...we got our visas in 24-48 hours time. Always helps to plan ahead-but I didn't. It was the best money I have spent in a long time. And they are very nice and professional, Laurie calmly reassured me as I chewed my nails down. Have no fear. these people have integrity and capability. They saved us from Deep-Sixing our trip. and the trip was wonderful, as the Valium wore off. Don V., Seattle
