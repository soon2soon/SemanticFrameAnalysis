Stayed at Raffaello for 4 nights.  It was nice being right off North Michigan Avenue.  The hotel's location made it extremely easy to walk to multiple restaurants, stores, the beach, Navy Pier, and Lincoln Park Zoo. We stayed in a spacious suite that had 2 televisions and a wet bar.   This hotel could have got a 5/5 if the Sun Deck would have been open (closed for remodeling), and the room did not faintly smell like sewage.  We left the sink drain plugged for most of our stay and the smell still wafted into the sleeping area.  I do not know if this is an issue with the venting, or if all the rooms have this odor, but it was unpleasant.  Fortunately, there is plenty to do in Chicago and you do not have to sit in your room everyday. Overall, I would say that we will probably stay here in the future, if these two concerns are addressed.
