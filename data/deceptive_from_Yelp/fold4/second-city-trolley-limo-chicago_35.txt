My high school son and his friends booked the trolley to take them to a restaurant for homecoming. When we talked to Thomas to schedule, he was accomodating and helpful. On the day of the event, a company representative called to confirm along with an email. Randy, the driver, arrived on time and was very accomodating. He suggested that the kids might enjoy a tour down of Michigan Avenue, Buckingham Fountain and Navy Pier after dinner. They were very satisfied and pleased with the service. Hats off to Randy when dealing with a group of teens.
