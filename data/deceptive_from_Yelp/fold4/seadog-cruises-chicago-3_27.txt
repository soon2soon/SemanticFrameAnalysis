I highly recommend the 75 minute cruise with Dan. He's really friendly, entertaining and knowledgeable about the city. He made us laugh a lot. We started with the Thrill ride in the Lake, then the River Architectural Tour and then again (a bonus ride) to the Lake on a high speed. It was worth every penny spent.
