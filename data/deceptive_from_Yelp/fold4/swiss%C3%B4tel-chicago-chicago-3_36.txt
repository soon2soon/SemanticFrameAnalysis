Clean and comfortable but I've had enough. It took 2 days to get the hotel to fix the hotel network so I could get online (after 4 calls to the front desk and 2 hours on technical support).  After that the connection was "fixed" it was so terribly slow web pages took over a minute to load.   The Singapore Swissotel is much better, logged over 60 nights there last year.  When I tried to redeem my hotel points I was blocked from the dates I wanted to use even though there were open rooms.  I also had enough points good for a room upgrade.  Again blocked.  The Executive Club is closed on the weekends as well.
