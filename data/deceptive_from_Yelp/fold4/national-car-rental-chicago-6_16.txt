Given that it is International Customer Service Appreciation week, it is appropriate that I give a SHOUTOUT AND KUDOS, to the team at Midway Airport.  Over the weekend, I picked up a vehicle at Midway to drive to South Bend to watch Notre Dame beat Stanford.  I picked out a very nice Ford Fusion from the Emerald Isle, and proceeded to checkout. The checkout person greeted me with a BIG SMILE!  She answered my questions, and politely tried to up sell GPS and toll bypass. She also handled the checkout in moments. The return team Sunday night, was just as courteous and professional. My daughter wanted to pay for the rental this trip and when I asked if we could put the charges on her rental card, Station Manager Mehgan J., jumped in and took care of it in less than 5 minutes. She then gave me her card if there were any problems and offered to help out if I needed anything on my next trip to Chicago.   Mehgan and the team at Midway are complete PROS!!!
