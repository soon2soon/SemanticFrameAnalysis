Earlier today I experienced the glory that is the Ogilvie Transportation Center. Need a crab shaped pill box or a Jamocha shake? Ogilvie has you covered. Thousands of people pass through this urban crossroads each day, and the size of this place accommodates said travelers. With so much ground to cover- it took a tag team operation to body slam this review into existence. Enter Bryan. After an extensive survey of the many offerings - I can break the usefulness of this place down in a few key thoughts. Hudson News is a shit store, and there are three of them here - two of which face each other in a diagonal contest of who can suck the most. News stands aside, If you're a hat buying smoothie drinker - you're gonna be solid gold here. There are a lot of ways to spend your time and money at this place, and a few of them are gems - check out a store in the top right corner as you exit the escalators onto the second floor. You'll find everything from a bejeweled cheetah box to holographic Garfield stickers at this diamond in the rough. Now moving on to the most important aspect of this monument to greatness - the Food Court. You want Ribs? Get 'em. T-bell...oh hell yes, and don't think the Eastern cuisine is lacking here either. For this adventure I chose to get in the fast lane with Panda Express. Two entrees with a side and a side order of crab rangoons for under eight bucks - it's a fucking steal. Good food, and quick service left little to be desired. I guess I should clarify, by good food I mean that you get the food you expect to be getting. This isn't five star fare, but it gets the job done, and after you've done your job all day - why not treat yourself to a little sweet panda goodness. Then wash it all down with a green tea smoothie from Jamba Juice. Way to go Ogilvie - you've outdone yourself. Seriously though, Hudson News is a joke - there are at least five other options to purchase anything you could buy there for less money and more choice.
