I was in Chicago for a few months. Initially, I was with a different company, but I later switched to Ryan Corporate Housing and my only regret was that I did not stay there for the entire period. Nick, Ryan, and John were fantastic. Apart from the service was better than anything I had seen, the amenities provided had a touch of class. I recommend Ryan Corporate Housing to anyone that will be in Chicago. They are simply the best!
