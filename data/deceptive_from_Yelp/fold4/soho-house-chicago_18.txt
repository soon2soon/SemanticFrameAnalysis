Spent Saturday night at Soho in their main lobby bar as I'm not a member, and had a really great time. The ambiance is very cool with incredible design.  I'm sure when it's not Sat night it's probably a bit cozy.  We sat at this long communal tables were  beautiful.  Pleasant surprise that we were able to get a couple seats quickly.  Drinks were great. Giving it only 4 stars since our service was really really slow. I'll be back again on a slower night.
