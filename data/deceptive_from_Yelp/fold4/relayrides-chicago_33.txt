I needed a car urgent on Saturday and I came across RelayRides. I use a car only a couple times per year so I wanted something without annual fee. Also I wanted to return this car at night. I decided to try RelayRides and amazingly I had a great experience! I created an account in a couple minutes, found a car not far from me (with the shortest owner's response time) and sent a request. My request was approved in a couple minutes (I was really lucky - you should plan the trip before because the response can take a couple hours - Thank you, Robert!) and I got the address. I checked with owner if I can get the car earlier and came to the location. The car was ready. I didn't have any problem with the car and just returned it to the same place. I had to communicate with the owner and he was very nice. Also I had a couple questions and I sent an e-mail to RelayRides - and they responded promptly. Now I am going to use a car more than 2 times per year - I found RelayRides! Thank you so much!
