What can I say, this company was very helpful and professional for my event.  I hosted a bar hopping trolley on a Friday night recently.  When I called to book the office staff directed me to fill in the online booking form and all of the information was available on there for me. The office called to confirm everything, and then the driver Doug also called me earlier on the day of the event to confirm.   The event went well, Doug was very nice and on time, then when we had to extend the event for 2 additional hours Doug just made a phone call and the party went on!  I felt a little bad for him having to deal with our drunk butts for so long, but he seems like a genuinely great guy and he was a good spirit all night long! The trolley was really cute, and clean when it got there, and it was a unique and fun way to go out and to see the city at the same time.  The trolley had a great sound system.  I would certainly recommend these guys for a trolley rental any day!
