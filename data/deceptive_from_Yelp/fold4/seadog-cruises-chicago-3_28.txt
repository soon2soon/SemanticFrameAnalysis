I did the 75-minutes architectural speedboat tour and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Tour started out with a thrilling speedboat ride out on lake michigan for 10 mins or so. After that, we were off to the river to look at and learn about the rich architectural history of Chicago. Our guide Dan was very knowledgeable and presented all information in fun, relaxed, and entertaining manner. He welcomed all questions and answered them appropriately. After about 45 minutes on the river learning interesting factoids about various Chicago landmarks, we were brought back out on lake michigan for another 10 minutes of speedboat ride. The day was gorgeous, views of the city skyline from lake michigan spectacular, the ride thrilling, and the tour informative. You can't ask for more for $22 (groupon pricing)!
