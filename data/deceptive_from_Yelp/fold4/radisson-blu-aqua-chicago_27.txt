Love this hotel.  We stayed in the Park suite which was definitely with the extra $75 a night.  Perfect location, amazing views, and the staff was very friendly despite what other reviews said.   Decor is swanky and upscale, the suite was extremely clean (especially the bathrooms) and the lounge on the 17th floor had a great variety of great beers to choose from (domestic and foreign-low to top shelf). We can't wait to go back when the weather is warm and we can experience the outside pool deck.
