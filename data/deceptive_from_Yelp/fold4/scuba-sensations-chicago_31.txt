My fiance and I were given scuba diving lessons for an engagement gift. We were excited to try it, Rami and his staff made it a wonderful experience. Not only did we learn everything to be certified, but we had such a fun experience we want to dive with these guys again and again. I would recommend scuba sensations to anyone looking to learn or buy, because they are knowledgeable, fun, honest and generally good people.
