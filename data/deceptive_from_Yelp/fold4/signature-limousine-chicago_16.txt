Update:  Irina contacted me with her personal number so that I could get in touch with her even when she wasn't working.  When I called her back, she was kind enough to explain what her new driver meant by complicated and I believe her based on her details and explanation.   I appreciated her professional call and the time she took to express that she was sorry about the situation.  In fact, I'm giving them another chance and I don't think she'll disappoint.  If I'm not mistaken, she even offered a discount of some sort but to me making an effort to call alone was enough to make me a fan again.   It's nice to know you are not just another number and that some people do care about your business.
