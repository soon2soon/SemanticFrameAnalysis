I had a surprise 40th birthday luncheon cruise for my husband on April 14, 2012 on the Spirit of Chicago.  The cruise boarded and departed on time, the crew and manager of the ship were great.  The customer service was excellent.  The food was great.  The entertainment was fun.  We had a great time and the party was a great success.  I recommend this cruise to anyone looking to have a great time.  We will be cruising again!
