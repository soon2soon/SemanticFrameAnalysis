first off, i rent a car every week for work, every single week!!!  ive given a lot of my business in the past to this National branch because it is more convenient than going to one of the airports.  however, i am going to find another car rental company in the city because the counter help at this location is probably the worst level of customer service ive ever encountered.  the ladies that work behind the counter truly do not care about their jobs, and they do not realize its the customers renting the cars that pay their checks.  both of the managers adam and alex are doing the best they can with a bad situation.  i am convinced that adam and alex deeply care about their customers and they have helped me out in so many situations when cars werent available or there was a mechanical issue with the car... but they can only do so much with a location that is continually out of cars and has very little selection.  i also want to say the people downstairs in the garage are very friendly and i enjoy talking with them when returning my car.  its too bad the folks at the counter care so little about the success of their branch.  if i decide to give them one more chance and should things change, i will update my post and give them a higher rating if customer service improves.
