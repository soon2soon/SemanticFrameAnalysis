A consummate professional, Belal is the best chauffeur you'll ever meet. He knows Chicagoland like the back of his hand and always arrives early with alternative routes for any situation. A true pleasure to work with each and every trip, dedication is his middle name. From sports scores, conventions and travel times to your flight's current status, Belal always has the latest information, putting my mind at ease. With many years of experience to his credit, I truly hope to continue doing business with him for many years to come.
