I cannot say enough about the service at Second City Trolley.  From start to finish, I was treated nicer and with more professionalism than any other business I have ever encountered.  They were unbelievably accommodating to my ever-changing RSVP list that I had for the trolley for my boyfriend's birthday.  I did a lot of digging before choosing to go with Second City and I can 100% tell you that they have the absolute best rates in town.  The 30 person trolley that I ended up going with was super clean, heated (I figured that "heated" would mean that it would be about 50 degrees in there...not so, it was comfortable for everyone with their coats off on a really cold night), AND they have Ipod  connectors on board to jam to. :)  The driver was prompt and bent over backwards to make our event the best ever.   I will be recommending this place to anyone that will listen!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!
