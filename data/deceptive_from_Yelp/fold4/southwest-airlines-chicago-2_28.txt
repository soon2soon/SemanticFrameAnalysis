I may still like Southwest, although not as much as I used to. I know I detest the inflight behavior that seems traceable to Air Tran pilots and crews. Air Tran set up their airplanes with inadequate bathroom facilities and then operate to keep the "fasten seat belt/stay in your seat" sign lit for all or most of every flight. Imagine a flight (I don't have to, I was on it) cross-county with 175 people and three bathrooms that are only available for about 1 hour of the five-hour flight. People were in distress all over the cabin with no legitimate way to relieve themselves. Calling a cabin attendant only got the advice that they couldn't authorize it -- you were on your own if you went. Is this a residue of some liability issues? The pilot talked turbulence for hours when there was no evidence of anything shaking in the cabin. The cabin attendants showed no concern for the distress of the passengers, at least not in comparison to their convenience. This behavior (aimed at keeping passengers out of the bathrooms) seems consistent on Air Tran (legacy) flights. On short flights, it is possible to manage even the older bladder to keep from having emergencies, but on the longer flights the discomfort becomes very painful. In the future, only emergencies will get me on booked on any AirTran-run flights.
