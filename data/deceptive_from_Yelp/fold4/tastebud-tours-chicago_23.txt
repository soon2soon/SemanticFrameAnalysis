I recently moved to Chicago and was looking for a way to sample some of the great food I keep hearing about that's made in this city.  Deciding to give Tastebud tours a try, I bought a ticket and went by myself, not really knowing what to expect.  I was really impressed!  The tour surpassed all my expectations.  The guide was knowledgeable and I got way more food than I expected; two kinds of pizza right off the bat!  And it was all delicious, my favorite was the Sugar Bliss cupcake.  After the experience I decided to take the rest of my family on the tour so that they can get the same taste of Chicago (and so that I can snag another cupcake!)
