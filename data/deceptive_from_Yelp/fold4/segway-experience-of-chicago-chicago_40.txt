Despite the chilly weather in Chicago my friends and I had a great time with Segway Experience.  I'm a native of Chicago, but now a suburbanite, and it was nice to see some beautiful lakefront areas for the first time.  Andrew and Casey were professional, friendly and helpful.  Riding a Segway is terrific fun and easy to learn.  I absolutely recommend this company, and hope to take more tours with them
