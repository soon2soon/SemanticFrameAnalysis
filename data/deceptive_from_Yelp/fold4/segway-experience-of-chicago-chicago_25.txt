Just finished the lakefront Segway tour & was veery, very pleased.  Jonathan was our guide, & he was especially good at explaining the various things that could possibly cause us any kind of dangers.    He was very patient with teaching a novice like myself, how to ride one of these vehicles, & within 10-15 minutes, I was riding it like a pro.  They are very easy to ride, & turning is the easiest part!   I saw things along the tour that  I never knew existed, or that I had nevertheless thought about before, & had a great lime, resting my footsies , & letting the Segway do all the work.  I could never have even begun to walk the distances that we traveled, & it was all so easy.  He never went faster than a safe speed for the 3 of us, & I felt perfectly comforatable the speed we took things.  All in all- a thoroughly enjoyable experience, & good practice for when  I take a Segway trip in Washington, DC, LATER IN June!  I will defiantly be back to try another  tour!   2 big thumbs up for a great time!
