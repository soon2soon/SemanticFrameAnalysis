It didn't start out well...the girl that checked us in had a total attitude! She didn't give us any information we had to ask. The guy next to us had a much better agent he was told every detail from filling the gas tank to checking out the car to bringing it back. We then found our way to the garage and were promptly greeted and we were told to pick any car we licked. We picked a brand new mid size SUV with only 300 miles on it. I would have given this 5 stars had it not been for the rude lady that doesn't like her job at the front desk.
