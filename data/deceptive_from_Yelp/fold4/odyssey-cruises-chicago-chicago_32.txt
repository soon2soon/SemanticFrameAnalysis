My mother and I threw a surprise birthday party for my father on the Odyssey, and it was a great choice.  We chose the Sunday night Sunset cruise.  Service was excellent throughout the night, and both the crew and office staff (during the planning stages) were extremely helpful in making sure the party went well.  I highly recommend this cruise, especially if your group has a mix of many different ages.
