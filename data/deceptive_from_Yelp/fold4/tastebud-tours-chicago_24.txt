A group of old college friends and I decided to do something fun and different in the city. I personally don't live in the city, but some of my friends do. We decided to give Tastebud Tours a try as we had been recommended by other friends to give it a try!! We were NOT disappointed. We were in the Loop Tour and had a blast. From Pizano's Pizza to Sugar Bliss--this tour would be hard to top. I could not imagine the amount of food!! Pase yourself!! Such a great time....our Guide was great, food was great, I enjoyed walking after eating...all in all and extraordinary day in the city. We cannot wait to get onto the Michigan Avenue Tour!! Highly would recommend to both locals and visitors of the Chi!! 5 STARS!!
