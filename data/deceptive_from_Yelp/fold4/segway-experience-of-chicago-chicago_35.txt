I purchased groupon for my family so we went on the park tour.  We went by Buckingham Fountain, Field Museum, Soldier Field and by the lakefront.  Our guide Andrew and Casey were great.  They told us many interesting facts about the places we visited and the city.  It didn't take long to learn how to ride the Segway.  We had a great time.  Great fun for kids.  We would definitely do it again!
