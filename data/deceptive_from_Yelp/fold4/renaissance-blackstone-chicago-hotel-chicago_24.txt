OK, I obviously don't have to say much since everyone loves this place already... but just in case somebody is unsure about spending the money to stay here, I would say go for it... splurge.  Of course, I am lucky because my husband is here on a biz trip and his company paid for it, but it is worth it.  I especially loved the midnight ice cream sundaes that my husband let me splurge on since I am preggers. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is accomodating, the bed is luxurious, and the ice cream sundaes are heaven!!!
