I have 2 reviews to do. Good news. Bad news. First the G.N.'s. On a whim my wife and I took a tour with her father, the day before Father's day. from Michigan Ave. The Captain and tour guide were both named Scott. What a great tour. Scott showed us so many details of the buildings that we never knew before. He made two buildings, the Sheraton Hotel, and 225 w. Wacker move, like they were giant steamships. His visual cues were amazing. He also showed us the four tallest buildings in the city, on the river. His dry humor and wit had my father-in -law out of bredth from laughing, which can be hard to do. On his suggestion, we went over to the Tribune building after the tour to see the chunks of the other historic buildings inlaid in the walls. I've lived here all my life, and didn't know that, or many of the other things we saw.I highly recomend his tour. Now the B.N.'s. We took a second cruise last Sunday, and we didn't get the same tour. It was in the middle of the day, and we were on the Voyager. We all liked that there was a bar on it, but the tour was was lacking. The guide must have been having an off day. The only thing I remember is her starting the tour talking about our shoes??? She talked about the buildings,as we were passing them, or right on top of them. It was very confusing. Thank goodness for the bar. It was not a fun as the first one, but there were a lot more people on the second one. Someone should audit the tours. The second one was ok, but nothing like the first. The first tour was well worth the money, the second one, not so much.
