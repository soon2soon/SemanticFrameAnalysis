I've stayed here a half dozen times and keep coming back. I've always Â received gracious service at this flagship Sofitel - and the other properties of this under-celebrated French chain. The hotel's central location, stylish contemporary room design, smart efficient European service staff and civilized [dare I say 'hip'] bar and restaurant make this four star hotel a soothing choice for an often jet lagged globetrotter. I always request [and get] a room on a high floor with a city view facing the lake. The bathrooms are spacious, stylish and generously stocked with all sorts of product. Sofitel's uniquely branded bed/linens are like sleeping on a cloud. Minutes after sliding into bed, I'm in the land of nod. This contemporary French-owned and managed hotel has a modern European flavor and is one of Accor's [parent company] flagships. I often see the Air France crews in the lobby and lounge [lucky them!]
