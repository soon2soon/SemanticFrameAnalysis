I purchased a Groupon for a sail on the WIndy as I thought my dad would enjoy the tall ships.  Becasue of the heat as well as the "no special event" restriction, we chose the 7:15 cruise identified as the "Rumrunner Cruise".  There were 6 of us, including my parents and my ten year old twins. The website said that its cruises were fun for all ages and did not list any warnings about inappropriate content on specific cruises.  At first,  the cruise was kitchy with a gangster holding a tommy gun and a pirate in character outside of the ship for entry.  Once we were on board and motored out of the harbor, people were asked to help with the sails, which my kids thought was fun.   Once the sails were up there was little movement of the ship but the view of the skyline was beautiful.  The highlight of the sail was when the Red Witch ship came by and we "shot" it with a cannon.  Other than that, the bulk of the cruise was, in summary, a history lesson on Prohibition with an emphais on sex and alcohol - how alcohol is in everything that we do and how sex has been used to sell it throughout the times.  Not exactly  what i would market as appropriate for kids of all ages ...  In fact, my daughter turned to me and said that this was not an appropriate cruise for kids, then asking when the lecture would be over.   At the end of the cruise it got very touristy/tacky by 1) bolding identifiying the tip box and letting everyone know that we could put tips in the box on our way out and 2) the $20 picture for sale at the exit. I don't know if the pirate cruises have a lecture on pirates (as opposed to prohibition) or if there is just silliness going on throughout the cruise, but I would have preferred alot more gangster silliness and alot less of a 45 minute lecture about  sex, alcohol and how they are intertwined.
