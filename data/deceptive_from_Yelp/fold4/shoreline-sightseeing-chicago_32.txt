As a tourist, the Shorline Sightseeing Tour was a must. As a host to tourists several years ago, it was my first idea as far as acquainting my guests with the history and attractions of the great city of Chicago. My brother and sister in law decided to come visit because I unfortunately had to miss out on their wedding due to some of my own family things going on. However, they were very forgiving and came out to see us and get a little taste of the city. This tour was absolutely as awesome (if not more) as I remember it being. My brother and his wife loved it, too, so that was extra kudos for the tour and its guide. We also got some inspiration about what to do on several other days of their two week visit-more water tours!!! It was a blast
