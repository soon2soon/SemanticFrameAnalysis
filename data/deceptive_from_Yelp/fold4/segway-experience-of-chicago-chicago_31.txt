LOVED this Segway tour!!  FANTASTIC tour guide (Eric)  who knew A LOT of great detail about the city!!  The equipment was in perfect working order!  We had a great time, and will definitely return and segway tour with them again!  HIGHLY recommend segway-ing to anyone; it is a great way to learn about any city you visit; and so much fun to do!  It's VERY easy to learn, and sure beats walking!! :)  Use this company ~ they are the BEST!!
