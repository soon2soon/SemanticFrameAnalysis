I was bringing in my regional staff for a meeting and wanted to do something different that they may get to see Chicago since many were from out of state. I went looking through different websites and found the Spirit Of Chicago. The website was easy to navigate to obtain information on the interior spaces of the boat, the menu selections and the entertainment. When I called and requested more information for a large party, the staff went out of their way to answer my questions and those I did not know to ask. I knew the night was off to a great start as they took pictures of each other in front of the boat. Upon boarding we were greeted by the crew and shown to our reserved tables. The dining room crew, which also is part of the entertainment were outstanding in their service. The food was served immediately which was well appreciated by all the guests aboard. After a lovely dinner and dessert, the DJ got everyone dancing by playing music that everyone enjoyed. As the cruise came to an end - I received many thanks by my staff for an amazing night of food, fun and the most beautiful view of Chicago skyline. I want to thank everyone on the staff and crew of the Spirit of Chicago for making my meeting a huge success.
