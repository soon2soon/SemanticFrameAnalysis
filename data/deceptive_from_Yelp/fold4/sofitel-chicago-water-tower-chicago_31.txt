I stayed here not too long ago. It was very nice, but for the money and the caliber of hotel it was, there wasn't very much service to go with it. It was very easy to check in, but the staff didn't seen very friendly. Their concierge was pretty good, but very distant. The whole experience was very matter-of-factly. Maybe it's the Midwest in me, but I need some service!
