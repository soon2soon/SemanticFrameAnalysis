What the h$&l?  Paid $30 a person (my mistake - should have at least looked for a Groupon or Living Social for discounted coupons) to take my family when they were in for a visit. We've all done a lot of architecture boat tours along the river and wanted to do something different. We thought a cruise in the early evening in the lake would be nice, even better in a beautiful sailboat as opposed to the generic tourist boats. We booked the 5:45 architecture trip (I'm on it still and so bored in writing the yelp review now.). I expected to be cruising along the lakefront getting a tour of the skyline. Instead we've sat in the middle of the inner harbor for 45 minutes just bobbing around and now we're turning around heading back to the pier. What a freakin waste of money!!  Meanwhile the 'architectural' tour is the pirate from the earlier tour standing on the lower deck telling stories. No microphone for anyone up on the upper decks to actually hear. Hands down the worst thing I have ever done in Chicago (and I grew up here). Thank goodness our skyline is beautiful or I might have thrown myself overboard.
