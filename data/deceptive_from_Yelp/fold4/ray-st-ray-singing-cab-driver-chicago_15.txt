Once I got into the cab, I noticed three things almost immediately: 1) the unexpected cleanliness of the cab, 2) the driver was wearing a pin striped suit similar to one worn by Colonel Sanders, and did, in fact, have a mustache and 3) he was eating a sandwich. All of the factors made me apprehensive off the bat but I gave him my destination anyways. As soon as Ray asked me which topic of song I would most enjoy, I immediately starting checking the doors for any Bone Collector-like "re-modeling" of the locks and mentally noted the cab number. Unfortunately, after a rainy day spent watching Law and Order episodes, my mind immediately envisioned the worst which was only exacerbated once he requested that I turn off my phone and any other recording devices I may have on my person. Once he started singing, he was utterly delightful. I could not, however, get over the visual of him humming the same melancholy tune to himself as he sliced my body over a cold, metal table in a deserted warehouse somewhere in the city limits (again, thanks USA channel). After reaching my destination safely and quickly, however, I was smitten. His songs are original, witty and fun and Ray provided a ride I certainly have not and will not forget. He has been driving the cab for 20 years and has been singing and entertaining the public with his performance art for just as long. Look out for a white van cab which according to the Maestro, runs generally between the hours of 6am and 6pm and don't waste your time imagining your gruesome demise as I did. Enjoy the ride.
