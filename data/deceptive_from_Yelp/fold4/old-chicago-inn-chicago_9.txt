I've stayed here twice in the past few years, and while the place is OK, on the high side of reasonably priced (for Chicago) and well-situated, they could still do a much better job.  Now I remember why I didn't love it the first time.  As other reviewers have noted, the dim lighting, slightly sterile, dingy feel to the place and inconveniences like a lack of coat hooks in the rooms are inexcusable.  And no reading light by the bed? C'mon people.  That's Hospitality 101 stuff.  I found the "breakfast" part of the deal weak too. The hotelkeeper David was perfectly nice and attentive, but I get the sense the absentee owners are just milking their investment and not really interested in kicking it up a notch.  So this "inn" shouldn't be your first choice.  Too bad.
