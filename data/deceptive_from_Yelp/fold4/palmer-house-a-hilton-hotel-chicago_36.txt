WORST HOTEL EVER!!! It was fine until the day we left when the people who had a con joining room had $400 stolen from the BOTTOM of their suitcase underneath dirty clothes and the zipper was halfway zipped when they left it unzipped in the first place and we had thought we lost our room key but we had checked every single drawer bag, suitcase, garbage, EVERYTHING for it and we could not find it. And as we called security and he was at our door a cleaning lady Came up and said she had cleaned our room where I was in the room earlier by myself and a different lady came in wanting to clean Â and apparently the same lady cleans our rooms everyday. Lesson Learned: even if you think its a nice hotel, its not. NEVER STAY HERE
