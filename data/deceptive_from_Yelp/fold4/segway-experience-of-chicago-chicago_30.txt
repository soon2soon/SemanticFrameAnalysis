We had a wonderful time with our skating group.  We had so much fun they are still talking about it!!!  The tour guides were knowledgeable and really really so  nice to our large group.  They took us to beautiful spots along the way and happily helped take fabulous photos.  We all want to go back next year.  Highly recommended.
