Everything about this property is excellent. The staff at the front (bellmen and front desk) are very attentive and helpful. The hotel sits far enough off both roads so it seems a little more quiet. The decor is nice as the property balances their history and elegance of their property but not making the guestrooms to over the top and traditional. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
