Awesome experience!!!  My husband and I had booked our travel to Brazil and went down to the Chicago Consulate only to be told they are no longer processing tourist visas.  We contacted a few services that were very pricey and they still could not guarantee our visa would be processed due to issues with Chicago and the storms on the East Coast.  We contacted Swift Passport Services and were immediately surprised.  We had excellent service from the onset, a very easy transition of documentation and our visa was in hand 4 days before they told us it would be!  I would recommend this company to anyone and will definitely be using them again!
