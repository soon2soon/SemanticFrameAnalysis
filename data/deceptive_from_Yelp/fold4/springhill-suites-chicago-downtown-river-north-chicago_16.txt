We used SpringHill Suites for our wedding block hotel.  It was the most reasonably priced hotel in River North for the amount of space you get.  It was clean and the staff was polite.  I was originally put in a room overlooking a construction site, but I asked for a different room, and they moved me.  It's not super fancy, but it is modern, comfortable, and conveniently located.  They did a good job.
