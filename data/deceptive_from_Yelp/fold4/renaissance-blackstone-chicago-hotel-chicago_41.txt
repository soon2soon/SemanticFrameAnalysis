I stayed here for more than 30 days. I loved this place.Friendly staff and atmosphere.  Very clean and Very good service.They have free drinks and snacks in the evening but only for Medallion members.Lake view and Millennium park view  from my room was simply Beautiful. I was staying on 15th flr. They rent bike for free, limited availability so first come first serve. Only lacking point is they don't serve free breakfast. They have good Spanish restaurant but very expensive. Best in south-loop.Cheers..
