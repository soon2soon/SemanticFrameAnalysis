I loved staying here and last Christmas season, I've booked 2 rooms for me and my folks to celebrate Christmas. My home is a dump, haha, and I can afford it. What is Christmas if it's gonna be spent cramped in a dump or away from your family. Here I decided to have the best of both worlds. Spacious rooms, beautiful views, restaurants and places and events to have fun. In house food is great, too and service and staff, facilities are excellent. I really couldn't think of anywhere else to spend because anything else is not nice enough or too far away. This place will be the rendezvous point for my folks and a special place to spend during Chriistmas.
