I recently booked two hotel rooms; (1) King Studio and (1) One-bedroom Suite at the Residence Inn-Downtown River North. Upon check in, we found the hotel to be very clean and accommodating. I have always stayed at the Residence Inn on Walden when in Chicago, and although I like the Walden address better for shopping purposes, I am equally impressed with the River North facility for its proximity to restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. Our party was most impressed with the friendliness of the RI staff from the front desk to housekeeping to the morning gal that made the waffles. Very impressive, indeed. The staff should be commended. I did think, however, that the $54 charge for valet parking was a bit high, but you know what they say, when in Rome ...
