Gary D Having an urgent need to get a pasport I contacted Swift from their website. They were extremely helpful and walked through all the steps to expedite. handled every thing over the phone and through FedEx with no need to appear in person. everything was handled perfectly and they contacted me promptly when the passport office put a one day hold on my application. They deliver on their promise and would highly recommend their service to anyone who need passports on very short notice. excellent service!!
