National at Midway provided excellent service. I was greeted with a smile at the counter and in the parking garage. My car was clean and on great shape. Upon returning my car, I was completely at fault for cutting it close (returned my car with about 35 mins until my flight was to take off). The employee printing my receipt asked her manager if an employee could just drive me to departures instead of taking the shuttle. I didn't even ask for this favor, but am so glad that I did and I was able to make my flight. I will always rent with National.
