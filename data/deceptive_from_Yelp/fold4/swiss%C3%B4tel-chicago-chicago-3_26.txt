Beautiful hotel but vallet service was a nightmare! Whoever parked my car re programed ALL 6 of my radio stations to mexican stations! When I called the manager about this issue, he told me the employee must have by accident hit a button! Really?? He didnt even apologize! Learned my lesson about vallet services...
