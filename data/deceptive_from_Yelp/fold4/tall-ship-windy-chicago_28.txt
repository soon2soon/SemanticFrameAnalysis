My husband and I took the Tall Ship Windy Fireworks Cruise when we vacationed in Chicago July 2014.  For 70+ dollars for the two of us I definitely say, NOT WORTH IT.  Seeing the fireworks in front of the Chicago skyline from the water was definitely cool, however not worth the money and the 1.5 hour "boat ride."  The only neat part was the 10 minutes of fireworks and after that we really wanted off the boat.  I would think you could see the fireworks from other cool locations in the city and not have to spend 70+ bucks.  The worst part of our ride was the captain.  He was extremely rude to the guests on the boat.  The other staff on the boat made announcements not to use flash photography because it messes with the captain's vision.  Of course you have people who don't follow the rules or know how to turn the flash off on their camera phones so flashes were going off left and right.  The captain started yelling about it and was rather rude considering everyone was a paying customer.  "Do you want me to be blind?"   "Yeah, that's smart, put a flash in your captains eyes!"  I was honestly shocked at the things he was saying at a volume where everyone could hear.  Very cranky older man with a beard.  I think it's time he retire or stop doing the late night cruise; maybe it was past his bedtime.  The pirate aspect of this is lame as well.  There was one man dressed as a pirate who told ghost stories while we sat in still water for 20 minutes after the fireworks.  Frankly, my husband and I were bored.  It seemed it could have been entertaining to middle school kids so maybe give it a try if you're vacationing with your pre-teens.  Other than that - I recommend saving your money and trying to see the fireworks from another cool spot in the city.
