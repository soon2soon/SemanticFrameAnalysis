I have never written a review for anything, and I am not one to complain but when you pay top dollar for a great hotel experience and it is the exact opposite I just have to speak up. There were about 5 bell hops standing outside when we pulled up, who did not even move a finger when my husband and I showed up with our dog and 3 pieces of luggage. Â We had to struggle to open the door ourselves while they just looked at us. Very disappointed with their service considering they are a 4 star hotel and claim, "service matters most".
