I took a girl scout troop with girls ages 12 and 13 to the Stray Boots scavenger hunt at Navy Pier.   We divided them into teams and let them run the hunt themselves.   They had a wonderful time with finding the answers and sending texts and photos and of course, competing with each other.   The parents and I liked it because the activities were safe yet interesting.    The girls really loved it and are already asking about doing the Magnificent Mile scavenger hunt.
