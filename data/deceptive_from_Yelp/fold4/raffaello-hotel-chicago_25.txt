Living Social had a $99/night deal.  I called the hotel, asked for a room, they said it was available and asked how I'd like to pay.  I told them I had the Living Social deal and then the room was suddenly and magically unavailable.  The date I wanted was NOT on the blacked-out date list and the fine print only said "subject to availability".  The funny part was, they just told me a room was indeed available.  Living Social refunded my purchase but I will NEVER STAY HERE because they are liars.
