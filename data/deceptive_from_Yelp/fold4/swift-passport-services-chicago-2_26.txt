I am a seasoned traveler and was very careful to get my passport renewed and a Brazil visa in plenty of time for my trip.  A few weeks before my tripped I moved and somehow lost my passport.  Being that it took me 6 weeks to get a passport and visa I thought for sure I was out of luck and that I would have to cancel my trip.  A friend who had used Swift passport gave me their phone number.  I called not thinking they would be able to help. The people at Swift walked me through what I needed to do and got me a new passport and Brazil visa in 6 days.  I cant believe they pulled it off and the entire experience was wonderful.  This is my first yelp and I am doing it because the customer service was so ridiculously good that I feel it should be recognized.  I imagine sending your personal docs to somebody could be a scary thing but I was immediately put at ease when talking to the professional staff at Swift Passport.  These people are good- we were fast friends. They made it so easy!   Its hard to find people who treat you this good in the service industry.  Rob and Amber- thanks so much, keep an eye out for a post card from Brazil!
