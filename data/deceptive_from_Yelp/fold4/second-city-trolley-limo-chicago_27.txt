I booked a trolley about a month ago for my birthday. The driver was great, he even picked up ice for the trolley cooler before he met us at the first bar. Fast forward a couple of hours and the trolley completely dies in the middle of the street. The driver calls it in and after 5-10 minutes of figuring things out tells me they can send another one. At this point everyone has left the trolley as they don't want to sit on a broken down bus in the middle of the street when it's 25 degrees out hoping for another one to show up. I'm the only one on the trolley at this point so I toss the driver a tip and take off as well. I called the office and explained what happened. I wasn't angry or confrontational at all, I just wanted to see if they'd be willing to refund me for the time lost on the trolley. They remembered the incident and said to call back the next day. I did, a couple of times, and no one answered. I left a message to call me back and nobody did. If you're not going to compensate a customer in some fashion because your trolley broke down, there's not much I can do about that. At this point, it's not even about that. Ducking an unsatisfied customer who's attempting to contact you is really poor customer service. It left a very bad taste in my mouth with regards to this company. As a preemptive response to the representative that will say "you should have just waited for another trolley to arrive," when I'm paying $200+/hour for your service, that shouldn't entail waiting on a broken down trolley in the middle of the street for 20 minutes. Malfunctions happen, I completely understand, but stand by your product and make it right if they do.
