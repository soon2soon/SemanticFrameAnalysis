Beautiful hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. At the north end of The Mile, which is so convenient for shopping. We had a wonderful breakfast each morning at the restaurant in the lobby. Overpriced (as is everything in Chicago), but good food. The negatives: I was promised a superior room which meant a larger room with a view and free wi-fi. That didn't happen. I wanted to print out our boarding passes, but the cost to access a computer and printer was ridiculous. The closet in our room was broken; one door was broken and resting on the shelf inside of the closet. You'd think a maid would notice and report something like that. HATED the shower. There are directions listed on the shower wall, which was the first clue. The shower head is so far away that the entire shower is one freezing experience. In order to properly rinse, you have to switch from shower head to wand, so you get to stand there freezing. I would probably stay here again, though only for a short visit. The room cost was pricey (but, again, so are all of the rooms on The Mile).
