Wow! We took 329 students, teachers and parents for the buffet lunch cruise.  We have taken this end of the school year trip for 10 consecutive years.  Each and every year, the staff is always  attentive, polite and  talk about crowd management; the DJ is fantastic. The entire cruise is student centered and the proof is that our students can't stop talking about their experience and parents are very complementary!
