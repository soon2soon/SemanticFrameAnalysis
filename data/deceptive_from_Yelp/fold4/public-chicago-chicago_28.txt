This was the old ambassador east with complete remodel. Designer went for 'minimal' and it is!  It looks like they bought a bed at Ikea and threw it in the room and shut the door!   There is no art on white walls, no quilt! Even worse, amenities are minimal! No robe, no make-up mirror, no conditioner,no alarm clock or radio and only 2 bath towels. Also broken faucet, clothes hook, night table light, desk light! There is no coffee pot and we were told continental breakfast was included but it was not and a latte was $9.00.  We have stayed in high quality hotels all over the world and we have never disliked a room so much. Anyone who gives this hotel a high rating is comparing to motel 6! Only plus is that it is clean and in a great location. When we return to Chicago we will go back to the Sutton Place which is reopening in October as the Thompson.
