I learned about Sunset-Travel through a prior review on yelp.  I wanted to plan a surprise trip to USVI for my partner and I this winter, after speaking with Ryan I geve him a list of what I was looking for in a resort and what type of weekend I wanted to have, and my budget.  I then basically told him to find me what he could and present them to me and I would decide from there, since I was out of town when I initieated this I have yet to meet face to face with him, however he presented me with a plethora of options, I think there were 8, and we discussed over the phone and via e-mail what would be the best choice.  So far he has been excellent in helping me plan this trip. While I don't leave for the trip for another two weeks, I definately wanted to put the word out there that Sunset Travel on Fullerton rocks, I appreciate all Ryan has done, he as been patient and was up for the challenge.  I will post another review once my partner and I get back from our trip to Playa del Carmen!
