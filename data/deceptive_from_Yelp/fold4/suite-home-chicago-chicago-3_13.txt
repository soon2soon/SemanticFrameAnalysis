Our family stayed at The Coast on E. Wacker. The view was breathtaking form the balcony on the 43rd floor. We had a corner apartment with full windows that provided an amazing view of the city from one side and Lake Michigan from the other capturing Navy Pier as well. Spacious, very clean, comfortable beds especially the master bedroom's king size bed. Black out drapes in the master bedroom as well. 24 hour security, workout facility, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, business center and lounge with a kitchen made our stay feel like we were at a luxurious resort. We are already looking forward to our next stay. Thank you Suite Home Chicago!
