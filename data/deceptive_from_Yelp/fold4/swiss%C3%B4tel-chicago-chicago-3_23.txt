If you like bugs, this is the spot to be!  I saw some kind of bugs crawling across my bed in the middle of the night and had bites on my arms the next morning when I stayed here last week and would never stay here again!  Gross gross gross!   I think there's plenty of other places to stay in Chicago that do not have bed bugs! Beware if you stay here of what you may be in for!  Bed bugs.  NO THANKS!  This hotel is a joke.
