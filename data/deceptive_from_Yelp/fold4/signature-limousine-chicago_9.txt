I had the pleasure of doing business with Signature Limousine at a time when it was very difficult to get transportation from David M's concert. Not ,only that I was able to secure a car on an hour's notice but the rate was excellent considering the fact that everyone was overcharging and trying to make as much money from this event as possible. The car was clean, the driver Alex was professional and respectful! Not to mention the fact that the operator confirmed my reservation immediately , via email. I recommend this company. without any reservations!
