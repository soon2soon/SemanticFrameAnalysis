12/8 - 12/15/14, Newark to New Orleans. First time with Southwest, won't be the last. R/T was $192. Our dates were flexible, web site made it easy to select the cheapest fares. Seats and legroom were fine, I'm 6 ft. with long legs. Check in online 24 hours before scheduled departure for earlier boarding. Passes can be printed at the airport. We expected much worse given the low fare but were very happily surprised. Very nice job, SW!
