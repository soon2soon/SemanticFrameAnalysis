Swift Passport was able to get my passport quickly by taking the steps I would have had to do through the government but taking the waiting of 6-8 weeks out of the process. They were also very easy to communicate with every step of the way so I knew when I would be receiving my passport, unlike the government where they were only able to estimate with in a 2 week period. I have and will continue to refer friends and family to Swift Passport for the ease of obtaining travel documents.
