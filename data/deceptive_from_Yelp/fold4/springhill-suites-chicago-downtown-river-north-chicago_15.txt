What a great hotel! Firstly it is located in a convenient location, with restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance. If you're looking to buy groceries, go to the nearby Trader Joe's. It has a great selection at pretty reasonable prices. The transit station is quite near too. If you're coming in from the O'hare airport, you can catch the train directly to Clark/Lake and walk from there. The rooms look great and are very clean. The beds are pretty comfortable too! Cleaning staff are efficient too! Oh yes, and there's a pool and spa at the top level! Great for relaxation. Oh! and Free Wifi!! They offer free breakfast. It's pretty good with a selection of fruit, sausages and eggs, muffins, cereals and spreads but ends pretty early from memory (9am?). Watch out for the lady at breakfast, she's such a character and helped me make waffles for breakfast (Yes, they have a waffle machine!). Overall...it's wonderful!
