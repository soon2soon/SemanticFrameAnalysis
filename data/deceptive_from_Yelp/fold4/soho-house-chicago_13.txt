I was a regular at the Soho House in NYC and loved it so I was thrilled to see one opening in Chicago. I've been a few times now and it's so very disappointing. It's beautifuly designed but the staff and service were really awful. And based on the other reviews I'm not alone in my bad experiences. There realy isn't much to say other than I won't be back, I'll save my Soho House visits for NYC. . .
