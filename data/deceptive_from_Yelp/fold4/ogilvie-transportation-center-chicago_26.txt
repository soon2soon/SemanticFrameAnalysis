I commute here for work four days a week currently. Before I got this job, however, I was still using this station for my little weekend dates with the missus (she lives downtown, I lived in the suburbs). I've always loved this place. First off, it's amazingly simple to get around. Two levels with a ton of wide open space. All you have to do is keep going straight and you're at your track. Traffic gets hectic around rush hour, but its never unbearable (I've only had one complaint about the crowd, and that was a Saturday after a bears game). There's a lot to do that a lot of the other reviews covered so I won't get into it. Just gonna say there's a lot of options in terms of food and shopping for a train station (Pizza Hut and Waldenbooks are closed as of this writing, however). Be wary of Hudson News though, they're extremely overpriced. If you've got the time, go outside and to the east (left) a block to CVS to get your fix. It's very easy to get to the CTA from here. There are bus stops right outside the station and the nearest El station is a five minute walk east across the river. Two massive boards display your departure times, as well as about a half dozen TV screens littered around the place. And to the people who say there's no clock, did you not catch the giant three-faced one at the top of the escalator? Only complaint is the ticket counter. Buy them online or set aside some time. You'll get lucky most of the time, but it's not uncommon to see massive backed up lines. Still better than Union, but still a pain in the butt. Oh, and the bathrooms can be disgusting. But the rest of the station is quite clean. Thumbs up!
