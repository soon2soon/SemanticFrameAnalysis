I travel frequently for work so I see (and live in) a lot of hotels. I opted for the Sofitel when I found out that my regular hotel on Michigan Ave was booked out due to a conference...and it turned out to be a good thing too! Sofitel is now my 'go to' hotel when work takes me to Chicago. It is a fairly new hotel and the uber chic lobby speaks to its newness. The receptionist put me in a room on the 7th floor. When I mentioned that I had stayed at the Sofitel in LA and in the SF Bay area and hinted at a desire for a room on a higher floor, he happily moved me to one on the 37th floor with a view of the Lake. Later that evening when he saw me in the lobby he asked me if I liked the room. I like that kind of simple attention. Given the frequency of my travel, here are a few things I look for in a good hotel: 1) 24 hr gym, 2) Food easily available at odd hours of the day or night 3) Good wireless internet that can keep my VPN going 4) Comfortable work desk set up 5) In room locker 6) Comfortable bed and pillows. On most of these counts the Sofitel scored easily. I have to add that it has one of the better hotel gyms I have used. I don't care much for fancy bathrooms but the Sofitel made it a winning point. It was as large as (if not larger than) my room and tastefully done. For a big city/prime location hotel, it sets the norm in this area. All in all, it's a hotel I would highly recommend.
