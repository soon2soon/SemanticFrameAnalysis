My husband and I recently completed a two-month stay at a Ryan Corporate rental unit in Chicago. Everything about our experience exceeded our expectations. The apartment was well appointed from both an aesthetic and a practical standpoint. Upon move-in Ryan told us to let him know if there was anything else that we might need. We sent him a list of a few really minor things and the next day everything on our list was taken care of. Their customer service was the highest quality at every interaction. There were no surprises. We couldn't have been happier with our choice and would make the same one again in a heartbeat! Kudos to Ryan for the organization he's built. Â You can be assured that if you rent from Ryan Corporate Housing you will experience the very best!
