I reserved a Mother's Day brunch cruise. It was a lot of fun. The two hour cruise had Â buffet style, a DJ playing top 40 hits/ mixing it up with some old school, but the most exciting part was going out onto the observation deck for the spectacular views. My family and I had a great time. I would definitely go back to the Spirit of Chicago again.
