I was in charge of planning my girlfriends bachlorette party and to get a limo for 12 other girls.  I booked my reservation for the 14 person stretch limo in there fleet.  The driver showed up 15 minutes early and was very funny, yet professional.  He took us to a place in Naperville called Sattle Up and even though are pick up time was scheduled for 2AM he said feel free to call him at the number he provided on his business card if we wanted to go to another club/bar or if we just wanted to get picked up earlier.  The limo was very spacious and up to date with cool lights and a input for my IPod.  It was also very clean inside and out.  Thanks for making our bride to be so happy and getting us home safe.
