We stayed at the Drake as we were in town for a wedding. The hotel is very nice and the staff was very accommodating. As a diamond member with Hilton, we were upgraded to a suite on the executive floor. The executive lounge is awesome. They serve you free breakfast and offer drinks, snacks, and beverages each night. We used valet for our car and the attendants were very nice. Ask for a room with a water view.
