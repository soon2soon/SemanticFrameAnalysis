This hotel is overrated. It is in a nice location. However, they do not do well with handling large groups, i.e. conferences, conventions, etc. I was there this past July and upon check in the room was dirty. There was a band aid in the shower, all kinds of trash behind and under the furniture and the outlets didn't work. I called to complain and after a lengthy wait a bellhop brings a key to another room. Not once did he even offer to help move our things. Later I called for an iron because the one in the room didn't work. I didn't get it until the next day after calling several more times. The wait for elevators was 15+ minutes at times. I will not be staying here again...beware!! Also, even though this is typical for the city I presume, the parking fee was OUTRAGEOUS! We ended up using the garage at the condos next door for half the price.
