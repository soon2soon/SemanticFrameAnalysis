We used Prime Time Limo for our wedding and had the best experience. Pat showed up early, loaded the limo with all the extras we needed for the reception hall and had lots of water for the bridal party. We had a small issue of being able to cross a bridge safely in such a long vehicle when we arrived at the venue and Pat handled it with such patience and grace. He then delivered the Groom's grandfather and friend safely and comfortably. Prime Time Limo also picked up and dropped guests before and after the wedding date to the airports. Everyone arrived on time. We have used this limo service in the past for rides to the airport and have never had a problem. The cars are clean, the drivers prompt and very courteous.
