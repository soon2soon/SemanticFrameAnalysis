My wife and I were very concerned about getting to go on a vacation we had booked long before we knew a baby was on the way. When we found out the baby was due within weeks of our departure date we began searching for a company that could help us get our passport problem taken care of without costing a fortune. We were impressed with the level of detailed ongoing service the staff at SPS provided. They prepared us for all the doc's we would need to obtain/ create and stayed in constant personal contact with us through every step along the way. They even tracked our overnight package and took care of a problem that occurred when our documents were en route. For the cost and detailed level of service were were amazed at how easy they made this process. I have recommended them to everyone in my family and our close friends.
