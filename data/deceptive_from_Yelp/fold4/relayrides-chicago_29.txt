Great service and really easy to use. It's much cheaper than other car sharing services and makes a lot of sense. The only negative is that sometimes the car owners can take a bit of time to respond and so if you need a car on short notice it sometimes doesn't work out well. Although there are also "instant access" cars that allow you to rent instantly but there are not very many in Chicago. I'd still fully recommend and I plan to continue using the service.
