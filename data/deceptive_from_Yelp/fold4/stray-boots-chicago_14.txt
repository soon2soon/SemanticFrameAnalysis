We really enjoyed our tour in the Loop through Stray Boots.  The smart phone app couldn't have been easier to use.  The clues were fun and ranged from super easy to a little challenging so we didn't get bored or frustrated.  More than once we were amazed at the tidbits of information that we learned after solving a clue.  And we visited places we never even knew existed in Chicago.  We loved this tour and will definitely be doing some of the others.
