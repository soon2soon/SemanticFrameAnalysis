Dear Millennium Knickerbocker hotel:  I really enjoyed my stay at your hotel last weekend.  Your location is great, the price we paid was reasonable and your hotel is very nice looking.  While the king size room was a little small, that's not surprising for an older hotel in the city.  Everyone was friendly and helpful. I guess I should be impressed that your housekeeping staff is so happy but the joyous whistling at 8am outside my door was a bit much.  It went on for about 20 minutes while the cleaning carts were loaded and woke up at least two rooms worth of people.  I'm sure there were more people also but I didn't get a chance to talk to any other neighbors about their take on the serenade. Also, the housekeeper walking around later in the day with the walkie-talkie turned up to 11 seemed a little extreme.  We heard her coming before we even saw her and had to stop talking until she passed because she was so loud we couldn't hear each other.   Overall, I love the hotel but a little better bed-side manner by the cleaning staff on floor 9 would be appreciated.
