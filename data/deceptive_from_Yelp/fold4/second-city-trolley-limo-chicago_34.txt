A thousand thanks to Second City Trolley /Limo. What a great service. We had a few hours to fill between the wedding and the reception. The driver got us out to the lake for pictures and then got us to our destination on time on one of the worst traffic days in the City of Chicago. I would highly recommend Second City Trolley. The Sister says" Thanks Doug and Tom".
