I took the architectural tour on 08/27/14 later in the afternoon.  The weather was perfect.  Sarah, our tour guide was fantastic.  I really enjoyed seeing more of the city than I would have been able to on foot.  The information Sarah provided was interesting.  It was amazing how fast the tour went by.  She was entertaining and engaging.  I would recommend the tour and if you have the chance, make sure Sarah is your guide.
