Wow ....that is the only thing i can say! let me tell you i came the first time and saw the boats at Navy Pier and me one of the employees who was handing out fliers. now let me describe this encounter..In the heat of the day and it was hot my family and i hear this man screaming out like a barker (get it seadog barker hahaha) but he was ryhming and calling everyones attention to boatrides for the Seadog..it was halarious so when we approached him he began telling us all about the tours.I noticed immediately it was like he was more excited telling us about it than i have ever seen in any employee anywhere it was amazing. We decided right there to get tickets and take your extreme ride..And to our surprise he was even our guide on that ride. He had an unending amount of energy and was funny as well as very personable and we loved it, so much that we came back the second day for the river tour and he was our guide again on that tour!!!I was amazed with his knowledge and they way he enjuoyed the customers as much as we all enjoyed him. I think his name was Trooper,and what a Trooper he was. Thank you Seadog and Trooper for being such great people and great fun i cant wait to visit Chicago again.
