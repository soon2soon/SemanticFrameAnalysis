I've stayed here twice, and both times I was told that my room would have something that I specifically asked for--and it didn't. The manager seemed to care and apologized and tried to make things better, but since the hotel was fully booked, there wasn't much she was able to do. As an individual that stays at hotels a lot in Chicago, this property would be on the low list of mine.
