My husband and I went on the tour.  We had a great time.  We have never done a food tour and wasn't sure what to expect.  Lynn our tour guide was friendly and very interesting to listen to.  He knew a lot about the area and provided some history on the tour.  It was a fun day and would recommend doing the tour.  We wouldn't have gone to most of restaurants on our own, so this gave us some places to go back to when we visit Chicago again.  The food we had was plenty for us.  I couldn't have eaten anymore and was glad to be done at our last stop.
