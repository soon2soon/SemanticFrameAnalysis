Took open water diver pool and classroom sessions with Rami and Kit.  Both were very safety-oriented while still keeping it fun.  Rami did an excellent job of expanding on the required PADI material to include real-world scenarios.  Had plenty of classroom time and pool time to prepare for the open water dives.  Open water dives were a breeze after training at Scuba Sensations.
