We took the Lincoln Park tour, us two 'Seniors'. had a great time, explored an area of Chicago we had not been to for prob 20 years. Felt like we were on "the Amazing Race'. We did not compete, just enjoyed the game. Went into the park, residential areas and businesses. Had problem finding one spot, but if it was too obvious, it wouldn't have been an adventure!
