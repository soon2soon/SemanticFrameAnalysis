Even as a South Asian and Chicago resident who knows Devon Avenue very well, I learned new things and discovered some new places I'll definitely revisit. It made me see the neighborhood with different eyes. The tour guide is clearly an expert on this gem of a Chicago neighborhood and takes you to the best places. Hit him up for insider tips for places not on the tour too! Just one piece of advice: Come Hungry!! Â You'll get a good sampling of all the regions and there are options for vegetarian, gluten-free, and meat eaters.
