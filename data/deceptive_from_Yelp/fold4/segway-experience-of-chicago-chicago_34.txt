I've lived in Chicago since 2006 and I always wanted to go on a Segway tour of the city.  Let me tell you that this company is phenomenal!  We had Ryan as our tour guide and he is a fantastic orator.  His knowledge of the city was very impressive!  We had five people in our group and each person individually had a wonderful time.  It started to rain toward the end of the trip but it didn't dampen our experience.  The taste of Chicago was going on but under no circumstances did we feel short changed.  Ryan did an amazing job circumventing the park system and gave us fun facts at every stopping point.  Let me tell you if you go on a Segway in Chicago choose this company!
