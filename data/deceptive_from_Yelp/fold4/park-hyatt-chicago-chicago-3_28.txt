My mom and I stayed at the Park Hyatt in Chicago when we visited recently for my twenty-first birthday.  We normally would not be able to afford a hotel like this, but mom cashed in her credit card points to get us a room.  After our stay, I can say that I will be saving up my money so I can come back! This hotel is UNBELIEVABLE.  Everything is spotless.  The lobby is large, spacious, and looks more like an art gallery than a hotel.  The staff was incredibly helpful and courteous at all times.  The regular doorman, the concierge (Jen, who gladly helped us out with everything during our stay), and the man at the front desk who checked us in all remembered that we were there for my birthday and asked how it was the next day.   We stayed in a room with two double beds with a view of the water tower.  The room was by far the nicest I have ever stayed in.  The beds were unbelievably comfortable, the bathroom looked like it belonged in the home of a millionaire, and there was a huge window seat where my mom and I spent plenty of time enjoying the view and people-watching.  Every night, our sheets were turned down for us, and a glass and bottle of water appeared on our nightstands.   I don't know what else to say about this hotel except that it was an amazingly luxurious experience.  I felt pampered and special during my stay.  They have earned a returning customer if I can save up enough to stay there again!
