My best friend and I choose to meet each other in Chicago for four days.  We thoroughly researched all the hotels in the Chicago area.  We both felt that the Omni gave us the best bang for our buck. We booked the hotel and were able to obtain a fantastic package deal.  We received $25.00 a day per person dining vouchers as well as free valet ( usually $50 per day). We used the dining vouchers every morning for breakfast--it was excellent.  One night, after shopping all day, we ordered room service. The food was very good. Room service staff was courteous and very prompt.  Each night our ice bucket was filled along with turn down service.  The staff were always polite and engaged you in conversation.  The valet staff was outstanding.  They were very polite and always made sure that they opened  doors for us. One night it rained and two valet employees each used an umbrella to make sure that we did not get wet getting into our car.   Our main complaint is that the corner suites appear to be large and spacious in the promos for the hotel.  I think the pictures were taken with a wide angle lens.  In reality, the room were extremely small for two people.  Secondly, if you are sleeping in the fold out bed, you need to have a coffee table that is not made out of chrome and glass and weighs a ton to move!  Another suggestion is that the glass partition between the bedroom and the living room makes it difficult for the party in either room to sleep if someone is reading with the light on in the other room as the light shines through the door. The bathtub should have a bathmat for use or there should be sanded strips placed on the bottom of the tub. I felt very unsteady on my feet so I used a towel every morning to make sure I did not fall.  I probably could have asked housekeeping if they had a bath mat, but I kept forgetting. As you usually spend minimal time in the room, we would definitely return to the Omni.
