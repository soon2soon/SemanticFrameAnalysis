I used this scavenger hunt as part of a week-long summer school that I teach every year.  I had 5 students that were 10 and 11 years old.  We really had a great time and I especially enjoyed the fact that the questions were off the beaten track.  I've lived in Chicago most of my life and didn't want to be learning the same information I already knew.  The kids enjoyed waiting to see if their answers were correct and what the next question would be.  This activity added a lot to our class, in which we focus on the history and architecture of the downtown area.  The kids know that the class is a learning activity, and they have the mindset of being ready for investigation and exploration.  The scavenger hunt experience added an element of fun, while still focusing on some learning.  I'll definitely do this again.
