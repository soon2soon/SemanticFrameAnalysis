OMG! We could NEVER stay anywhere else when we go to Chicago again! Your staff took such good care of us. We came for almost a week and were married while we were there. Everyone was so over the top helpful, wonderful and it was like family! We could not even truly begin to thank the staff there from Nikki (the manager), Erica (our waitress), Svetlana (front desk) to the hotel driver for what an amazing experience they provided to us. Thank you for making our stay and our very special Wedding day such a wonderful over the top experience!
