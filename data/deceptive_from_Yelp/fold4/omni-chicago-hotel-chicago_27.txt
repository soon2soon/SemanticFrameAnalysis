We stayed April 2014, as a family.  We asked for adjoining rooms due to children. We were told to arrive early to get adjoining rooms.   Arrived at 8:00 AM.    NO adjoining rooms.   Also at a cost of $313.00 per room, per night, NO free wifi.    REALLY?   $626.00, plus $65 to park our car, and no wifi!? Per another review, they received free coffee, tea, juice, red bull,  Wifi?   We were not offered any of these. I'm sure all the other guest were very please with the children in our group running up/down/across the hall due to adjoin room issue. The staff were amazing! The rooms were clean! Location, perfect!
