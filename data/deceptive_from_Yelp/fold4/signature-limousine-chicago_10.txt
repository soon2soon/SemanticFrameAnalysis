Although I read the negative comments before booking with Signature I did book a trip to the United Center for a Blackhawk's game.  They were outstanding!  No problems like the other people had.  They were excellent in customer service and the driver arrived earlier and was pleasant.  Nour was very helpful and so was Irena.  I would definitely recommend this company.
