The Old Chicago Inn is a European style Bed and Breakfast with an emphasis on hospitality from the staff. The rooms are small and the facilities old, but it's comfortable, clean, and safe. The bed included a snugly warm down duvet to ward off the cold rainy night! The plush robes for guests really were, the free Wi-Fi was fast, a complementary membership to a nearby gym (which I didn't use) was included, and breakfast was served until 11 a.m. with coffee, juice, milk, cereal, and delicious fresh baked pastries. Trader Todd's is a popular bar next door that also has food. Room 13, the Inn's own basement speakeasy, is open Friday and Saturday evenings and offers a quieter, more relaxing atmosphere, featuring unique early 20th Century cocktails (my favorite was "The Clover Club") and on some evenings live jazz. Bartenders and waitresses in both were friendly and gave great service. The inn is located in a busy and safe neighborhood within a two minute walk from the Belmont Red/Brown/Purple Line CTA "L" Station. It is convenient to both fine and popular restaurants and other shopping conveniences. For baseball fans, it's an easy walk or one stop train ride to Wrigley Field. This is a very old, but clean property with first class hospitality. It's not modern with all the bells and whistles, but I'll be back because it's clean, safe, friendly and likely the best value in Chicago!
