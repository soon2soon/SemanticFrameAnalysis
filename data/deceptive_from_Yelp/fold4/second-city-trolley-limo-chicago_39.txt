We rented a trolley for my girlfriends bachelorette party a few weeks ago and chicago trolley rentals (now "second city trolley") was great and so easy to work with. Their office was very accomodating and our driver Ali, was a lot of fun and very professional!.  He arrived early and was waiting for us after each bar stop we made.  We had an iPod playlist we played on the trolley stereo, brought our own drinks and had a great time.  we will definitely do this again!  A very easy company to work with and a fun chicago experience!.
