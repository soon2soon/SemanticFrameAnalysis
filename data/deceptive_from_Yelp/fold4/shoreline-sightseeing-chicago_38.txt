I took the architectural boat tour on Sunday (2014-09-14). Our guide was Victor and he was amazing. He was.is a student of architecture and it shows!! His insight and knowledge into the Chicago skyline was impressive!!! He obviously cares about his city as he stopped and sent a picture text to a graffiti site when he spotted it on the tour!!
