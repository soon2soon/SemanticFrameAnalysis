Such a fun vibe at Soho house.  Headed the Allis after a dinner out. Stuck to classic cocktails (vodka tonic my go to) and really enjoyed the environment.  Crowded but we were able to grab seats at the communal tables. Great service.  Would have thought it would be pretentious but they were warm and welcoming.
