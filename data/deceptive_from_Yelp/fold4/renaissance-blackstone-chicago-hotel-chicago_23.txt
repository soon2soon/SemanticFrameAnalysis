My cousin recently had a wedding reception here and the entire party was impressed. I couldn't believe how big and how amazingly colorful this place is! Absolutely LOVE the carpeting and various designs, and it was no wonder my cousin picked this hotel for their reception. It looks like it may have been a little on the pricey side, but apparently that wasn't a problem and the reception went fantastically. We were all extremely happy with the service, the staff was very helpful with whatever little disasters struck, and everyone had a great time! Congratulations, S. and J.! I highly recommend this hotel.
