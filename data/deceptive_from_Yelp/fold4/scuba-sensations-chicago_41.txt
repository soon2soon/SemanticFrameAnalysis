I've had the pleasure of taking classes with the owner and primary instructor, Rami Hatamleh, for several years now. Rami's cool, even-handed approach to instilling knowledge and self-discipline was amazing. He is an absolutely wonderful teacher. I cannot stress enough how good he is. Â He makes you feel comfortable and safe, while also making a point to have fun along the way. He's really a credit to PADI and all around great guy who really makes you love diving and learning to dive.
