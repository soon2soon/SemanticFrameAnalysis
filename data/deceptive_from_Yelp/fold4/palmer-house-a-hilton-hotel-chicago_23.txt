A lot has changed since I stayed here 10 years ago. The front desk people were not very friendly and gave us a room full of mildew and ceilings that were falling apart. The people before us were also in the room when we opened the door, very awkward. On the flip side, the main dining area was excellent, clearly where the money goes, and the history of the hotel is really cool.
