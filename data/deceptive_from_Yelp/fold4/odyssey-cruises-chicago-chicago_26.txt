I had a great time taking my girlfriend here. The boat is beautiful (Odyssey 2), the view of the city was spectacular, and the music was GREAT! The DJ played a variety of songs from classic love songs to dance music. I would have to say it was a great date. The service was great too! The only thing I did not like was the food. The chicken was dry and my salmon was cooked rare. Not something I was used to but still, my girlfriend and I had a great time. I definitely recommend booking for a cruise. Look for a GROUPONS! because they can save you money!
