This was the coolest thing I've ever done in Chicago. My wife and I took an architecture fireworks tour down the Chicago river. We saw all the buildings lit up at night.  Our guide Jeff was great.  He was very informative and entertaining.  There was an excellent bar on board with beer, wine, mixed drinks, even frozen ones and snacks.  We plan on taking this tour again this summer, and again once a year.  Every time we have an out of town guest we'll be taking them as well.  I can't praise this company enough.  Take this tour, you'll thank me later.
