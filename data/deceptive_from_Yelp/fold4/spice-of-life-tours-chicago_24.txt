We literally just walked in the door at home from our tour and I didn't want to wait to post a review; both my husband and I were beyond impressed! I purchased a private tour for my husband for Christmas and we clearly didn't want to waste any time before redeeming it (especially after reading all of the fabulous reviews; people were absolutely correct in posting their rave-reviews!) My husband adores Indian food and I had never truly tried it prior to this afternoon; I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner! We are both lifelong Chicago natives but neither had been to the Devon area before today; this was the PERFECT way to experience this extremely interesting area of our beautiful city. Mr. Ali did an INCREDIBLE job today! His impressive knowledge and passion truly made this experience one worth raving about. This was much more than a food tour; it was a cultural and historical experience as well. I would highly recommend this tour for both out-of-towners and Chicago locals. Thank you again Mr. Ali for a fabulous time! (We are both still full!) **If you decide to book a tour, COME HUNGRY! (The amount of food that you try is unreal! All delicious and all something that this former picky-eater would absolutely try again!)
