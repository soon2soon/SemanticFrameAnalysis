I would recommend this because it is new and creative idea. Pros: 1) Availability of cars in your vicinity. 2) Safety and good communication from relayrides.com 3) Renter and car owner protection. Cons: 1) Relay rides would ask you a lot of verification documents even at the time you think you are done with the paperwork. 2) Prices are not that cheap that you would expect from a peer-peer rental.
