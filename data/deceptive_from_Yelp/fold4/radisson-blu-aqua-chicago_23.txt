EXCELLENT HOTEL!   We stayed at this hotel for three days prior to our wedding (September, 2013) and got ready there before heading over to the ceremony church and the whole time it was great!  The hotel looks awesome, the rooms are clean, comfortable, and quite big, and the hotel staff are great to work with!  We had several specifications or things we asked for throughout our stay there and the staff / management was always accommodating and willing to help! We though the price we paid was great given that it is such a nice hotel, right in the center of downtown Chicago by Millennium Park!
