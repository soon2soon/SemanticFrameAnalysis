We arrived at boarding time and was immediately seated in the dining room.  And although we were the first to arrive, we were assigned the worst table location, despite having paid full price for the dinner and scenic cruise.  We asked the host and hostess twice to move us to a table out of traffic and away from the stage.  But the request was never honored, although better tables were available for the remainder of the cruise. As soon as we were seated they began to serve dinner - an hour ahead of departure time.  We were not asked if we preferred to dine first or to enjoy the boat and scenery during boarding.  Later, as the boat departed dock, we helped ourselves to the upper deck for the view and group photos, regretting that we had missed the first 45 minutes of scenic sunset views of the pier, shores and skyline.
