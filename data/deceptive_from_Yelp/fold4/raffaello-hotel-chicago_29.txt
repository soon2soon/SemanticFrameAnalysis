I went to this hotel because I thought the outside and the lobby looked really nice and the location is phenomenal.  Well I was quickly disappointed in many ways.  First, the elevators are slow and small.  I waited a very long time to get one.  Then I had to wait multiple times because the elevators were being used by the service people from housekeeping and engineering.  I asked about their service elevator and was told it was broken.  Then I go to my room, and the door was broken (literally taken apart).  The front dest person didn't know about that.  So I wait for three more elevators (because the first two were full of service people and we didn't all fit) and I went back down to the lobby.  I was given another room where the sink was broken.  And there was no soap.  I WAS TOLD THEY RAN OUT OF SOAP!  How is that even possible that a hotel can run out of soap?  So I asked them to please give me some more shower gel so I could use that as soap.  This hotel has potential because of the location and the rooms are spacious.  But the service level is quite low.  I will not stay here again.
