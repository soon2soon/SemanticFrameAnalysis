My friend and  I were very disappointed in this Inn. Adjoining rooms - the Inn keeper couldn't find the key. The lighting was scant. Since the TV  Dish was damaged... No TV. Couldn't read either ( no lamps by the beds) The bath mat was dirty and stained. It wasn't cleaned every day as it should have been. No towel bar and no vanity to set your toiletries on. The street is loud all through the night. We were told that there was a backup of sewage in the speakeasy (Room 13) two weeks before. I would definitely not recommend The Old Chicago Inn.
