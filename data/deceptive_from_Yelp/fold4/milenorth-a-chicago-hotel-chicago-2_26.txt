this place was terrible. They charged us an extra $200 that we were NOT informed about beforehand. They hardly seemed to care that we were so upset by it. Obviously if we knew about it, we would have brought the money! thankfully we managed to get the money together with the help of family but it was such a terrible way to start off our weekend. They said they would adjust the price since I showed them the email that didn't have any indication of paying Â for that, but when i went up to the counter on monday morning, they said they wouldn't do it for us! On top of that the room was sub par, it looked nice, but the beds were uncomfortable. The shower was big but the water pressure was so low it felt like I was washing my hair with a sprinkler. The wifi was terribly slow and always had limited connectivity. The rooftop bar was nice but $11 for a basic drink? wow! Ferris & Jack was okay, the menu could have been bigger. Overall I was very dissatisfied. Some staff members were a lot nicer than others, and it was in a nice location, so its got that going for them, but I will NOT be going back to this hotel and I will not be recommending it to my friends/family.
