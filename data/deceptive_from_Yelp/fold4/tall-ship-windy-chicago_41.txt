Two other friends and myself did the "A Sailor's Life For Me" trip.  Beautiful boat.  Got a chance to see the gorgeous Chicago skyline from the perspective of being out on the lake.  Erin was terrific!  Had lots of info on what it was like to be working on a ship out at sea and on a ship on the Great Lakes..   Very fun personality!  Thought they did a great job.  We had fun!
