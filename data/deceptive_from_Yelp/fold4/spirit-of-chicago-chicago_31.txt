Talk about spirit! Mine was revitalized when I took the Spirit of Chicago dinner cruise on Memorial Day weekend. It rained a lot that weekend, but the gods were kind and the skies cleared up in time for my cruise on Saturday night. Right away I was mesmerized by the skyline views. No wonder Travel & Leisure rates Chicago's skyline the best in America! As for the rest of the Spirit experience, the tilapia fillets were tasty, the pasta was appropriately al dente (impressive for a buffet), and the chocolate fondue was delicious and decadent. But back to that Chicago skyline. Despite good performances by the d.j. and dancing waiters, I wanted to spend every non-dining moment out on the deck. I watched the the boats, marveled at the lights, spotted a lighthouse, snapped some pics. The Spirit of Chicago is a delightful cruise past a standout skyline. Take your camera. Leave your cares behind.
