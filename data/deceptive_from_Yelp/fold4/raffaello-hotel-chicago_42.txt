Stayed here on a whim the other night based a friend's recommendation and am so glad to have done so! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The building itself was absolutely gorgeous! Our suite was stunning. Kind of wish I could live there. And the bed was beyond comfortable. My only regret was not having a chance to visit the rooftop bar while I was there. I will most definitely be staying at the Raffaello on my next stay in the city!!!
