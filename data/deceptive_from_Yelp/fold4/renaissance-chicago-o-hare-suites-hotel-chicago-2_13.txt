They charged our account twice!  They took out over $700 for two nights! Then it took days to refund 1/2 of our money back, which was all they would refund.  When we called the hotel about this problem they transferred us to 6 different people; and each person told us a different thing and had a different "policy" as to why they would not refund our money
