I've stayed at Ray's three times over the past year or so, so I guess it is no surprise that this review is a favorable one.  Reading over previous posts I just wish I could be as eloquent as others in writing such a thing. Ray's Bucktown B&B is clean, fun, in a great location, and becoming a bit of a home away from home for me.  Ray and his staff are pleasant and helpful.  On my most recent visit my wife came along and she found the place very pleasant as well.  We stayed in the Annex and enjoyed it. On each visit I've stayed in a different room.  All were very comfortable.  There is a correlation from my limited sample between room price and room size - not surprising I guess - but as a normally hotel chain kind of person I had to learn this for myself. We will certainly continue to go to Ray's when in Chicago.
