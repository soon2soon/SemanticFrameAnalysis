One of the best advantages to booking here is the location -- just one block east of the Magnificent Mile and close to a wide array of shops. The hotel was recently renovated and it really shows, starting with the well-kept lobby and extending into its clean, comfortable rooms. Yes, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but in my view the great service (travelers have come to expect this from boutique hotels anyhow) more than made up for that. I booked my room on the hotel website when I visited a few years back and on getaroom.com the second time around. I'd come back here for business and leisure.
