Best time ever!  this was our first time riding a Segway.  Our guide, Johnathon was very nice, fun and knowledgeable.  He made us feel very comfortable and our kids loved the tour.  We had to wear snowsuits due to the cold weather and we were very glad they provide these.  Wonderful experience!  Recommend it to any family with teenagers. Super fun!
