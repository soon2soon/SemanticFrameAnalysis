I was very excited to stay at this hotel during the Christmas season 2014 and left VERY disappointed. My daughter and I spend a weekend in Chicago every December and I booked my room and package very early (6 months prior). I booked an executive level room with a package deal. While checking in I asked the front desk clerk if my key would activate the exec elevators because she didn't mention it at all. She then proceeded to tell me that I did not reserve a room on the exec level but only requested one. This is absolutely not true as I remember making this booking online. She then told me that my package was better than being on the exec level and they had no rooms on that floor to give me. I went to the room which she assigned and was appalled at the size. Â Immediately I called the front desk and spoke to the manager. He also advised that I did not book an exec level room (even though I had a copy of my confirmation) and could only get one for me in 4 hours at an additional cost. I refused to pay more so he did find a larger room for me. The room I was in was only 180 sq feet and the new one was 340 sq feet. Unfortunately the new room was surrounding by a very young and immature wedding party. They kept us up all night long for two nights. We left this hotel exhausted and extremely unhappy. One more thing, the pool was nice and warm but the air temp in the pool room was freezing. I stayed in the pool up to my chin for as long as I could. I have to say that this is a beautiful hotel but the terrible customer service makes this a very uncomfortable and undesirable hotel to stay at. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone (unless you are young, rude and do not care about sleeping).
