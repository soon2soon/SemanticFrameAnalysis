My wife and I recently had a destination wedding in Cabo San Lucas.  We had 40 guests travel from all over the U.S. (Chicago, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Utah, Denver, Houston, Austin, and Albuqurque), all of which booked with Ryan Roman of Sunset Travel.  Ryan was great and very helpful.  He had many ideas and gave us many options as to where he thought would work best for us.  Once we narrowed it down to Cabo, he helped us pick the perfect hotel.   Ryan found us all great deals on the trip and most impressive he was able to work with our guests from different cities. Ryan and the employees at Sunset Travel were very patient and understanding when dealing with all of our guests concerns or worries.  My wife and I did not have to answer questions regarding the travel arrangements from any of our friends and family.  Ryan took over and made everything run smooth. As far as the hotel, he booked.  It was beautiful and everything he said it would be.  We stayed at the Dreams Resort in Los Cabos and it was amazing.  Ryan did a fantastic job and we will definitely be using him again. We definitelyrecommend using Ryan and Sunset Travel if you are traveling. Sunset Travel will inform you of a lot of options and help you narrow it down to your specific destination at a great price.
