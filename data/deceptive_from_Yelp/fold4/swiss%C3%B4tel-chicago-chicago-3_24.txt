I had a New Years Eve reservation. I was in town a few days ago and decided to stop by. I wanted to see the type of room I would be getting, as I wanted to compare to the Sheraton and Hyatt Regency.I had booked a junior suite, but was shown a corner suite (not sure why). I loved the view, so I told the associate I wanted a room just like it. He said no problem, and would leave a note in the system so I could get that exact room, if possible. The last thing I asked on my way out was if the price would remain the same, and he said yes. I even made a joke of how we needed more people like him. I took his name down and was going to provide some positive feedback on his behalf, after my stay.I called to get my confirmation number today, only to find I was not booked for the room I had requested. Apparently they called this employee, and he denies telling me what he said. He claims he advised it was available only if I upgraded. That makes perfect sense, and I wouldn't be upset over it if it were true. He never told me I had to upgrade, and why would he leave a note in the system for me to get a corner suite if I wasn't booked for it?Customer service (the 800 number) was useless. Although she was nice, they were unable to help me. My only option was to pay more. I wanted something closer to the lake, but now I realize why I keep returning to Hyatt. At least they can admit a mistake and make up for it.
