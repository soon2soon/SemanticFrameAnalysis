Needed to change a flight, a mere 2 hours difference and southwest wants to charge me $150, about the same cost as my original airfare.  Needed to get home for a school function for one of my kids.   Apparently Southwest is not that "family" friendly as they make themselves to be be. Done with this airline after 10 years of being a loyal user
