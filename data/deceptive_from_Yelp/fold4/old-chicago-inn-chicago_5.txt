I recently stayed at the Old Chicago Inn.  Unfortunately, the inn was not anything like most of the reviews I previewed before booking the place.   I commend the photographer who provided the pictures for their advertisement.  But in this case, the pictures are not worth the thousand words.  The room was dirty (2 inch dust balls behind the furniture), dust on the curtain blinds, and there was mildew on the back of the shower curtains. The main section had a scent of body odor, the breakfast was an unknown serving in a cassarole plate,the coffe was lukewarm, and I couldn't find a freshness date on the breakfast bars and boxes of cereal.  One other thing, the inn is one block from the L train.  Unless you are accustomed to the sounds, you probably won't sleep well.  About the only person I would recommend this to is someone returning from a Cubs game (within walking distance) who might have over embibed, and doesn't care where they sleep. I am sorry for the unkind words, but sometimes the truth is needed for changes to occur.  The building has great potential, but I believe has bad management at this time....
