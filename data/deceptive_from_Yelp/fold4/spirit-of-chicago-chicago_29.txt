I planned a special event for our division including several special guests who came in for a training session from all parts of the world.  There were 27 of us in total and from the reactions the next day, everyone enjoyed the evening immensely.  The ship was very nice, having been renovated recently and the buffet was delicious and plentiful.  We had tables reserved in one area of the deck and the service was very helpful and accomodating.  As soon as we arrived at our area, the champaign began to flow.  As the ship left the dock, most everyone was enjoying drinks and the gorgeous view of the skyline on the outside deck.  Even the weather cooperated, it was a very balmy summer night on Chicago's lake shore.  No one from our group seemed to want to go inside to the disco for the entertainment and dancing, but those who were there seemed to enjoy the music, singing and dance lessons.  The fireworks show was a wonderful culmination to a very successful evening.
