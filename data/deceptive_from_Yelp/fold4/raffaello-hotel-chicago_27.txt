Very very small room, even smaller bathroom. The picture make the rooms look decent size but you have to turn sideways to go between the bed and tv. Very disappointed and will not stay there again. The only positive is that it is close to pretty much everything. Oh and the shower had a rain shower head which was very nice except the shower was one piece of glass that covered half the shower so the floor was constantly wet. Â Weird
