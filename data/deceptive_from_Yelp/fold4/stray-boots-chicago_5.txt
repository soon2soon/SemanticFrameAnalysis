We did the Loop tour and really enjoyed it. The smartphone app was easy to use and provided a little extra info about the areas we visited. We definitely saw things that we wouldn't have without it. There were three adults in our group and we all worked together to work out the clues. (Having the smartphone helped in case we needed to Google!) We're planning on trying this in other cities that we visit. It's an inexpensive and easy way to explore.
