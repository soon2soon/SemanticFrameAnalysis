Beautiful place but a bunch of pretentious jerks who run the place. I am an artist in Chicago Â and when I discovered this place and the fact it's across the street from my reception I was so excited to tell my friends and family to book a room here for the night of the wedding. Unfortunately, they have only 40 bedrooms, which is understandable. However, I was told if we book individually as guests that are rooms are subject to cancellation because we are a wedding party. Why would any one deny business? This place is stuck up and I will take my money elsewhere.
