My husband and I dined at Renaissance Blackstone Chicago Hotel while visiting Chicago last week. The dining room is lovely and inviting, the wait staff were attentive and gave us excellent recommendations based on our preferences. The wine list is impressive. The flavors and ingredients in each course were complex and interesting. A terrific meal from the first bite to the last and a lovely, memorable experience.
