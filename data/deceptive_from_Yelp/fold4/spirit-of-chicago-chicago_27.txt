The eighth grade students, parents and teachers are still talking about this wonderful trip.  Everyone from you to the crew and especially the DJ were just fantastic. They loved the food, loved the ship, and loved how they were treated as mini adults.  The teachers and parents were impressed with the DJ who got all the students dancing.  They got wonderful pictures for their memory book.  You also gave them memories that will last a life time. Our students were paired up with a school from Kentucky and they were a great group of kids.   Thank you for taking such good care of us. God Bless you and the whole Spirit crew.
