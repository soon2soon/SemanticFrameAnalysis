Front desk was very unprofessional and rude. NOTE TO REWARDS MEMBER: Make sure you double check that its your rewards no they have on file so you can get the proper credit with the hotel you paid for. Based on our experience, we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights with this hotel using our rewards no and prior to check out we noticed a different rewards no was put on file so we informed the front desk and have them changed it. WELL apparently she DIDN'T change it because upon checked out, we got our bill through email and we noticed our friend's rewards member was still put on file! There is apparently no way for Marriott to secure your rewards no since it can just be changed by anyone! Anybody in your party can show the front desk the room key and BOOM, rewards no can be changed..(per front desk!) SO DISGUSTING!
