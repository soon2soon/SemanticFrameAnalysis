Just returned from Playa Del Carmen, Mexico-beautifu! The Iberostar Lindo(all-inclusive) had everything anyone could ask for. An abundance or restaurants to choose from. Endless pools , a wave pool and a lazy river. If you want to be near the beach ask for a room in the 51 block. Also very close to the kids pool are and lazy river. wonderful white sand beach with activities for all ages or just a lounge chair on the beach you will not have to lif a finger. Waitresses and waiters on the beach. The pools have 3 swim up bars. If you want a descent drink ask for a double or else you will drink a lot of frozen sugary drinks. The best drink was a Miami vice(double). Half pina'colada half strawberry daiquiri and rum layered between. The best. Beer is abundant as wells tequila. Ask for the good tequila. The best restaurants are the Japanese and the mexican. The main buffet and the buffet at the beach were also very good. The mall is nice and the ice cream parlor was amazing. Had an ice cream every night after dinner. The bar at the pariso del mar and the beach were the best. Entertainment was fun and everyone works so hard it was a fun family night. If you snorkel you must go into Cozumel. Use uncle edsventure for the best experience or ask for henan from funjet. He's at the hotel. All and all the best vacation for the money and everyone was happy , including our 16 year old teenager. We needed twin bed brought in , no problem. Unlimited room service , no problem. Restocked fridge with all our favorites including beer, no problem. Amazing vacation , can't wait until May when we return!
