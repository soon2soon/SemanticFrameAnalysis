it was an AWEsOmE Â tour, the guide(Ali) is really informative, i highly recommend it to everyone, even if you are not familiar with INDO-PAK culture you should try it, its fun and adventurous. lots of interesting things to see and lots of yummy food, after taking this tour it felt like i never knew this part of the city even though i have been there before,its totally a different culture all around you. Seeing Devon the way it actually is, is the best part of the tour.
