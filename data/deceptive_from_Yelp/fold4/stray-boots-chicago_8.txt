Just did the Magnificent Mile hunt with a pack of 13 year olds as a birthday party.  So much fun!  The girls all loved it.  And even I learned something new ... after living here for years.  I could also see this concept working well for families when traveling with tweens/teens in a new city.  In one word ... fun!
