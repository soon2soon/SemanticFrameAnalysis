The Spice of Life Tour is a Great Adventure!  In just a few hours one will experience the delicious tastes of four Indian cuisines, ranging from snacks to appetizers to dinner entrees.  There's even a stop for Vegetarians. Your host, Ali, provides a fascinating history of Indian culture and its arrival to famous Devon Avenue.  You'll walk to several stores and experience Indian literature, fashion, jewelry, and even visit a Sikh temple.  It's as if you've gone to India for a brief vacation.  As one who virtually had no experience with Indian foods, I was VERY pleased with the entire menu.  Everything tasted delicious! In fact, I will definitely make a return trip to one of the stops on the tour....the Tiffin Restaurant.  You will enjoy the Spice of Life Tour.  Your tastebuds will rejoice, your memories will be pleasant and you will have a wonderful afternoon.  Have Fun!   - Alan C.
