The hotel was ok, but do not book if your expecting spa services. My Mother's day was ruined, The entire reason I picked this hotel was because it offered spa services. I made an appointment days in advanced and booked the hotel. Comin in to Chicago from out of state, I had planned the events of my 2 day trip. The day before my massage, someone called to change my appointment. First they wanted to change the details of my appointment. I mentioned I would just call around town she offered to accommodate my request (only a double classic massage for 50 mins.)   from 10am to 12. I rearranged my itinerary to accommodate their scheduling conflicts. Once at the spa, they will still very far behind. Not wanting to wait in the hotel my entire trip, I cancelled. I missed an event to accommodate them and didn't get the massage I planned my trip around. The hotel has a nice location and the room we had was nice as well. I didn't have a problem with the hotel, but unfortunately I will not be returning. The hotel  did refund the late check out fee we agreed to pay in order to have the massage time changed.
