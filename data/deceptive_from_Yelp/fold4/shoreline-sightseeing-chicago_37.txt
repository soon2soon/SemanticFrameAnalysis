Wonderful service! This tour allows you to see the beauty of Chicago while also learning about the city's history. Jim Collins was our tour guide and his character and presentation made the entire tour enjoyable. He truly knows the history and architecture of the buildings and was able to weave all of the information together to create a beautiful story. Highly recommend!!
