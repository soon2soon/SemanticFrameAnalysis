I highly recommend Scuba Sensations.  They have met and exceeded all of my scuba diving needs to go out and just have fun safely.  If you decide this is the place you want to learn you will not be disappointed....Read my experience below. There are a ton of positive things I can say about Scuba Sensations but I will try to keep this short. I got certified in 2012 at Scuba Sensations.  I knew I wanted to try scuba because I love the water but I wasn't sure how well I would catch on.  Rami made all things simple and easy to understand.  Since that time I have gone on about 5 trip and about 20 dives. Rami is not only a good person but an excellent instructor.  I remember having a hard time treading water for the 10 minute certification requirement. Rami gave me simple tips at the pool but then he actually jumped in the water with me to demonstrate what he was verbally explaining.  After listening and watching Rami I was able to tread for 10 mins.  In fact I couldn't believe how fast the 10 mins went by. I could have went another 10 mins with no problem!! That's just one example. The man is Good Yall!! :) I want to touch on my shopping experience at Scuba Sensations.  I go to Rami for all of my scuba diving needs and questions.  I highly value one on one attention when making decisions regarding equipment that holds my life.  I like going into the shop feeling like I'm the only one in the world that matters.  Rami does this for every customer! Rami examines your scuba goals and help tailor equipment to match.  Rami will answer all of your questions and spend as much time to help you make good choices about equipment.  I personally have never mind spending my money for this kind of service. In conclusion; if you desire a skilled instructor, professional atmosphere, and one on one attention; this is the place for you.  The minute you walk in the shop and hear Bob Marley playing in the background you'll feel right at home. Please excuse any typos!!  I'm not a writer ;-)
