I was celebrating my graduation from medical school and I have to say that I was very happy that I went on this dinner cruise after a few months after my actual graduation because this experience would definitely spoil my memories of this special event. What I liked: beautiful boat, views, Chicago harbor fireworks What was OK: food, waiter service What I didn't like: small tables packed very close to each other so you don't have any privacy, a horrible unprofessional DJ, strong smell of gasoline even on the upper deck, people smoking on a crowded upper deck. If you are looking for an upscale special experience, this boat is definitely not an option. It's hugely overpriced for the service. It's crowded, the food is standard, and entertainment is amateur at best.
