I needed a car to get to Ikea and a few other place in the suburbs, and RelayRides was perfect for me. I have used Zipcar in the past, but returning the car within the time allotted was always stressful. Not to mention Zipcar charges this fee and that fee. Relay Ride is perfect. It provides a platform for people to interact with one another to rent their vehicle. My overall experience was amazing, the car I rented was kept immaculate, and the owner had a lock box to make pick up/drop off extremely easy. Next time I rent a car, Relay Ride will be my first option.
