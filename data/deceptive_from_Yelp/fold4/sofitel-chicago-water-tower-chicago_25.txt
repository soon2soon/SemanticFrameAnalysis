I did not stay at the hotel . I was at the bar for a meeting place with a tour guide. The guide failed to show up and the bar manager Brian ,and the bartenders Eric,Kevin and Mike took a personal  interest in our situation and went above and beyond to help us. It turned a very bad time into a very plesant experience. Everyone of the staff that we encountered was extremely kind and willing to help. A company that employes such a wonderful  group of employees is outstanding in my book. My friends and I can recomend that anyone in the neighborhood should stop in and check out the place. Its like stepping into another world. They have such class and are special people. Give them a chance to make your day as special . Also check out the ballroom for any events you might be planning. Thank you from all of us. Your
