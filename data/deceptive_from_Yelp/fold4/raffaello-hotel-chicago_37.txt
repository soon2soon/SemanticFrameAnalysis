I needed a place to stay in downtown Chicago for my nephew's graduation trip. Though I am familiar with Chicago, this little gem had not been on my radar until I found a great deal through one of my travel sites. It was half the price of the other hotels in the neighborhood, but the quality was twice as good! The staff was excellent, very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed sitting on the rooftop patio (which had a nice view of the lake on the north side) in the mornings and evenings. It is an older hotel without some of the more modern amenities, but it was clean and our room was beautiful. It also was spacious enough for the four of us, had a mini bar (though we didn't use it) and refrigerator space for our personal items. The hotel is located close to shopping and restaurants and is central to the CTA busses and trains, so we were easily able to get to all the sites in the city. Parking was also reasonable at the garage across the street. They even won over my father who hates staying in the city. We will definitely be staying there again on our next trip to the Windy City!
