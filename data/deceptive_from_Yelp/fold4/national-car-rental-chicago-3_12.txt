I want to give HIGH praise to Richard, who works at this downtown Chicago location. He is the most amazing employee of any car rental agency I have ever had the experience of renting from. He was super helpful with my walk up reservation, got me into the Emerald Club, and was personable and took an interest in my rental needs. I also observed him with the customers ahead of me and he was 150% awesome with them too. Love love love National now and will continue to rent cars here. He truly deserves kudos and recognition.
