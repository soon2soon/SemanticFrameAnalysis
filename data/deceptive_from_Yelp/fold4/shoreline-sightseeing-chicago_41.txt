My old college roommate and I took a tour and really enjoyed it. Our guide was very knowledgeable and wrote her own script after during her own research. She pointed out some great and unique features of most of the major buildings. We even dined at CITE on top off Lakepoint Towers after she mentioned it during the tour. We wish her well with her new baby on the way. I found a great rate on line and it was worth every penny.
