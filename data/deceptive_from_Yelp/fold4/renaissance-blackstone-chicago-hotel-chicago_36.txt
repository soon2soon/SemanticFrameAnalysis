Stayed at the hotel this past weekend, and was very impressed (scored a great deal on priceline for $120 a night). Â The room was big, the beds were very comfortable, the decor was cool, and the bathroom was nice and big. Location is good, only a 12 min walk to canal (Wrigley Bldg). My only two compliants is the maid staff did not replinish our dirty glasses or tea and coffee supplies and they need free wi-fi
