Travelers with Pets beware!  Southwest will charge you twice at the time of check in with your cat or dog!  Charge for travel with a cat or dog is $75 one way.  They reserve the right to charge you twice as they did to me!  You may have to pay $300 round trip!  Southwest puts additional charges ($75 each flight for your pet)on your credit or ATM card which they will leave on your credit card for as long as they are legally allowed to! I've asked them to lift these additional charges but have not received any satisfaction.
