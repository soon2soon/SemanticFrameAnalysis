I am an Emerald Club member, and I rent from this location all the time.  The service is great.  The cars are ready and available right away.  The car performed great, and was good on gas (Chevy Captiva).  I brought the car back on time, the employee was pleasant, asked me how the car was, and printed my receipt.  I simultaneously received a receipt by email as well.  I will definitely rent from National again, particularly at this location.
