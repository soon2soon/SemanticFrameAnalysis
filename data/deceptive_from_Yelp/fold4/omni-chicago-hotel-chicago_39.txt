I hate that I have to rate the Omni a 1.  The Omni was always our first choice of places to stay when we came to Chicago - especially at Christmas. We've been staying there for the past 11 years.  But this will be our last time there!   We stayed there the weekend before Christmas and I realized after we got home that I had accidently left a coat and scarf hanging in the hall closet.  I only wore that jacket TO Chicago - I never wore it while there because I wore my warmer/longer dress coat instead.  The worst part is I had a memory stick in the pocket that had 300 to 400 of my family's photos on it (some of which we were planning to make into a print for my mom for Christmas).   I called the security office the day after we left and they "looked in to it."   Obviously the maid said she didn't take it and they said it was not hanging in the closet.  I even begged them to talk to the maid again and tell her she can keep the coat, I only wanted the memory stick back.  It's been almost two weeks since we were there.  I have no coat, no scarf, and no memory stick as of yet.  It has been 6 days since someone has even called me to see if she was willing to give the memory stick back.  If I had to guess, I'd say the maid probably still has her job.   I realize it was my mistake that I left the coat, but accidents like that have happened before and businesses have worked something out to mail things back.  There just isn't good customer service anymore and I'm finding more and more dishonest people.  What a shame!!  Needless to say the Omni will no longer get our business and I will not be recommending it to my family or friends.
