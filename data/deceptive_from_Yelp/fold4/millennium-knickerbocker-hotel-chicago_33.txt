The location of the property to Michigan Ave and shopping is excellent. The cost was comparable to the area. The room however was small with a king sized bed in the area that should only have a queen. There was some kind of scaffolding outside our window and not realizing this workers were right next to our window. The flat screen T.V. had a poor picture with no H.D. available. Carpeting outside the bath was torn with sharp areas that unfortunately were stepped on. Bathroom sink drain was very slow. Internet access is an extra cost and seems old fashioned in today's market.
