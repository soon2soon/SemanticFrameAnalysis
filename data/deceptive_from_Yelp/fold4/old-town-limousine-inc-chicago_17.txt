Old Town Limo is absolutely the best car service my company has ever used. Always on time, clean, new cars with chilled  bottle water waiting. It's a the combination of poise and  customer service without being intrusive that separates this company from the rest. I appreciate their professional service enough to use them personally when traveling with my family to and from the airport.  Honestly, I look for reasons to use this car service whenever I can. The prices are comparable to taxi and the quality of ride is so much better.
