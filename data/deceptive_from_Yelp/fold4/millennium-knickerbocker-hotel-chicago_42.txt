I used a Groupon and was thrilled with what we got. Check in was fast and pleasant. The room was cozy and comfortable -- great bed! Yes, the walls are thin but it's an old hotel. there was a wedding on Sat. night and we weren't disturbed in the least. The bar is very nice, good drinks, friendly bar keeps. Don;'t do the breakfast buffet. exp. for what you get (cold eggs) but they have a nice menu. Â Within walking distance of everything. We will definitely come back. Thanks for making our weekend so fabulous!!
