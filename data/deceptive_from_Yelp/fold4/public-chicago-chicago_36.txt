When selecting a hotel for our wedding block, we wanted a hotel that (1) was in a good location, away from the super touristy area of Chicago while still being convenient to all the wedding festivities; (2) was not "cookie cutter"; and (3) fit, my now, wife and I's personality and vibe...The PUBLIC Hotel fit that mold. Upon signing the pretty standard contract with the sales group, you are assigned a day-to-day contact at the hotel, who will almost certainly be Megan Moran.  I cannot stress how incredible she was to work with.  She went far and beyond to make sure your wedding hotel experience is perfect.   She was readily available and always had an open line of communication.  Her main concern was making sure our entire wedding block was happy from small requests (making sure a nursing mother had an empty refrigerator in her room or putting us in contact with the appropriate contacts at the Pump Room and Library Bar) to the larger requests we had (ensuring access to the beautiful AVA room on the 16th floor for pictures, upgrading our parents room or helping us organize the gift bags for our guests)... There were only a few negatives and few situations where it was like pulling teeth to get what you want/needed.  I will not go into detail because, really, Megan made up for any "bad taste" I had following those conversations (especially after one particular incident I had with the Director of Sales & Marketing, Melvin Guerrieri; who should really take a lesson on customer service from Megan) ... During our wedding weekend we could not have asked for a better hotel- from the bellhops up to the onsite manager, Paul...Top notch service!  Paul was the man!  He bent over backwards to ensure our guests and most importantly myself and my bride were happy.   A special thank you, again, to Megan and Paul specifically!  They were nothing short of amazing!
