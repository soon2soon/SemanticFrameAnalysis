The tour was an awesome way to explore this part of the city. I learned a lot and ate a lot of good Indian food. The henna tattoos were fun and were included in the cost which is an added plus. I never drank Indian wine before which was tasty. The best part was being able to eat different types of Indian food like appetizers, curries and BBQ. I laughed so hard when I found out that the tour guide's name was Mohammad Ali. Too funny. Even though he is a history teacher he wasn't boring and made it fun.
