We had a fantastic time at the Radisson Blu Chicago. The staff was very helpful, they upgraded us at check in. Everyone was so nice all around. The room was gorgeous, we had a wonderful view of the city from our room. The bed was amazing, I actually called to find out what kind of mattress it was to purchase for our house.They supply you with complementary snack and drinks. There is even a Ipad to use in your room. They have a lovely bar down stairs that is very classy as well as a nice restaurant that we had a delicious breakfast at the next day. The hotel is conveniently located to all the shopping and restaurants on Michigan and State street. We were able to walk to all of it within minutes. We loved it and cannot wait to stay again!
