I just had to share our positive experience on the Spirit of Chicago lunch time Saturday cruise. We enjoyed our experience from the moment we got on the boat. The food was excellent and hot for a buffet. The desserts were delicious, too. We skipped the dj and dancing only because we could do that anytime. We sat at a table on the deck and enjoyed the view of the Chicago skyline. The staff was friendly. The only thing that I could foresee warning someone about is you do have to climb a lot of stairs but that is unavoidable. We will cherish the scenic pictures we took and remember our day on the lake.
