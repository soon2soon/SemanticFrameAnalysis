I give relayrides one star! The customer service department is great, however, the car owners are shady. Relayrides need to screen the car owners  because most of them never respond to customer's request  or they decline your requests. I was approved and booked a car two weeks in advanced for my college graduation and the day I was suppose to pick up the car the owner text me to tell me his car broke down...yeah right! He had two weeks to tell me that.. he waited  the day before my graduation to tell me this!!!! WTH!  The chances of getting a migraine or a broken toe or seeing the tooth fairy is more likely than getting a car from this company... There is no tooth fairy which means your chances of getting a car is slllimm! I will not deal with this company again. I gave them several chances and each time was a nightmare. Never again!
