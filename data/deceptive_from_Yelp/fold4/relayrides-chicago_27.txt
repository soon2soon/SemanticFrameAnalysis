This was a great deal for renting out a car for a week!  RelayRides was great for a cheap rental - other car rentals wanted twice as much.  And the car was picked up and dropped off at the airport.  It was a great experience. My rental car person was even flexible on how many miles I could put on it and it was overall a wonderful experience. The car I had borrowed was a little older, but still got us where we needed to go.  Only downside was the car we borrowed did not have a working cigarette lighter outlet, so we were kind of scrambling to work with our GPS.
