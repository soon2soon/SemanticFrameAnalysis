Great food options and other stores to keep you busy. I take the Jefferson Park train to Ogilvie and then to Elmhurst occasionally, and the arrival time at Ogilvie and the departure time for Elmhurst is about an hour, which is frustrating for many but give me free time to do as I please. Overall I like what this station has, it's better than Union Station and I prefer the food here as well.
