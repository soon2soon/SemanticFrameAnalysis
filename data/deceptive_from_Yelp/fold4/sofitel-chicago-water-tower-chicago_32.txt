Sofitel Chicago Water Tower It was just what we were looking for in the heart of chicago and not over expansive either. We stayed there for 2 nights and it was a perfect place if you are in the city for a long weekend or to cover maximum out of the limited time. We booked through expedia and the room was allocated with a view towards water tower which was awesome. It was spacious, clean and pleasant. Room service was a plus point and with a kid it was a treat.
