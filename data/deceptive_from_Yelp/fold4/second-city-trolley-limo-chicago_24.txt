My husband and I recently got married (July 24) and used this company for our wedding party ride. We were so excited to use a trolley, and unfortunately the company ruined that experience for us. We were initially told that the Orlando was available so we planned on booking that one. However, once they received our contract, they said it was no longer available but that they would upgrade us to the Sophia for the same price so we were very happy with that. On the day of, the trolley arrives, and mind you is about 100 degrees that day with the heat index, and there is NO AC. Are you serious?? You send us a trolley on one of the hottest days of the summer and there is no working AC?? Their website boasts that all their vehicles have AC, but if you are to consider them for booking I would make sure that the AC is working, but apparently they don't have the courtesy to let you know that there is no working AC. We were so hot and uncomfortable, it was miserable. They should not onlyu have makde us aware of the situation, but they should have sent us with a different vehicle in that instance. We had grandparents and parents who were unable to ride with us due to the extreme heat on the trolley. So very disappointing. On top of that the driver had no idea where he was going, even though he had a GPS. My husband and I were not able to enjoy the trolley ride due to the fact that we had to stand up there next to him and direct him where to go. I would not recommend this company to anyone given the nature of our situation.
