Anyone who tries this and likes it is lame and never really lived in Chicago (not counting the Burbs here). I went on one of these and these noise polluters aren't worth 5 bucks you could better spend ACTUALLY being in Chicago. Get off Michigan Ave and Wrigley Field and Pizzaria Uno...and out of your helicopters and see Chicago you lameos! Â People rate this high because they are embarrassed they spent this much. You stink!!!
