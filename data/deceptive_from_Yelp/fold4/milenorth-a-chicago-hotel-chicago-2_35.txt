stayed there two nights.(room 1505)  great price on LivingSocial.  beautiful hotel, furnishings, fixtures etc.  very comfy room with all the amenities I needed. wife wasn't entirely thrilled (no vanity mirror, hairdryer) but I had everything I needed. My legs are not in great shape so I wasn't thrilled that there were two steps down inside after you walked in so had to be really careful.  also the double bolt lock that locks from the inside didn't work and I told 3 different front desk employees about this and each one said they would have the engineer fix it.  they DID NOT fix it and I felt very unsafe when we were in the room and couldn't dead bolt the door (especially sleeping). had a little issue with the elevators not working properly.  all in all though a good experience at a fair price. great location.  we would probably stay there again
