This tour could not get any better!!! As the tour guide, Ali is amazing- he's friendly and upbeat and clearly an expert on this neighborhood. Every stop along the way was Â memorable, and the owners were very invested in making the experience authentic and the food delicious (some places even gave us a tour of the kitchen). Definitely come hungry to this- restaurants served us full sized portions (definitely not the tasting portions I was expecting!) No person will leave this tour hungry or unimpressed- it's definitely a great way to spend the day and learn about the food, languages, dress, and culture that exists on Devon. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
