My wife and I took the Grant Park - Lakefront tour.  We had a beautiful day, the Segway's were a blast, and our guide, Royn, was very helpful, informative, and entertaining.  This was our 2nd time on Segways, and we'll likely do it again! It's amazing how intuitive the Segway's operation becomes.  Very quickly they feel so natural!  A great way to see Chicago!
