Having ridden Segways before, we saw the great reviews for this dealership, and decided to book the Navy Pier tour.  My wife was in town for a business conference, so she got four friends of hers to join us.  They'd never ridden Segways but were up for an adventure. Eric was our guide.  From instructions to our four beginners to some really great and interesting commentary throughout the tour, it was a superb experience.  Highly recommend the Navy Pier tour if you want a longer more interesting and varied gliding experience. After the tour was over, Eric completed our day with a referral to Miller Pub for great lunch and lots of brew choices!
