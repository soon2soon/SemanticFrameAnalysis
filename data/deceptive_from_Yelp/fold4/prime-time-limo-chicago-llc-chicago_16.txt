I only write yelp reviews when I get one extreme of service or the other. In this case the service was SPECTACULAR. We used them for a wedding limo service in Chicago and Pat, our driver was great. I was a bit nervous about the schedule and he put me at ease and got us everywhere we needed to be with time to spare! As advertised, there was a "complimentary fully stocked bar" in our wedding limo. None of the other limo companies in Chicago that I called were offering that! All in all I'd say that these guys (and especially Pat) made the wedding better than it might have been had we gone with another company.
