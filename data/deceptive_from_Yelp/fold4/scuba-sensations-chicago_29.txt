Working with Scuba Sensations to get my Open Water Diver certification was a great experience. Rami and his crew are wonderful. They are all knowledgeable, helpful, and fun to work with. Rami has been great about keeping up with me and offering his help to find further dive experiences. I would recommend Scuba Sensations classes as well as the dive shop to buy equipment.
