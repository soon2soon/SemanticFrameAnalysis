We have stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Towerseveral times when visiting Chicago. The service is excellent, attentive but not overbearing, and friendly. The rooms are luxurious and spacious, with several amenities. The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel's location is perfectly situated for shopping on Michigan avenue, restaurants, and so much more.
