We recently stayed at MileNorth to celebrate a friend's 60th birthday. It was all we could have asked for and more. Its location is absolutely perfect, with wonderful shopping on N. Michigan Ave. a short block away. The best part about MileNorth, though, is the staff. Everyone there was very friendly. Each time we entered the lobby, we were greeted by name, which was such a welcoming touch. We will not hesitate to stay there again and highly recommend it to people looking for a nice, clean hotel in a great location.
