I am a 1st time renter from RelayRides.  I needed an SUV with a tow package to carry a bike rack and 4 bikes for a week long trip.  The regular rental companies are a bit dicey on committing to what size and type of vehicle and they wouldn't commit to a tow capability in advance. (Not sure what they expect you to do on departure day!)  I found RelayRides by chance and lucked into a perfect vehicle with a very responsive and communicative owner.  I was a bit skeptical at first but the trip went perfect and the customer service leading up to the rental was very prompt and helpful.  I normally use Zipcar for around town and Enterprise for 3 or 4 day rentals but I think I'll give this another try.  It's a great concept and is very convenient with many cars and SUV located close to home and public transit.  Bad renters or bad owners can really spoil the experience, but my 1st time was great!   John B
