We were in Chicago for a weekend with our 20-something children and played the Loop tour as a race:  Parents vs. kids.  We had a BLAST!  The app works very well, the directions are clear and there is a nice mix of challenges.  (Some easy, some hard.)  I would absolutely do this again wherever it's offered - either as a race or taking the time to actually read and absorb information, stop to eat/drink, etc.
