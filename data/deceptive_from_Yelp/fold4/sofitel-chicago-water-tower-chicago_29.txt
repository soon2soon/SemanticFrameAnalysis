I was a guest at the Sofitel Water Tower Location in Chicago IL from Aug 11 -Aug 12 2013. My stay was for pleasure as an overnight birthday gift for myself. My otherwise enjoyable stay was marred by an incident that occurred upon my return to the hotel from celebrating my birthday. I am an African American woman that was staying alone in my room. Upon my return to the hotel, as I waited for the elevator, I was approached by a male staff member who asked me was I a guest of the hotel. I replied "yes". He then asked for my room number, my ID, as well as my room key. This gentlemen came from behind the concierge desk and left his post to approach me. I took offense to his request for this information, as people were in and out the hotel all night. I informed him that as a woman traveling alone, that I was uncomfortable giving him my room number. Furthermore, that I would not be showing him my room key and ID. Upon my refusal, a second male employee came from behind the desk and joined in on the questioning. I felt intimidated, accosted, and ganged up upon. I have stayed at several hotels in downtown Chicago, and this was my first time experiencing this. I hope this was not done because I am African American, although I was the only African American I saw during my stay. I did not witness anyone else being stopped as I was. I informed the Manager upon check-out of my experience. He assured me that he would follow up with his staff. However, he did not seem genuinely concerned, was hurried in his conversation, and seemed to just be going through the motions, and saying what he thought I wanted to hear. I chose the Sofitel to celebrate my last birthday in my twenties based upon the reviews I read online, and its prime location. However my experience was marred, and ended on a sour note. It was very demeaning. Sincerely, A disappointed guest
