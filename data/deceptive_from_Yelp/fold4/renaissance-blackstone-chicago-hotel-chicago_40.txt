Absolutely most gorgeous Marriott we have ever stayed at - the lobby is rich and luscious, traditional but with a modern twist.  The rooms are spacious, and we lucked out with a great view - the Adler Planetarium, the railroad, Grant Park - I loved seated in a fabulously comfortable leather chaise next to the window looking out.  The rooms are beautifully and creatively appointed, with modern furniture, and some very nice amenities (iPod docking station, several great books about Chicago, very plush robes, wonderful dimmers for the over-the-bed lights, etc.).  My two major complaints, however, were the linens on the bed (they felt great, but were so starched, that the sound they made when I moved in bed, woke me up every time - very odd), and the door to the bathroom (a slider hung on a rail - no lock, and a 1 inch(!) gap on each side, ensuring no privacy!)  Otherwise, the service was very prompt and helpful, and we liked the hotel restaurant "Mercat a La Plancha" - very creative tapas, and a great "Chef's Choice" menu.  If you are a AAA member, use your membership to get a discount at this hotel - we got 30% off!
