This is my first review of a hotel. I am a diamond member in the Hilton and basically live out of a suitcase mostly in a Hilton, occasionally a Marriott or a Hyatt. And so, one of my trips brought me to the Palmer house - Hilton Hotel. For a supposed 4-star hotel this place is a piece of crap. I have stayed in many many hotels and this hotel treats its  patrons rather poorly. The first time I came to the hotel, I was flying 13 hours from the west coast with all the transfers and when I reached the hotel, they told me that they could not check me in because their systems were down. They told me to take all my luggage down to the bell desk and come back in an hour and hopefully the systems will come back up again. After all the tugging back and forth, the guy at the desk gave me a bottle of water as a form of apology. I am a diamond member and not even a room upgrade. He said and I quote "You have the best room in the house" and guess what when I go into my room, an average king, the bathroom lights do not even work. I was too tired to complain and I went to sleep.   I was there for 5 Business Days. On one of the 5 BDs that I was there, I meandered my self towards the bar and ordered me a glass of wine. I picked my favourite malbec and the bartender asks 6 or 6 oz and I say 9 oz. I was shocked when I got the bill, $25.00 for a 9 oz Malbec. I googled the bottle and the entire bottle at the store costs $12.00. The place does not even have laundry facilities. This place is a rip off. It has history and a lot of pictures, but its time the ownership stopped gloating on the history. In the hospitality industry, service is still KING. To give where credit is due, this hotel has the best gym compared to all the hotels in the entire world (at least the hotels that I have been in the entire world and there have been a few).
