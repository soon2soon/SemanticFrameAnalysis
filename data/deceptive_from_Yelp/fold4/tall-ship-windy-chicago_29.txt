I happened on this ship last Saturday with my cousins and sister, during our annual reunion.  We had been wanting to take a sail boat ride for a few years and this looked inviting with the pirate theme.  The day was nice and the view from the ship was beautiful, of the Chcago shore line.   The "pirate" insisted we needed to listen to his talk during the sail, that we would miss out on an exciting part of the trip if we didn't.  We came down from the upper deck of the ship to sit and listen, but his "talk" was boring and non factual.   There was also a girl who appeared to be connected to the crew somehow but further ruined the experience for us. She passed out the blankets and sat right in front of the "pirate" during his speech and assisted him at times.  She was dressed inappropriately with a short, lowcut dress that didn't fit in with the "pirate" theme, but on top of that, she sat Indian style, lounged around so her various body parts were hanging out of the dress and underwear could be seen.   She obviously was flirting with the pirate and there appeared to be some "hanky panky" gonig on between them.    At one point, a girl crew member on the upper deck "complimented" her on how "hot" she was, but we thought the crew member was poking fun at her.  It was very inappropriate in any setting but especially since there were children aboard.  I would not take this ship again, if the same crew was involved.
