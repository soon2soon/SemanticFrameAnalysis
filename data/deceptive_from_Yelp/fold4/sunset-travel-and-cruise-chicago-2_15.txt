My husband I were referred to Ryan and Sunset Travel and Cruise several years ago and we have been coming back ever since.  We have booked several trips through Ryan and he has never disappointed! Ryan has always helped us pick the best locations and hotels for our trips.  He has a lot of excellent first hand experience at many of the resorts and his recommendations do not disappoint!  He has helped us get the best prices at the best hotels and his wealth of knowledge about the travel industry has gotten us some great deals! We were so happy with the excellent work he and his co-workers do that we decided to have Ryan help us plan our destination wedding for us and our family.  Ryan recommended a location and hotel and we could not be happier with how our wedding turned out!  He booked all our travel and the travel of all of our guests.  He was patient and responsive with everyone who booked and even helped some of our guests change their trips several times.  Ryan also went above and beyond to help us communicate with our wedding coordinator in Mexico.  If we ever had an issue we could count on Ryan to quickly and efficiently help us resolve it.  If you are thinking of planning a destination wedding we definitely recommend using Sunset Travel to help organize everything!   Needless to say we love planning our trips with Ryan and Sunset Travel!  We can not say enough how much we appreciate his help and experience! Every time we start thinking about planning a trip we know we will be making a trip to see Ryan!
