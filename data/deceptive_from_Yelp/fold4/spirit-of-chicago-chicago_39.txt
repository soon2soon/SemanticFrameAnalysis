I hosted a Lincoln Park Young Professionals Event on Spirit of Chicago last Thursday and have to say it was amazing. The boat is beautiful and perfect for weddings, birthday parties or corporate functions. All my Sponsors were impressed. What made the event even better was the polite, professional and very helpful staff from the Captain to the managers on duty. Everyone wanted to help and really made the event go smoothly. Truely a great expreience and am telling everyone to book their events with Spirit of Chicago. Joel Lincoln Park Young Professionals
