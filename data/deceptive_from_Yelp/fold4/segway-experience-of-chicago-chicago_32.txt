Eric and Adam, our tour guides, provided us with a thoughtful tour, emphasizing the beauty of the city and safety on the Segway. They really deserve a huge raise because I have never seen my family get along and have such a great time at an activity. My Grandmother, 75 years old, was nervous about using the Segway; however, her concerns were immediately pacified by Adam's attentive and empathic assistance. It's an activity for people of all ages!
