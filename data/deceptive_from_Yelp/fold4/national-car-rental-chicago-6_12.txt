This was the 1st time I flew into Midway, I usually fly into O'Hare,  I had to make a change on my reservation so I had to stop at the counter instead of going directly to choose my car. First time having a counter experience, but it was pleasant, actually every single employee I encountered greeted me with a smile and offered assistance. It was different than going to O'Hare, but different doesn't mean bad.  Great employees make all the difference.
