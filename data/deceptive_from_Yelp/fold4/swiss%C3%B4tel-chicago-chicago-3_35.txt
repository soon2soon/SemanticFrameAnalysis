stayed here through hotwire on 5/3. Hotel was designated a 4 1/2 star when booked but later hotwire said it as an error, should have been 4 star. either way the room had stained broken furniture, very poor service in hotel, dingy towels, bed spreads and pillow shams, and could not get simple things like toothpaste. parking was highest i have seen in Chicago, $62.00/night ,in room movies 17.99.per movie,  beautiful views, nice bathrooms but not a clean hotel. Conrad, intercontinental and Palmer much better.  went out and returned after 12 and room not cleaned. maid came up and spritzed a few times, made bed, picked up towels and left. I do not recommend. the holiday inn express is cleaner. nice pool and fitness center but both cost extra as well a internet.
