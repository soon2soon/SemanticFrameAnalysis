If you are into run down old buildings with somewhat terrible service, then this hotel is for you. Seriously, the room descriptions, pictures are probably from 10 years ago. Tiny rooms, old beds and peeling paint. Two floor room in a description means a room with two steps! Â Its really not worth the money other than location. Much better hotels in area.
