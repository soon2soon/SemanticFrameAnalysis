Loved this experience! It was a great chance to learn about the architecture and history of the city with a fun and hilarious twist! We loved hearing Red Beard's stories and the way he told the history in an interesting way with his quick wit! As it was the last sail of the season, it was quite chilly, but the staff provided blankets for all the passengers. What a kind touch! We also ordered drinks from a very kind and helpful bartender. The price for our drinks was phenomenal as well! It was nice to be able to roam around the boat and get some awesome pictures. The rest of the crew was also very interactive and willing to answer any questions you might have. Their rope tricks were pretty astounding as well! Had a great time! Would definitely recommend to people of all ages.
