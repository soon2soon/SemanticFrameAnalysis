We recently used this company for our wedding on May 21, 2011 to transport our bridal party and friends. The driver appeared unkempt and not very presentable in addition to getting lost on several occasions, even with us giving him directions. For the amount we paid for the service, you think they could at least spring for a GPS! The actual trolley served it's purpose of getting us from the church to the reception. It was not clean or well taken care of and was not what we were expecting for what was being charged.
