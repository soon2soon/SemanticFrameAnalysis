Suite Home Chicago is amazing! Jen and Sarah found us temporary housing on very short notice with 1 big request...to bring our 2 cats with us. SHC placed us in a large  studio in the Gold Coast.  A great home away from home for 28 days while having remodeling done. Close to the office and close to our home. The Suite Home Chicago. team is very responsive and the unit was well-stocked. I HIGHLY recommend Suite Home Chicago!
