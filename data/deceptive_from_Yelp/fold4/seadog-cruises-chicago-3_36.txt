30 minute lakefront tour was quite lame.  Hostess (or whatever you would call her - Guidess?) made really bad jokes that she repeated over and over.  Pointed almost NOTHING on the lakefront and with no historical background. Ride is pitifully short.  Quite a snoozefest, except she was so annoying to listen to, that you couldn't even catnap.  And the music - really?  Sweet Home Alabama?  That isn't overplayed at all.
