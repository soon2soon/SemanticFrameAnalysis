I contacted Second City Trolley for a bar crawl the weekend before the fourth. Everything went perfect. The front office staff was very polite and accommodating. They called me a few days before to confirm and Randy (the driver) called when he was on his way. He showed up about 15 minutes early and we all loaded our beverages and group in the trolley. He drove us anywhere we wanted to go including Â abandoning Lake Shore Drive at the last second (heavy traffic). The trolley was great. It was clean, open, and had a great sound system. All in all, I would definitely rent another trolley from this company. They were professional, on-time, and everyone had a blast.
