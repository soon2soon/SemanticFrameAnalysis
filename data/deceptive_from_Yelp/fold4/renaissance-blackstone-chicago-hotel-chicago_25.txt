The Blackstone Renaissance is without a doubt one of the most beautiful hotels in Chicago!  It lends old Chicago elegance to a modernized hotel that sparkles from the lobby to every room.  Our son and his new bride chose The Blackstone for accomodations during their wedding week and weekend for themselves and our guests and family members.  Their wedding was 8/21/2009 at a venue north of downtown and without a doubt the hotel and its staff members made the entire week and weekend fantastic.  The building and decor are stunning!  The beds are so comfortable, the pillows just right, and the room darkens easily with Roman shades so you can rest anytime of day or night.  The service is simply outstanding - there's just no other way to describe it!
