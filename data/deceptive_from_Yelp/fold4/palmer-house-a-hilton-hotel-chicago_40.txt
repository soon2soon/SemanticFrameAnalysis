The absolute worst NYE experience I have EVER had..... EVER .  Having also paid for the VIP tickets $450.00 , and told of the abundance of food and drink that would be available, it was SHOCKING!!!!!.. Arriving at 935PM, we were told to wait in line for wrist bands, with representatives for each cluster of the alphabet, our letter had a long line where we waited 25+ minutes, when other staff had NO lines and just sat and would not help.  We make our way,  having to ask for information, to the coat check which was located  down the escalator to the elevators up to 3rd floor, wait no.... go back up to the 4th floor, through a room full of sponsor booths?  Selling whatever (TACKY TACKY TACKY).  By 1015pm ( the event started at 900PM) the food was GONE.  After hunting for a bar, we found one tucked in a corner, we stood until just after 11pm to get a drink, in PLASTIC cups, it was suggested we get another drink right away.....and what?  No tables or chairs to sit.  Were we to walk around double fisted????  What about a dance with the love of my life,  oh no that was definately not in the cards, we hurried back (2) floors down to the largest ball room which was the romantic theme of our first New Years date, celebrate alone in a sea of people!!   My wrist band has now fallen off and security giving me a semi bad time about it.  Well we were told the Grand ballroom was filled to capacity, we were to rush back to the 6th floor, which we did not,  we settled on the 4th floor (and techno music) to find a spot to usher the New Year in, no confetti, no hats, no noise blowers, the count down video screen malfunctioned.  After midnight we find an open bar for our 2nd drink and all the mixes were out.  Did we want a cup of Vodka??????  Well at least we could drive home sober.  SOBER would definately describe our mood.  Shame Shame on you.  Oh and you might as well take or return my calls, I will not stop until I get my money back.  :)
