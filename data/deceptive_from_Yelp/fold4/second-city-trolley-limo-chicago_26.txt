We hired this trolley for our wedding day.  There was a ridiculous mark-up in price just because it was a "wedding" compared to any other 4 hour service.   The trolley itself was fine.  Enough room for the entire group and ran great. The driver however was incredibly rude!  He was not friendly to the group and would battle about making stops to get pictures taken.  We basically had to beg him to make one more stop for pictures even though we were driving right past the last place we wanted to stop.  I understand we had time constraints for what we paid for, but he wasn't even trying to be understanding or considerate.
