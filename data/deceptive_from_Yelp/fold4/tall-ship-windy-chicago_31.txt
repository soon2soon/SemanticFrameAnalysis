It was just great to be on the lake with friends,i'd never wouldv'e paid FULL price for this ship(but thanks to living social ,but had to pay almost $9.00 tax on 3 tix,YIKES.)& yes we can do wothout the FAKE pirate accent & boring story told by one of the crew members. also,it's no fun for kids they should have more entertainment for kids.interaction,music, something to keep them from falling asleep. what they charge for snacks,drinks,etc is absurd.$2.00 for a 50cent soda,capri sun(that's usually $2.00 for 10-12 in a case),$2.00 for 25cent snack crackers.basically inflated the prices on all these normally cheap snacks. actually it was only 60 not 75min,guess had to have time to DOck,etc..
