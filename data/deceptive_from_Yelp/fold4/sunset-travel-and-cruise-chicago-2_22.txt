I wanted to thank- SUNSET - TRAVEL for a job Â "very" well done for my family's first cruise, Marta talked to me for about 20 minutes and asked all kinds of questions, she was very attentive, and very fast with returning phone calls or answering questions, will definately use them next time we book a cruise. Juan Jose Pinto. (jay-jay)
