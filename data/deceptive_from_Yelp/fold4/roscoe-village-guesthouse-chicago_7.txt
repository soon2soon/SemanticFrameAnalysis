We stayed here for my sisters wedding weekend and it was just fine for three couples and a toddler. Plenty of room to congregate in the kitchen/dining area. It is in a great location, very close to grocery stores and decent restaurants. Plenty of street parking right outside the door. The beds were comfortable and it was nicely decorated and appointed. It was very nice that they offered for us to use their pack and play (we didn't need it) and they also had a booster chair for my toddler. The park that's close was a great place to walk to and have my child play for a while. My only complaints with this house are: 1. There was no wi-fi available 2. The upstairs bedroom was significantly warmer than the rest of the house when it was hot outside. It really needed its own air conditioning unit. 3. The floors were dirty. We didn't feel comfortable walking around without shoes on in the house. The rest of the house was clean. Â 4. Something was wrong with the dishwasher. It seemed to be working but would run for over 2 hours and still not be on a different cycle? It still seemed to clean the dishes well. Overall we had a good stay here and would recommend it to others.
