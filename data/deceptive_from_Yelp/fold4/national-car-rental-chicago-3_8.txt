I have rented from this National Car Rental location on numerous occasions because they are convenient to my business office and the majority of my rentals are for business purposes.  My check-in/check-out is extremely efficient and the cars I have received are always in tip-top shape and very clean.  As an Emerald Club Member I always receive an upgrade, which has enhanced my satisfaction.  Richard is extremely efficient and accommodating.  Darius could use a little updating in his customer service skills.  The pick-up staff is great. If there is any negative to renting from this location it is their hours, particularly if I rent on a Friday evening and need to return on a Saturday.  That 3:30 closing can be quite tricky.   I prefer this National location over Budget/Avis and I would never again go near that Enterprise location on Randolph between Wabash and State. Finally, with reference to National, I would be remiss if I didn't mention how horribly their customer service has fallen at Midway.  It was using this facility that made me a fan of National, but the last time I rented from Midway it was your worse nightmare come true.  The Manager on duty "Megan" has just moved over from Enterprise and it showed.  I also suspect all the major car companies use "Rent-A-Temp" at Midway on the week-ends as the counters are staffed by inefficient, highly unskilled personnel.
