treated like a 2nd class citizen had the room for a weekend of my 32nd birthday also had a dinner party at c house food was good . Hotel staff was horrible after dinner went to c-view with remainder of party and ran my guest had 3 tabs one of my guest was cut off after 3 shots matter of fact all of my guest. Bartender was rude and didn't explain the reason or even give an explanation why we where cut off (BTW I only had one of those shots because someone(really no one) complained about smoke but it really was because some of my party (guest) were in my room chilling my party was a group of 11 2 Latino 2 bi racial and the rest African American. I didn't"nt see any other African Americans in the hotel that day or night. They did have some that were working there. Dinner tab for 6 ppl 700.00 Tab for 8 ppl that were actually taking shots 500.00 rooms I rented 500.00 I am absolutely appalled that I was treated this way and when I talked to the night manger she gave me a complimentary breakfast for me and my fiance value 36.00...If you are planning to go here I hope u don't like rap r&b have friends in town that are black Latino or bi racial. Also I canceled the rest of my stay that night. Â Prejudice is still alive no matter how much money u still can be treated like a second class citizen smdh..
