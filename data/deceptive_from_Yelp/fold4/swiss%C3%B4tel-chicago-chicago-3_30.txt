We prepaid for 4 nights, and our key card stopped working after 2 nights.  For some reason they had us down for 2 days after we confirmed while checking in that we were staying for 4.  Even though they sorted it out, our key cards (new and old) never worked after that.  Every time we came to our room hoping it would open, it wouldn't.  We got to know the security guard well.  There was never any apology for our inconvenience, nothing.  I don't ever want to sit outside one of their rooms again waiting for help.  Ugh!
