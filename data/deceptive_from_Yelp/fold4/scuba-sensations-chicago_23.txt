First and foremost I had the most wonderful experience at Scuba Sensations.  I am now a certified diver and I owe it all to Scuba Sensations and the folks there especially Rami.  Personally, scuba diving is something i've always had an affinity for.  I have never been a strong swimmer so year after year this deterred me from learning.  A friend of mine (Who is training to become a dive master @ Scuba Sensations) brought me to the shop, introduced me to Rami and I've been hooked ever since.  Apparently scuba diving requires you to be comfortable in the water and not an olympic swimmer! I set up private lessons which afforded me ample amounts of pool time and 1 on 1 or 1 on 2 sessions.  Rami was my instructor and although he is hilarious he is very serious about not only teaching but making sure you learn the proper techniques of scuba diving.  My gf had taken a weekend course at some other shop and on our first trip together, the skills, techniques, and knowledge I had definitely surpassed hers and the other beginner divers.  I owe this to Scuba Sensations and the time and effort they put into all their students.  Scuba diving is a life changing experience and I am so grateful to have learned and learned well.  I'll be going for 2 other certifications and I can't imagine going anywhere else.  EAT SLEEP DIVE!
