I really recommend this hotel for people visiting Chicago. I always stay there. It gets better and better, It's conveniently located with great views of the lake and on the park and near to shopping. The gym, pool and spa are all well maintained and not overcrowded given a hotel this size. I stayed over the New Year's holiday. The hotel was full and catered to a wedding as well as the usual new year's crowd. Service and security were excellent. All staff were friendly, as usual and anxious to please. Breakfast and dinner were well prepared and served. And for me a mark of excellence is clean bathrooms. I will continue to stay here on my trips to Chicago.
