Waiters, valet parking, cleaning ladies excellent service, very serviceable persons, love them !!! Reception Staff seems tired, not helpful at all, didn't clarify anything at check in, ending up paying more in parking because of their lack of clarification, wrong breakfast coupons, had to go back at least 2 more times to get it corrected.
