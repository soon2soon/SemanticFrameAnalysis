I have been a client of Sunset Travel in Lincoln Park for more than 10 years , and have worked with Martha for all this time. She is an excellent travel agent, always helps me and my family book the best possible deal. She is fast and very friendly. I would never book anywhere else, I will always use Martha's help in booking any kind of trips in the future. Thanks Martha and Sunset Travel for making my vacations memorable!
