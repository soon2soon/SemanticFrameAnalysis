While I appreciate the kindness of the conductors and employees of restaurants in the station, the ticket agents are very rude and unjust.  I use this station many times a week, and I have NEVER, in my multiple years of using it, experienced even one polite ticket agent.  They are all full of attitude, judgement, and rudeness.  I have been insulted multiple times by them, when all I ever wanted was my ticket. There are usually only 1-2 lanes open for collecting tickets, which is not right considering the lines stretch very long full of people who need to be on trains.  It's hard to understand why there are only ever two agents actively working because I always see other ticket agents in back chatting with those 'on duty'.   As far as the trains go, they often leave on time, but they rarely arrive back at the station on time.  On the Union Pacific West line, the train often does not make scheduled stops or crosses over to the other side of the track while the announcements state that it will be on the regular side.  I have been stranded by this train numerous times, and I would certainly not rely on it completely.
