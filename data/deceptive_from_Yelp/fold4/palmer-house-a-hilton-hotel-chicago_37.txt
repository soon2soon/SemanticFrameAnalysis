One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at. Don't let the "pretty" lobby fool you. The food is just a notch above cardboard. Barely edible. And way overpriced to boot. I paid for Internet access for a day, and then it tried to charge me twice in the same day for Internet access again. Despite two attempts to remove the charge from my bill, I was still charged and finally had it removed upon checkout. The rooms - meh. Bare bones. Looking for privacy? Nope, you won't get that here. Housekeeping kept on trying to come in and clean my room while I was in the shower. Maybe it's because they don't speak English and can't understand you when you say "please come back in 1/2 an hour." Oh and expect to get someone else's bill under your door in the morning. Screw privacy at this hotel. The staff are rude, unprofessional and of no help. Just stay away.
