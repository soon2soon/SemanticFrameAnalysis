Everything started out great! We got to the hotel 2 hours before check in and thought "hey maybe they'll let us check in early." Which they did.. We got up to the room on the 9th floor which was small for the $300 we spent for 1 night and there was no view of anything.. No fridge or microwave nothing! The bed was very comfortable though.. We went to get the extra blanket to use and it smelled like mildew and dust like no ones touched it for a very long time.. The next morning we got complimentary buffet breakfast with our room.. The people were rude and obviously didn't know how to do their job seeing as they were giving out milk that was 5 days expired.. Which you'd think they'd have fresh milk for what kind of hotel they are.. Nope! And I didn't notice the expiration of the milk until I drank some! We told the server they took all the old milk off the shelves but then didn't even care that I drank the milk! It was ridiculous.. 10 mins after we got to breakfast the waiter was coming to us with a "receipt" to sign and give him gratuity.. After breakfast we went to the lobby to talk to the hotel manager about what happened at breakfast with the milk.. They seemed not to care so they called the "food and drink" manager.. Who also didn't care and told me he could get me something from Starbucks if I wanted! So the hotel didn't care that they were giving out expired milk and that I drank it! We will not be going back to this hotel.
