I came here with no expectations and to find some info for a trip that I was taking to the Florida keys. I ended up buying the course after a very informative talk with the shop owner, Rami. he is so passionate about what he does and it shows through and through. My pool sessions were great and intense. This guy is serious about teaching you the right stuff. The great thing is that Rami, an instructor himself, has a funny sense of humor. He put me at ease at every turn. Taking my mask off in the middle of a dive is not what I would call fun, but he made sure I was prepared and calm for any surprises. I can't say enough about this shop. They know their stuff and are great instructors. I plan on continuing to support this shop with my new found hobby. If you are thinking of getting into SCUBA, plan on visiting Scuba Sensations for some useful knowledge and some funny stories. Rami even set up my Open Water dives in the Florida Keys.
