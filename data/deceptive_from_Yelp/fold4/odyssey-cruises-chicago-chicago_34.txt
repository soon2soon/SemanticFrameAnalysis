My boyfriend took me on the Odyssey cruise for a romantic night out and actually proposed to me by the end of the night. We were the first ones on the boat and the last to receive our dinner. Many people were receiving their desserts when we were just beginning to receive our appetizers. We waited approximately two hours for our meal to be brought out, and in turn, the meal looked like we were getting scraps what was left since we were the last to get served. Our waiter checked on us once to fill up our water and instead of getting us fresh water told us to use the ones that were already sitting at the table (we were sitting at a table of four) for the last three hours. Another issue that we had was the temperature of the boat. It was so cold the man beside me was wrapped in a tablecloth, and I sat on my hands to try and keep warm. It was difficult to enjoy our evening due to the freezing cold temperature. After my now fiance proposed, he told me he was disappointed because we spent so much time waiting for food that we didn't get to enjoy what the cruise had to offer (great views, dance floor, etc) and the entire night felt rushed. Once we were finished dinner, they announced that there was 15 minutes to fireworks and then the night was pretty much finished. The experience that we had on the Odyssey Cruise left us disappointed as this should have been such a special experience for both of us. I would not recommend this dinner cruise to another person.
