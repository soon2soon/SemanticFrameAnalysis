For business travelers on an expense account: Four stars. Heart of the business district, walking distance to good restaurants, attentive staff, breathtaking views overlooking the river. If you don't mind $6 for a cup of tea ($8 with tip), you'll be very happy here. For families visiting Chicago: Two stars. EVERYTHING costs extra. Breakfast for the four of us: $120, before tax and tip. Basic internet: $15 (High-speed, $25). Computer use in the business center: $7. COFFEEMAKER IN YOUR ROOM: $20. (Seriously.) We had requested a regular room with a rollaway, and I'd emailed to confirm it, but when we checked in we were told it rollaways won't fit in standard rooms. (I would have liked to have seen these rooms -- rollaways fit in motel rooms, for goodness' sake.) We needed the extra bed, so we had to upgrade to a junior suite for $100 more a night (but they threw in the coffeemaker). We'd spent the earlier part of the week at the Hyatt Place, a few blocks away, and next time we'll stay there the whole time. The base price for the two rooms was about the same, but the Swissotel ended up costing us about $500 more for the same two-day stay. Bottom line: Lovely hotel if money is no object, but it was obvious that vacationing families aren't the clientele the Swissotel is aiming for.
