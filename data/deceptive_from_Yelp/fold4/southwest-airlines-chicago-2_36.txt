We had the most horrible experience with blatently rude employees. Our flight Â was 30 minutes late. Checked again, another 30 minutes late and a stop (on a non-stop flight) was added to get fuel. There is no fuel in Chicago? We were referred to a curt "supervisor" who gave us a b.s. reason. (Bad weather in Orlando) Finally got on the plane and while the stop was made for fuel, went back to the restroom. Chatted with several passengers, not happy either. The flight attendant was sitting there and I casually asked about the stop for fuel and expressed that I have lived in Orlando almost 30 yrs. and this has never happened. She abruptly said "I don't like this any better than you". To which I replied, " sorry, but it isn't about you, it's about the customer". She stormed up the aisle. I came out of the restroom and was told that the captain wanted to speak with me on the breezeway, off the plane. He was not there but 3 rude and condescending employees, offering a physics lesson on why the plane was too full for us to go to Orlando without the stop. They knowingly flew the plane that was sold as non-stop and made the extra stop. The employee and her short temper should be reprimanded or fired. She could have said "I am sorry, it is for your safetly" or something more tactful. I will NEVER go on their planes..they are always late, the cattle line-up is lousy but not as disgusting as their old planes and employees. RUN from this airline!
