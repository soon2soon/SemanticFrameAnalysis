I had a wonderful time, thanks to our tour guides, Eric and Andrew.  They were very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  I was born and raised in Chicago and still learned some things about my beautiful city!  Riding the Segway is a great way to tour our city.  I plan to ride again to tour the other areas they offer.  Great experience!
