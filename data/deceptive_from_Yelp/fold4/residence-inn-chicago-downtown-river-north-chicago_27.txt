Service is not dead after all! Everyone who worked there was very friendly and helpful. My stepdaughter started believing all the service staff were her friends! She called for blankets in the middle of the night and they came right away. The room setup was nice and I loved the full kitchenette. Nice location! Overall I would recommend to friends and stay here again.
