Can't speak of the actual cruise since I was not able to try it.  The horrible review stems from the ridiculous policy; they can cancel due to weather if they want but you will not know how they feel about it unless you show up.  So I purchased the tickets earlier in the day, come the afternoon there was a big storm in Chicago (rain/lightning) so I tried to call to see if the cruise wold go out but it was past the office hours so the only way to know is to go to the ship (so if in fact they decide to cancel you make the trip to Navy Pier for nothing).  Since they said that it would not go out with lightning I did not show up so this morning I call to re-schedule and they tell me the ship went out.  The cruise might have been fun but I will never know; I live in the city so this was something to do with people that come to visit from out of town but I suppose I will stick with Wendella.
