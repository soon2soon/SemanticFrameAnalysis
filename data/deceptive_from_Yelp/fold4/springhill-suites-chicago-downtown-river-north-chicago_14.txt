SO MANY CHILDREN. My husband and I came here for a staycation in the city, and to spend some time in their pool, but we really couldn't catch a break when it comes to spending Time on the hot tub, don't count on it unless you enjoy hot tubs full of 4-10 year olds.  The rooms were nice though, comfy beds, cool decor.  Nice downtown location.
