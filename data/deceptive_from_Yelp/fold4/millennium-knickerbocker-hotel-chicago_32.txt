I'll start with the positives:  very comfortable bed and the room was clean and well maintained. The bell staff were prompt, friendly and helpful.  The bartender pours martinis with a very heavy hand when it comes to the liquor.  Negatives:  valet parking is $68 per night (you can get parking for $37 a night directly across the street).  The front desk clerk was almost rude when we checked in.  The hotel charges $10 per day for WiFi access.  Considering what we paid to stay there that's ridiculous.  I can get free WiFi at almost any other hotel.  The room was very small.  That in itself wasn't a problem but there are no full-size dresser drawers.  We ended up keeping our shorts and pants in the suitcase.  I don't like living out of a suitcase.  The hotel is currently undergoing some facade renovation and it's LOUD.  We were out late one night and the banging, power tools and hammering were not a welcome sound in the morning.   I wouldn't stay at the Knickerbocker again.
