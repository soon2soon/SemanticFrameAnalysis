I booked a company outing for employee appreciation to kick off our events for the year. I invited my VP of the company and they were all blown away. I get asked every day when can we do it again. The event was perfect from booking it all they way to when we got off the boat. I had a few people back out because of NATO but all that came had the time of their lives. Thanks Michelle for helping me with my event and I can't wait to work with you again.
