We used Second City Trolley on May 5th for a 50th Wedding Anniversary party.  The entire experience was WONDERFUL!!!  Doug was our driver an was very accomodating to ALL the needs of needs of our guests.  The trolley arrived on time, actually early to surprise my parents.  When we were done with lunch at Navy Pier, we called and he was right there.  He was able to surprise my parents with a stop at the church they were married at,along with a drive by of the homes they grew up in.  I would recommend them without hesitation.   My parents are still talking about this trip!  Thanks again for making the day a memorable one.
