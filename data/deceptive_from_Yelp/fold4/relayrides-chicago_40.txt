Had a great experience using RelayRides.  We were on vacation in Chicago - so we took public transportation for the majority of our trip.  We wanted to make a daytrip to Notre Dame and ended up booking with RelayRides.  It was about half of what the other rental agencies cost - which offset the cost of gas.   We chose RelayRides over Zip-car and other rental places because, even though it is a little more work to coordinate with the car owners, there is no annual fee, and no sign-up fee. We had excellent communication with the car owner and overall the whole process was simple.  Will definitely use again.
