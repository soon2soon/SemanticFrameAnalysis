Hello everybody, I'm from Canada and I I travel a lot in Chicago. I use Chicago Signature Limousine exclusively for the past 6 years. And I'm very happy with their services. I have tried others limo companies but I was not happy until I had the first trip with Signature Limousine. Â  I saw the others reviews and it seems to be an error because in +6 years I never had a single problem with them. Easy to book with Chicago Sgnature Limousine. They are always on time and they have the best way to book via email. They send you confirmation and receipt right away. Every time the limo was super clean. The drivers are very professionals and courteous. I prefer Irina, she's so professional and so familiar in the same time. Thank you Irina!! Best and reliable company in Chicago! I highly recommend them!!!
