My wife and I booked a room here for the night of our wedding;  primarily because the lobby area was ideal for wedding pictures and they had a suite available large enough for the women to take pictures prior to the ceremony.  While the price was reasonable, we were ultimately disappointed for the following reasons: the room received very little natural light (a requirement for pictures I specified when booking the suite); the room was freezing because the hotel had not yet turned on the heat (even though it was September, we had a cold spell and heat should still be available in each room); and finally there is no room service (one would assume a reputable hotel with a fancy on-premise restaurant would offer room service!).  We were so disappointed to wake up the morning after our wedding exhausted, with feet aching, only to learn there was no room service - not even just for a cup of coffee!
