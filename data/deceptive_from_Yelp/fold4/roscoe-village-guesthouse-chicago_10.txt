My family and I wanted to do a mini-vacation this summer in Chicago.   We live in the suburbs and were looking for a comfortable place to spend a few days, so we could see all the sites of Chicago.  We were very impressed with Roscoe Village Guest House.  It was nice to have a full Kitchen and enough space that my 2 teenagers could each have their own room.  Our Unit was very clean and the owner took extra time to meet us and make sure we knew exactly what was immediately around us in terms of restaurants and transportation.  We will definitely recommend Roscoe Village Guest House to friends and family!
