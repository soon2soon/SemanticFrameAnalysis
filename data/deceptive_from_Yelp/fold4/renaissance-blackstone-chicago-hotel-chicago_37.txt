This Old-line hotel has been completely renovated and is absolutely beautiful.  We are from the  suburbs  and stayed their for our anniversary.  We were met by complimentary wine and fruit in our room and a  view overlooking  Buckingham  Fountain and the entire lakefront.   The bed was comfortable, the bathroom marbled and beautiful and we would definitely go back.
