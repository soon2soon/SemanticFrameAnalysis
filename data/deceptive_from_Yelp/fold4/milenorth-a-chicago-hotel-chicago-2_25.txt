The first room they put us in had a broken AC.  It took 4 phone calls for them to come look at it.  Maintenance "fixed" it for 20 minutes and it went out again.  They would not move us so we sweated in bed on Night #1 in Chicago.  The 2nd day we were moved to another room which also had AC problems.  We sweated on Night #2 in Chicago. They "fixed" it on Day #3.  Nights #3 &4 were fine.  They insulted us by trying to "make-up" with drink coupons.  We have kids and did not drink.  They then tried to charge us an extra $20 Hotel Service Fee upon checkout which I did not pay.  I asked to speak to the Manager on Duty, he was busy.  I asked them to have him call me, which he did not do.  He also did not return my e-mails.  We will not be staying at MileNorth Chicago again.
