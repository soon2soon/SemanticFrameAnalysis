A group of ten of us ladies were rescued by Shawn when he offered to drive us back to our center city hotel.  We had left the Aquarium and there was not a cab to be found.  We were so grateful for the ride that we arranged for Shawn to provide car service for us for the remainder of our stay.  Most of the time we were picked up in a limo.  On the way back to the airport, Shawn provided SUV's because of the luggage.  Shawn was prompt returning my calls or texts and he and his fellow drivers were always on time and extremely courteous.  Shawn was also very flexible as several times we had to change our schedule and needed an earlier pickup.  If you are a group of ladies (or men)  looking for a dependible and professional car service, this is the company to use.
