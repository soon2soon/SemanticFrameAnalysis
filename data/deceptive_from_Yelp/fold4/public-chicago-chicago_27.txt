Had I reserved this room on Priceline for 80.00, it would have been an adequate room. However, reserving a suite at 400.00 per night (without tax), makes this room and this rate simply theft by deception. The room is advertised as a king suite. There is no king bed, not even a queen. It's a double. The website advertises a queen pullout in the living room. No pullout. The desk was contacted and said "that room does not have pullout, but does have a view of State Street." Other things advertised but missing from the room include the pair of easy chairs, the 55 inch flat panel (it was 44) , a mini fridge, ant the entire table and chairs conversation area depicted on the floor plan. Room service consists of a delivered box lunch. I am not kidding about this. The noise level from the bar at night is deafening and when the crowd spills out onto the street at closing time, it's as if the Bulls won another championship. The conversion from the Grand Ambassador East is cheap. Damaged woodwork was simply painted over, damaged electrical outlets and plates were retained, there is exposed flexible conduit running on the floor to power the AC units. Weirdly, there is no alarm clock in the room. Other random craziness ...... The carpeting is (was) white. It shoes the legacy of each and every former guest. Free dial-up speed wifi. If you want anything past one Mbps you need to pay an up charge. No bathrobe. Only two towels. And a surplus of lady bugs in the room. I suspect that anything other than a two star review is posted by en employee or a masochist.
