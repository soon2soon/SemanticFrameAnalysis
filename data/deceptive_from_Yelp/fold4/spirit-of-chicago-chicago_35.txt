We took a Spirit cruise for our wedding anniversary. The DJ was great in coming over to personally welcome us. There were rose petals awaiting us on our table. The food was very good. The dessert wAs plenty and perfect. They wrote happy anniversary on the dessert plate in chocolate.  Boating along the Chicago skyline was wonderfully refreshing atop the two decks with beautiful breezes in our face. Take a jacket for that. If you drink, buy drink tickets at the booth on navy pier beforehand---way cheaper.  We give it an A for sure.
