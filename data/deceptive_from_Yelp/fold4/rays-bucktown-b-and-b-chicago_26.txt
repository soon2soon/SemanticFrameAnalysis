I've stayed at Rays twice now for long weekend visits. Amazing both times. Some perks: The breakfast is top-notch.

There's a sauna and steam room. There's free bottled water waiting for you after a long night out or before your trip back home. No issues with finding spots for street parking. Lastly, everyone working there is wonderful
