I don't have enough good things to say about Rami and Scuba Sensations. I just finished my open water certification and all the way through the classroom sessions, the pool sessions, and then the weekend of check out dives, Rami and his crew were extremely patient, knowledgeable, and FUN. Just all around good people. I not only feel completely confident in the skills I learned with them and super excited for my upcoming dive trip, I have some wonderful people in my life I can call friends. Thank you Rami, you're the greatest. ~ #1 Â  :)
