Grrrr, A place to vent.... I flew last year and had a $118.00 credit (MY MONEY!!!!). They say it expires on March 8th 2010. ( a year from when I GAVE THEM MY MONEY!!!) So... I book a flight to Phoenix to see the Blackhawks and White Sox on Feb 12th and they say I cant use MY MONEY because I will be flying after March 8th. wait a min...expires when I purchased it but have to use on fly date, not purchase date. Boy talk about Â having it both ways!!! Again ITS MY MONEY they have been holding for me for a year!!!
