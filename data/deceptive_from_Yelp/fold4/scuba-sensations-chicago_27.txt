Owner/manager Rami Hatamleh is without a doubt, the finest SCUBA instructor that I have ever studied with.  Not only is he highly knowledgeable and patient, he clearly loves to teach.  For him teaching is not a job, but a passion.  With his flexible class scheduling, I was able to complete my course when it was convenient for me.  The personalized attention that I received was second to none.  When you add the great selection of both new and used gear coupled with the low prices, Scuba Sensations is now my one-stop SCUBA shop for all of my diving needs.
