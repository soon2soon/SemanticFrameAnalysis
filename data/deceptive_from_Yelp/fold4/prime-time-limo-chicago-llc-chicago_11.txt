My friends and I booked a reservation with this company for a bachelorette party.  We went from Downers Grove to Chicago.  We were late getting into the limo, because of one of the bride to be.  The driver was very understanding and although it says on the confirmation that they would bill us for waiting anything more than 15 minutes, they didn't.  We were worried because we had a 6:30 reservation on a Friday night, and it was already 6pm by the time we got in.  I looked at my Google Maps, and it said traffic was horrible, and it would take an hour.  The driver took some side roads at first, and we got on the highway.  We made it to the restaurant at about 6:40, and we didn't loose our reservation.  The bride to be wanted to go stay out later, and they adjusted the pickup time for us.  I knew we were a pain, and I felt horrible, I apologized, and all he asked for was a review!  So here it is!!!  Thanks so much!  We will be using your services for the wedding.
