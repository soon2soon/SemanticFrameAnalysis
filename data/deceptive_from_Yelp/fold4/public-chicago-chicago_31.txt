I won't even enter into the hotel ever in my life because the doorman won't allow me inside of the hotel to use washroom just because a drive a cab.. The funny part is when I went to pump room 2 weeks back all the staff was very nice and friendly and after a week when I again went thr just to use washroom he won't let me in..... They should understand one thing that we are human being... No matter what I do and where I work that should not matter to you.. Your hotel is a public place so u gotta respect each and every Individual in this planet.. Show equality!
