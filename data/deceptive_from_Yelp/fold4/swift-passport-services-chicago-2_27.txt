It was a terrible situation. I was printing my boarding passes in preparation  for a much anticipated trip to Bahamas and both my children's passports had expired 3 weeks ago. I thought they were 10 year renewals but minors are 5. We were supposed to fly  out the next morning at 6:00am. I found swift passport. I talked with Rob who sent all the information to me. I don't live in Chicago and I proceeded to compile all the necessary documents,go to post office, and then mail overnight. That same day the passports were completed. My family left the next day and thankfully we were able to extend our trip. Swift passport made it happen in 1 day!
