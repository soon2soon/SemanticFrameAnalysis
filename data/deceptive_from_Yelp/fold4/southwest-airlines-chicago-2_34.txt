Southwest does not care about their loyal customers. We have been earning rapid rewards throughout the year. Now with their new system, you cannot take two standard awards and make a freedom award, so essentially, it is almost impossible to find an available flight. So much for caring about your faithful customer. They deserve to see their customer base treat them, just like they have treated us---kick them to the curb!
