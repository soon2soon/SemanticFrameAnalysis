Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is located a 5-minute walk from the Chicago Avenue and metro station. 10 minutes to the waterfront of the Chicago River, with a magnificent view of the skyscrapers. When you check in ask for a room higher up - a very nice view of the city lights at night. Very helpful staff, lovely breakfast, there were only positive Â of stay
