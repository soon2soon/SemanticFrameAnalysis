DISAPPOINTED!! Old and dated, compared to other hotels in the area. I dont know how it is categorized as 4.5 star -  i think it is a 3 1/2 at the best. Location wise it is really nice as u are just steps away from Mag Mile- but that's pretty much the only positive I've seen. First, bellhops and attendants didnt even help with our luggage. Then, when we got to our room, the smell was horrible- like sewer or a dead rat- or both. We had to change rooms asap. In both rooms, cabinets are old - hanger rack placed too low that your shirt will be on the floor. Bed is only queen - u have to pay at least extra $20 to get the King bed! Furnishing are old -  TV in bedroom still a tube TV! (but a 36" flat screen in living area, though; no HD channels. Only 1 bedside table; Doors not really 'sealed' -lights from hall really leaking inside room, and you can hear pretty much conversations from people passing by the hallway. Pillows are also not comfortable. Carpet are stained. bathroom tub not full lenght- i think it's onyl about 4.5 ft long. Better spend your money elsewhere, in another nicer and newer hotel.
