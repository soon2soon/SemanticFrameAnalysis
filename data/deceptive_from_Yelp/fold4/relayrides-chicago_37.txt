I have always had good luck with RelayRides, the people are always nice and very accommodating. I like the fact you submit payment after the owner replies, which allows you the freedom to do a couple car requests in case some of them don't reply fast enough, which is huge deal for me because, usually when I need a car it is always the day of, and I need to know asap who can offer me a car.
