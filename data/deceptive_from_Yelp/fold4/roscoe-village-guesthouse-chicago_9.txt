Great location! They have a few different properties and we stayed in the main one on the top floor over Memorial Day. There is another unit below and a cute boutique below that. Perfect location for us. Walking distance to public transportation and located on a tree lined streets with plenty of restaurants and bars. David (property manager) was available for us the whole time. He always either answered right away or got back to us immediately. He definitely made our trip. We had a couple of small issues (didn't know how to switch the TV to watch a DVD and he came right over to do it for us) and he took care of them right away. The kitchen is remodeled and modern even though the building is older. Bed in the main bedroom was really comfortable although our friends couldn't say the same about the other bedroom. 2 bathrooms make it great for more than 2 people staying there. Would definitely recommend it and stay there again.
