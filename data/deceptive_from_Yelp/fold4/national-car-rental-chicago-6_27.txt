Seemless rental.  everything was as planned for.  Love the Emerald aisle feature - ended up with a Chevy Camaro!  The employees also went above and beyond when my daughter left her ipad under the seat. When we called from the terminal they went out to the car, found the ipad and sent it to us via FedEx - arrived in 2 days.  Will definitely rent from them again.
