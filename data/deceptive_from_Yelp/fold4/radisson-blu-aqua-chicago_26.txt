"A unique experience at the best hotel in town" We think you have a superb hotel, location, cleanliness, staff, courtesy, timeliness and all those small things we did not find in other Chicago's best hotels. Your hotel was recommended to us by Mr. Predrag Petkovic, with praise and assurance that we would have a great and resplendent experience. The luxury, the response of your staff, the friendliness, the entire atmosphere, and especially the fair at the business section breakfast/coffee bar on the 17th floor has to be one of the most unique experiences one could have in a highest quality hotel. The maintenance of our room and the overall efficiency of that staff was unforgettable. We thanked Mr. Petkovic profusely and assured him that we will use NO OTHER hotel whenever we visit Chicago.
