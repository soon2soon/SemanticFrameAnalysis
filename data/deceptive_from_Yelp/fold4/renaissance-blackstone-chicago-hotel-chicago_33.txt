Beautiful ambiance and we had a nice, quiet room. Two bed/two bath room and both different. One bath had no working fan, other had heat coming out of the vents, so both were steamy in August! You have to pay extra for parking. Also extra for wifi if you are not a HHonors member. There is no continental breakfast, so be prepared to pay about $20 per person for the buffet. It is good, but wow!
