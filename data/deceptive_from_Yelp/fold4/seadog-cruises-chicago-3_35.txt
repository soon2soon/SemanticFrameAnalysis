It was a very disappointing experience, because of their seating. We were supposed to reach there at 7:00 PM for the 7:15 PM tour. We reached there at 7:03 PM. The queue was huge and we got one of the last rows to sit. The engine noise was too loud and annoying, we were not able to hear anything the guide was saying. So, first 30-45 mins of the tour were utter wastage as we couldn't hear anything. Secondly, because of the little protruding roof over our seat, we were not able to see any building when the guide was talking about it. I understand it is busy season and I understand the concept of first come first serve seats, but seadog should make sure that everyone is getting the same experience (we all paid same money). If you can get a seat well in front then it might be a OK tour (I don't know, for me it was horrible). The only good thing was the last 15 mins of speed boat ride, but if I wanted that, I would have taken the "Speed Boat" Tour and not the architecture tour. I wanted to learn something about Chicago architecture, which we were not able to because of the horrible seating arrangements of Seadog. I guess they worry more about their commercial interests then joy or fun quotient of their customers. Responding to Seadog Representative's comments: Thanks for the response Elizabeth, but I had no issues with the queue or waiting for that matter. Its the inability of your BACK SEATS to be of any good at all (because of the reasons described in detail in my review). Probably the review was too long and you couldn't read it completely before responding. And no, I won't be taking any more chances with you guys. Thanks again for responding.
