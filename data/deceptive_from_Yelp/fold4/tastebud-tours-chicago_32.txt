Excellent! Having been to Chicago a few times, my wife was looking for something unique to do and discovered Tastebud Tours. It was great and we plan to take the other tours upon on our return. Owner Lynn stopped by adding an unexpected highlight and provided some history of the company coupled with a brief description of future endeavors. Our tour guide Andrew Carter (abcisme.com) did an awesome job! Andrew added a lot of historical information and was very professional and personable. We highly reccomend this experience in Chicago! The food was great! By the way, we took this tour on July 2 and I am writing this review on July 27! It was really that good.
