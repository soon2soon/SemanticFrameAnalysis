We did the architectural boat tour on a cool day, but Trooper made it enjoyable!  Trooper was very informative in a fun way on the buildings as we were going through the city.  After going through the city we went back out to the "great" lake for our speed boat part of the tour and again although really cold Trooper had fun with it!  Would defiantly recommend Seadog's boat rides and Trooper was a blast as a guide, Thanks for the fun Seadog!!
