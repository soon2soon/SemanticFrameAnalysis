I forget how I found RelayRides, I think I read about them in Wired magazine or something.  Anyway, I ended up signing up because I needed to take a quick trip to the Chicago burbs and had no desire to get a rental car and go through all the paperwork. Anyway, RelayRides was fantastic.  Simple, Easy, Intuitive, and Convenient.  No problems, no hassles, no headaches. Highly Recommend.
