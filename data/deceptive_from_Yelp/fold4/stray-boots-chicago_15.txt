My husband and I had a great time exploring the Magnificent Mile with the help of Stray Boots! I grew up in Chicago, but I learned some cool facts and got to see places up close as I haven't seen them before. There are no time constraints, so we explored shops and restaurants, ate lunch, took extra time where we wanted.
