National Car Rental has always been my preferred car rental provider after I've had some not so good experiences with other car rental companies. At MDW location, I was able to choose the vehicle I wanted from their vast choices for Emerald members. I had no issues with checkout process. Car condition was good and didn't have any trouble during my rental period. I would definitely recommend National Car Rental at MDW and other Emerald service locations.
