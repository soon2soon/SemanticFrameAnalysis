Not your average train station, It has gift shops, a shoe store, coffee houses, a book store, Bath & Bodyworks, banking, Ben & Jerrys icecream, two bars, a very nice restaurant that just opened recently, and a food court in the lower level. By the way in response to Drew's previous review, the building is not owned by Metra, it is owned by CitiCorp. Â Either way though, this is quite a step up from any train station I've been to.
