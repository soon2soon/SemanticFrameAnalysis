Great first time experience, rented a sweet convertible for the day this past Saturday, the whole ordeal was a smooth process, but at the end of the day it really depends on the person you're renting from I guess. The only thing I find a bit annoying is that, the car owner reported a defect on the car, which he of course should do. Then RelayRides suspended me until matter is resolved, as they should. However after agreeing with the car owner that we'll get this sorted between us and the car owner reported that to RelayRentals, I'm still suspended. But at the end of the day, it's a great way to rent cars, especially if you would like a specific car with certain features. As normal car rentals normally never provides the exact car you are requesting. I will continue to use RelayRides when I need a car for longer than a few hours, in those cases Zipcar makes the most sense to me.
