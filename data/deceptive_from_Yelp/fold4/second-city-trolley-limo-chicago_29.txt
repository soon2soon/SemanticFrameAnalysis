I booked a trolley for my husband's 30th birthday bar crawl. I did research before booking with Second City and their pricing was a little cheaper than other trolley companies in the city. When I called to book, they were courteous, helpful, and attentive. Paying was easy... $289 on my credit card to hold the reservation and another $289 the day before the event. One week before, I e-mailed with questions, concerns, and our itinerary. Within 2 hours, I got a reply with detailed answers. Two days before the event, we decided to change our itinerary and our changes were accommodated easily.  The day of the event, our trolley driver arrived TWENTY minutes early. Gus was so helpful and even did the heavy lifting loading the beer and drinks into the trolley. Inside, the trolley was clean and comfortable. Several friends commented that it was the nicest one they'd been on. We booked a 3 hour block of time for which we made 2 stops. Our goal was to spend as much time on the trolley listening to music and dancing.  The first stop was at Proust! in Lakeview, where we had a round of drinks and a giant pretzel. When we finished there, Gus was waiting in the trolley and welcomed us aboard as we all piled in. From there, we rode around for 45 minutes and listened to my husband's birthday playlist on the sound system. It was easy to plug his iPhone 6 into the USB cord supplied by Second City. Our next stop was Headquarters for pinball and drinks. It wasn't too busy and everyone was able to get a round of beer before we got back on the trolley for the last 45 minutes of riding. Our last stop was at O'Leary's, where most of the party got out. Gus dropped me off at home where he again helped me unload. The night was a success. I'm so happy with my experience with Second City and highly recommend this company!
