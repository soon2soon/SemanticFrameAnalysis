I am delighed to leave this review. NM Car Service was the best private car service I have used. I travel a lot for business and pleasure and have utilized various forms of ground transportation over the years. This, by far, is the greatest. The owner, Neil, is fantastic as a driver, and has a wonderful personality. Bernie, another driver, was equally great and fun to work with. If you are ever in the Chicago/Oakbrook area, PLEASE give him a try. Very reasonably priced for door to door (curb to curb) service. We had a party of four (finicky) women, and ALL were very, very happy and impressed with the on-time service, the clean vehicles, and the professional drivers. I will defintely call on NM Car Service again for my transportation needs. Â  Thank you Neil for getting the job done right!
