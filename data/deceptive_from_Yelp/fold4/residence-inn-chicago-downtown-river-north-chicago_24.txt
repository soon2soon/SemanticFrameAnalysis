I stayed at this hotel over memorial day weekend for two nights. The hotel itself was pretty nice and the rooms small, but clean.  The real problem with the hotel is the customer service though.   On the second night of my stay, my car was broken into while using the hotel' garage. Hotel management would do nothing to compensate me, other than take the parking off the bill.  In speaking with the garage staff, I learned that car break ins are common, in fact, three happened that day.  No mention was made of this when checking in, or I may have parked elsewhere.  Further, the manager Sean, did not even to help vacuum the broken glass from my car or assist me in finding a window replacement.  I was forced to drive home 6 hours without a window and sour taste in my mouth from the poor response.   I would discourage people from staying here due to the lack of regard they have for  guests.  No one deserves this type of treatment when staying in a hotel, far from home.
