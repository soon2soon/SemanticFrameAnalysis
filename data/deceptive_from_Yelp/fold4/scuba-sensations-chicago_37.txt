Rami, the operator of Scuba Sensations, provides the best combination of experience, teaching skills and fun that you are going to find around.  You really LEARN when you take a course with Rami, and have a great time doing it.  And when it comes to dive travel, I've been someone who mostly traveled alone or with one dive buddy and avoided organized group trips.  I took my first group trip last year with Rami and every single person had a fantastic time and each attributed it to Rami's handling of things and electric personality.   Now I have two more booked with him in the coming months and can't wait!   He's also offering trips to some more "off the beaten path" type locations, which is great for those always looking to try something different.
