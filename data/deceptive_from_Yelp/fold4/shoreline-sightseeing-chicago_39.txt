My friend and I went and had an amazing time. The tour guide, Jim, was super knowledgable about the architects and buildings, passionate about Chicago and providing a memorable time, and entertaining by cracking jokes and being super upbeat and friendly. He makes the experience totally worth every penny, and he gives you super great recommendations for things to do around the city... Ask what time slots he is covering if you go! We always felt safe during the entire voyage, and really appreciated the clear instructions and care the crew demonstrated. We also had a small break where we went down and grabbed a drink, and were pleasantly surprised at the wide and fairly priced selection. The city of Chicago is so beautiful, and I was able to appreciate it so much more with the knowledge, history, and the fun experience Shoreline Sightseeing provided.
