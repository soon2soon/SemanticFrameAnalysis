We had a decent experience, but we also knew what we were in for due to planning and some prior experience by a member of our fam. The cost of the room itself isn't what you should budget for as they hit you on fees on everything from parking to wifi. The hotel food is generally not recommended so it doesn't hurt to budget on some of the great food down either street instead. I'd highly recommend going with the executive floors/rooms as they have the express elevator. In the end if you're not big on the history or a fan of older places and their quirks, there are options that may appeal to you more. Overall we had a great stay and a great time due to the location benefits and not really caring about the quirks. I can't imagine the chaos of staying in the other rooms though with the elevator madness on top of the lobby madness, which other reviewers accurately complained is a bit like grand central. The staff seemed perpetually overwhelmed, so if there was a problem with the room (not unlikely in such an old building, but fortunately something we avoided) it may not get addressed in a timely fashion or at all depending on how long you're there and/or when it comes up. It's certainly not a place for everybody and if you're on a budget I highly recommend doing some research on the fees and such here and at other places well in advance so you can decide with the most information. We had a great time, but we knew what we were in for, planned ahead, and weighed the pros and cons and also didn't run into any troubles. Your experience may vary. I really hope it doesn't though... it can be a great place with so many great food options nearby and the location can be awesome depending on your itinerary. Especially if you have access to the executive/express elevators when you're a smoker.;)
