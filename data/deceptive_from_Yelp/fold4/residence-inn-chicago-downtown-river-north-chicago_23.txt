I stayed at the Residence Inn last night (March 1) and it was a wonderful stay. The room was beautiful. I would give them a over all rating of 5 stars. The problem is when I got home and found a BED BUG crawling on my chin from climbing out of my sweater. I definitly didn't have bed bugs before I came to the Residence Inn. So please please be careful and check the room/bed before you stay. Aka I was in Room 1401.
