I did this tour with 2 friends, all of us in our late 20's/early 30's. I wasn't very excited when we signed up, but my friend had her heart set on it. I was wrong. This was actually the best "tourist" thing we did. The bartender was great, best pina colada's I've had in a long time. Boat was comfortable enough, and had great sightlines. The best part by far was our tour guide Sarah. She was hiliarous. A great mix of information, family friendly fare, and a few risque jokes that flew right over the kids heads and had my friends I almost falling off the boat laughing. Highly recommend this one!
