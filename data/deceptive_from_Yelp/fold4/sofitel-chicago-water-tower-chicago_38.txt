I got an awesome last minute deal on getaroom.com. I wish I had more time during the year to travel to Chicago. (I have two friends and three cousins who live there.) The hotel's location is convenient (near Magnificent Mile) and the on-site staff is always warm. The hotel has a very swanky feel to it even though the rates are more than reasonable. Seems like a great place to hold a wedding/business conference. The only downside was that the hotel was a bit crowded.
