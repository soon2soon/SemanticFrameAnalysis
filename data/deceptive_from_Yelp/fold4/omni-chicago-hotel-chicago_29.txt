Great hotel.  The staff, from registration to the valets, provided outstanding service.  Everything was not perfect but they tried to fix it.  If you are downtown Chicago give this hotel a try.  Pricey...yes.  Four star hotels generally are, but you get what you pay for at this establishment.  Thank you for a great weekend.  Oh.  Try the burgers here...yum!
