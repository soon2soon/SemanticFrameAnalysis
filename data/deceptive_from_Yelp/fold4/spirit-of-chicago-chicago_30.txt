We wanted to have a small wedding with less than 25 people and looked into the Spirit of Chicago for our ceremony and reception. The wedding coordinators, Carrie Dunn and Susan Malen were professional, friendly and accommodated all of our needs. Everyone had a wonderful and truly memorable experience. Our party boarded the ship an hour before the rest of the ships guests. Our guests were escorted to the top deck of the ship seated for our ceremony. Everyone was then escorted to our seating area for a beautiful buffet. My floral centerpieces were displayed beautifully on all of our tables and the wedding cake was perfectly displayed in our section.Our party was able to dish up and find seating well before others were allowed to board. The DJ and entertainment staff kept the excitement alive throughout the cruise. It was a seamless and enjoyable experience. I absolutely recommend using the Spirit of Chicago if you don't want the hassle of piecing a wedding together. It was an inexpensive and completely stress free wedding. We were very happy with our entire wedding experience.
