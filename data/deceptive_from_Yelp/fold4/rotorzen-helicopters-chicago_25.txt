Definitely something to put on your bucket list: and remember...your not getting any younger. The views were great of the city and the pilot, Eric, has many, many years flying experience. It was better than a day at the amusement park. No lines, finished in a perfect amount of time and more thrilling and memorable than any ride. Will do again!
