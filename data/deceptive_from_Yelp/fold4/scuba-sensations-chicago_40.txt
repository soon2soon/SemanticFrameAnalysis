I have known and done business with Rami for several years, both when he managed a dive shop and now that he has opened Scuba Sensations. He has always been very professional, whether selling me equipment, answering questions or planning trips. He realizes that satisfied customers are happy, and he is much more interested in seeing that your needs are met than in selling you sometihng you don't really need or want. Above all, Rami realizes that scuba diving is recreation, so his priority is to see that his customers have fun! Â Whether in shop social activities, trip, classes or whatever, Rami makes you glad that you are a diver - and isn't that what it's all about?
