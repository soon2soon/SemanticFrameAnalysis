I rented their Club Hopper Party Bus for my birthday celebration for a Saturday night. From the first call,  customer service was great, great prices, punctual, what you see is exactly what you get, overall best choice in regards to limo/party bus rental. Jim Wilson was great to work with from the beginning and throughout the contract process, answered ALL my questions since it was first time I inquired about this type of service. He was great and turned out to be the driver for the night. Very accommodating as well. Bus was exactly as in the pic and clean. My folks had tons of fun, will definitely use this company again in the future!  Recommend it!
