These guys saved my bacon. I had lost my passport. Actually, the Brazilian Consulate lost my passport. I sent it in for a Brazilian visa and after 30 days I found out they lost it. I was to be in London for 10 days and then go on to Rio on business. No visa/passport made this very difficult! I met Swift downtown on a Sunday evening after flying from Kansas City. They set me up with a hotel and met me going over my loss passport application. On Monday, they had my new passport and I made my flight to London that evening. Unfortunately, I was still obviously without the Brazilian visa. I sent my passport to Swift Via FedEx from London to their offices in Chicago. They took care of the Brazilian visa and had the passport sent back to me FedEx to London in plenty of time to make my London flight to Rio. when I got the Rio, my brand-new passport with my Brazilian visa was stolen! Right out of my hotel room! I went to the American consulatein they gave me enough paperwork to board the flight to get home. Now I am back to Swift for another replacment passport and Brazilan Visa ! thank you Swift for everything the services doing great and I appreciate all you are doing for me.
