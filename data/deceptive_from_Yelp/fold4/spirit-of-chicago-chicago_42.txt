Our boss took the office out for a lunch cruise.  Didn't know what to expect, but as soon as you walked in, realized that this was going to be a nice dining experience.  If your over 6ft tall watch your head though when you are entering the boat from the deck.  Great wait staff service. Our server was Lianne, and she was very hospitable, and at one point offered to bring my drink to where ever I was on the boat.  I thought that was cool.  The staff even sings and entertains as a group.  The buffet was great, and they left it out the whole time.  They gave you time to eat, before the boat left the dock, which gives you time to enjoy the food with out missing the scenery.  They have an open deck on two floors so you can enjoy the couches, and tables, and enjoy the fresh air and wind.  Great experience. Thanks to my boss, otherwise I would never experienced dining on a boat.  Oh and don't touch the paper confetti things on your table, they will instruct you to do something with them during the entertainment.   LIANNE - Thank You!
