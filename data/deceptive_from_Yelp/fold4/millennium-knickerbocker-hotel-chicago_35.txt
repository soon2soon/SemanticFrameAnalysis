Nice location near all the attractions. Parking is pretty rough, but once you're parked, you can walk, cab, or take public transit nearly anywhere. Amenities are fine; a few too many cosmetic problems for a fancy hotel. Charging for internet access? Well, that's just plain cheap--you lost half a star just for that. If I had it to do over, I would have spent a little more $$$ on a more modern place.
