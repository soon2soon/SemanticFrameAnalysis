So. while it was incredibly hot (upper 90's) the air conditioning in the lobby was not working properly, nor was the air conditioning in the room.  We asked for a fan and did receive one, but none the less the experience was less than pleasant! They did cut our room rate in half, which was nice, but I would have rather paid full price for a lovely room.  The bathrooms are nice, but sinks, while trendy or very small!  and to top it off, the coffee maker did not work in the room.  Might be a nice place in the spring or fall, but not so much in the heat of the summer!
