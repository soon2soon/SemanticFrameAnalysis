I've stayed here before on business, but after this last visit, I'll be staying at a different hotel. Overall, the rooms are a decent size and relatively comfortable. The convenience of the location is great for my business dealings. However, for some ungodly reason, they think pumping fake pine smell into the air is festive. It's not. I had constant headaches. My asthma, which is very well controlled, was irritated. When I complained to the front desk about this, it was laughed off. The scent is so strong that when you are a half block away from the hotel entrance you can still smell it! Obviously, the hotel doesn't care that some of its patrons might have upper respiratory ailments or allergies. I truly feel sorry for staff that need to work in that environment. Next trip I'll be at the Intercontinental.
