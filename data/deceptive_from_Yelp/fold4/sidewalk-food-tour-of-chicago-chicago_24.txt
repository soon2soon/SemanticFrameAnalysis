The Wicker Park Foodie Walking Tour was the one of the best things we did on our trip to Chicago. The tour is a comfortable walk through the neighbourhood, provides great insight into the past and current history of the area, and offers you a good sampling of eateries. Our guide, Aaron, was great. He not only provided details and facts based on the tour group's research but also had some personal insight and stories about the area. His interaction with everyone on the tour was genuine and made you feel comfortable to have a conversation or ask questions on any topic.  It was also noticed that proprietors and staff at all our stops were glad see Aaron. This made it feel as though Aaron was truly a local and he was just dropping in with some new found friends and introduce them to some great food offerings. A recommendation would be to schedule this tour early into you vacation as it will provide you so many more things to do in this neighbourhood during your stay in Chicago.  We left it to the end of our stay and kicked ourselves as we wanted to go back for a meal or just to take in more of what the neighbourhood had to offer. Best we could do was to get some take-out orders for our trek home. We'll definitely make sure we schedule the River North Tour on our next trip to Chicago! Thanks again Aaron.
