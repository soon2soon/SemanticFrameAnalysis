We took the architectural tour that departed from Navy Pier. It's an open boat so I think you can get a good view from most anywhere you sit and it is also equipped with a bar and nice clean restrooms. Our guide, Victor, was great; giving us non stop facts, trivia, opinion, and inside information from the community and neighborhood meetings he has attended. His passion for architecture and particularly Chicago really make an already interesting tour more enjoyable. Whether you're from Chicago or just visiting, this tour should definitely be on your list of things to do.
