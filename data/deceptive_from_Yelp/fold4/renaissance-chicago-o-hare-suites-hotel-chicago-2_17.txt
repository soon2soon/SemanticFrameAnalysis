This is my favorite business-travel hotel in the U.S., period.  (I stay in more than 30 different hotels a year, and average 220-230 hotel-nights a year.) Beds -- excellent Huge walk-in showers -- can't be beat, they are fantastic Big, comfortable, perfectly quiet rooms -- none of those awful doors between suites that leak the sound of your neighbor's in-room movie at 2 am.  Hallway doors seal, and no sound of people slamming the doors at midnight. Perfectly clean and maintained Convenient to O'Hare, the L, the Interstate Starbucks in the lobby (if only it would stay open late at night) Staff is top-notch Shuttle service to airport every 30 min, or to area restaurants
