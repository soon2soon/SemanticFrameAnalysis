I went on a girls Chicago trip earlier this week and this was our only planned activity. I was drawn in by the Living Social price and lack of effort needed on our part. We chose the River North tour because of it's proximity to our hotel. We showed up and had a BLAST! Our guide was Aaron who just happened to make the tour awesome! The stories, history of certain areas, and architectural information was more than I expected. Each place had a great item to taste and the pace allowed for sitting at several of the stops. I look forward to going on the Wicker Park tour later this year.
