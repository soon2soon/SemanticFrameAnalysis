I had a family gathering in Chicago and came across Roscoe Village Guesthouse during my search for a place to stay.  Roscoe Village Guesthouse was perfect because it could accommodate our entire group.  We stayed in two properties, five suites.  The suites were beautifully decorated and very clean.  I slept great, as the bed was extremely comfortable.  The guesthouse was just a short walk from several great restaurants with outdoor seating and shops.  The times we didn't feel like going out to eat we had the convenience of preparing our own meals since all of the units had full kitchens.  I highly recommend staying at Roscoe Village Guesthouse and will definitely stay again!
