What a Romantic Afternoon My husband surprised me with a luncheon cruise. We had a wonderful time. We got to Navy Pier a little early and enjoyed the pier while waiting to board the ship. When it was time to board we were greeted warmly by the stall and escorted to our table. My husband had picked the sweetheart package and we had 6 roses and petals on the table and a bottle of champagne. The buffet was very good and the view from on board the boat was wonderful. The Chicago skyline is beautiful. The singers and dancers were good and a lot of fun, the DJ played our favorite song and everyone was up and dancing having a wonderful time. Would go back in a New York minute, and probably will.
