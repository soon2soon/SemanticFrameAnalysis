Back from a business trip and my buddy planned on picking me up from O'Hare. He got tied up but gave me a phone number for a ride with a company that he had a good experience with. I call the number and am greeted by by the owner of the business. She tells me that she doesn't have any drivers in the area, but she can be there herself to pick me up. We agree upon the rate and I hardly have to wait before my ride arrives. The owner introduces herself as Irina and, as a previous review has said, she is quite the lovely Eastern European woman. She quickly takes me to where I need to go and I arrived earlier than I thought I would have. Irina was very friendly and was very easy to talk to. I was so engrossed in our conversation that I didn't even realize that we arrived at my destination. Glad my friend bailed on me!
