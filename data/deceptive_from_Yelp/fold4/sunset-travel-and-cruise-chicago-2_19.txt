Martha-the trip was awesome!!! We had an absolute blast!  St John was so beautiful and St Thomas kept us on the go with lots to do there!  Just wanted to thank you for helping us with the trip and I have recommended you to many of my friends so you may hear from them next time they are looking to take a trip.  I plan on doing business in the future with you! Thanks again Michael G
