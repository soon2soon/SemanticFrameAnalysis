We had a great tour! We went to several places, some are historical places with stunning views. I enjoyed the whole time our guide allows us to buy stuff along the way. I'd definitely recommend Tastebud Tour to anyone visiting Chicago. The tour guide is very friendly. I enjoyed talking to Lynn, he gave us many unique facts about Chicago, and some amazing history of some of the restaurants we ate at.
