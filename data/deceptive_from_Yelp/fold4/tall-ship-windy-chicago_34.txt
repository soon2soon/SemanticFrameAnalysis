We went on two cruises last week.  My 20-something son and I enjoyed them fully.   The first cruise was delayed for 45 minutes due to bad weather.  A docent entertained us for that time with information about living on the ship, different places the ship had been, and unusual bits of information.  Once we could set sail, it was lovely. The second cruise was the Aaarghitecture tour which I enjoyed because the docent had many interesting tidbits about Chicago that I had never heard before.  That was refreshing (as was the breeze) because I've gone a 2 other tours of the city on past trips. I found the staff to be very pleasant and well-informed. CONS: We made our registrations online and later found a 2 for 1 coupon in a magazine which we unfortunately couldn't use. Snacks were skimpy and expensive - but that wasn't unexpected.
