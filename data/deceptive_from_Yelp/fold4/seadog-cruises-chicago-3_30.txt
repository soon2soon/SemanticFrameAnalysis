What a perfect day on the Seadog on Saturday June 30th. I took 46 of my family members from Israel, Canada, China, Australia and the US on a wonderful city cruise. All my adult and kid cousins raved about the boat, staff and perfect weather. The corporate staff person that helped me arrange this tour was A+... Thanks to Seadog for making our Saturday a great day on Lake Michigan.. Susan (Glenview, IL)
