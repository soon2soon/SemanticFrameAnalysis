The move of the car rentals away from Midway Airport is a mistake that causes significant additional wasted time in getting a rental car. During this rental I wasted an additional 20 minutes exiting the National Car Rental floor of the new facility due to the length of time it takes for National to process their customers as customers exit through their limited gates. Overall a very poor customer experience.
