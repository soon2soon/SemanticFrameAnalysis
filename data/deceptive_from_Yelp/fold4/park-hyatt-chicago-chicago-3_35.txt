such an awesome hotel with an awesome view. the staff is amazing. they helped my now fiance arrange everything for the proposal at the Signature room, they knew us both by name and the company car was awesome and helped us get arround. such a great location, right on the magnificent mile so we got to go shopping. i def want to go there again soon.
