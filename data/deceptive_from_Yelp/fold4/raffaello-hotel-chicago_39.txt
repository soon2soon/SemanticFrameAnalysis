My wife and I loved the Raffaello.  We stayed there for the first time over 4th of July weekend.  This rating could very easily have been a 5.  The hotel is an older building very nicely updated to create a great hotel.  The room was great. Plenty of space, nice dresser with lots of storage for those who like to unpack. Nice flat-panel TV.  But the best things are the linens and pillows on the bed.  Very comfortable.  My wife also loved the in-room hair dryer. Plenty of power and good controls.  The bathroom was great, with a separate vanity area, so we could both primp before our nights out.  Everything is nicely decorated. Why not a 5 rating?  Small things.  No bath fan.  Nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. No tub.  No view.  Other than that, we loved the place and will be back!
