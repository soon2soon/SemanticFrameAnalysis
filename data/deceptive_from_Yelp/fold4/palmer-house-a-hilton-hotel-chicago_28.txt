This hotel has some good history and a beautiful lobby when you walk in. The price you have to pay for parking and the type of room you get don't match at all. Parking overnight is almost 70 dollars per night... And the rooms match a standard Hilton hotel. Quite a let down from what I was anticipating. Service was good all around and again the lower level of the hotel was amazing, unfortunately that's about 10% of the visit. I would go again, but wouldn't park and would have to be a discounted rate.
