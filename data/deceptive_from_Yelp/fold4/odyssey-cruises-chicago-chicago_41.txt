I attended a wedding on the Odyssey.  Everything was nice, except the extremely rude bartenders.  Anytime anyone wanted a drink it would take 20 mins because they only had two bartenders for 250 people.  Then when asking for a typical Tequila Sunrise we were told "I have made to many of those tonight, I am not going to make anymore".  Or multiple people were turned down multiple times for being accused of drinking two much.  This was happening to people of all ages.  The gentleman next to me, around 60 years, asked for a Jack neat.  The bartender denied him claiming it was a shot.  On top of the slow and lack of service the bartenders had a huge attitude.  Had it been my wedding I would not have paid for that service. Because of this horrible experience I will never give the Odyssey any of my money for time.
