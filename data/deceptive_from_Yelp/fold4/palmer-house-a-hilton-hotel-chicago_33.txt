FILTHY DUMP, DO NOT STAY. I am a frequent traveler and Diamond member. SHOWER HAD PUBIC HAIRS. Staff did not clean it from previous guests. Asked for it to be cleaned three times but never did. When I complained, they gave me two sets of slippers and offered me free water and breakfast, which I already get. POWER OUTLETS DIDN'T WORK. Never staying again.
