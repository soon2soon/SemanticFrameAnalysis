My students had an excellent time. Many of them had never been on a boat and some had never even been to Navy Pier. The free picture was a great added touch and the buffet was more than to their liking. We had the best time and a lot said they wish to go again. It was excellent for an 8th grade luncheon. My only suggestion if possible, widen the dance floor and on the ceasar salad leave the dressing on the side.
