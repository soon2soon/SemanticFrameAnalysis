What a great experience! I was looking for help with booking a trip for my 30th Birthday. I was unsure at first of where to go, but set up an appointment with Ryan. Not only did we look and talk about my options but he gave me reading material to take home and decide. Soon I decided on Italy and booking was painless. Ryan was prompt in his responses as well as very helpful with all my questions/concerns about traveling alone. About 2 weeks before I left, his manager sent me an email of restaurant recommendations for each city I would be visiting which was great to have! This way I didn't feel so lost since I was traveling alone. Ryan also helped me book all my tours from here, which was great...it saved me lots of time and headaches. When I arrived to pick up my documents, everything was in perfect order and was explained to me in detail. It was the best 2 weeks of my life and all went as planned! I made all my connectiones and tours with no problems. Ryan is wonderful to work with! I am already looking forward to booking again with Sunset for my next overseas trip!
