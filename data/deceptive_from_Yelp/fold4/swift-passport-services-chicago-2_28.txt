If you are looking for help with a passport, use Swift! I traveled to Bulgaria in November 2012 and waited until a few weeks before the trip to get a new passport. I called Swift and they recommended 10 day service. Upon completing my part of the equation and dropping off the paperwork at Swift, I had my passport in hand two days later! Plus, they called and said they were down the street from where I work and dropped it off. Unbelievable. I'd imagine that it is not always like that but wow was it easy for me.
