Suite Home Chicago is amazing. The apartment was located on E. Wacker, which is a great location. The balcony was huge with a beautiful view of the city and Lake Michigan. The apartment included all essentials, such as dish soap, laundry detergent, paper towels, and a wide variety of kitchen utensils. In addition, the amenities are wonderful. There is a spacious workout room with a great view of the city, a sauna, stream room, hot tub, lounge, and business rooms. The apartment felt like home, warm and cozy. My favorite part was the comfort of the beds. I slept amazing and the interior design was modernized and well-coordinated. I highly recommend Suite Home Chicago!! You will be impressed.
