My girlfriends and I went on a girls weekend and decided to stay at this hotel. Let me say I was not impressed and very disappointed. First day our toilet clogged I called the front dest and they told me she will send someone right away, 20 mins passed, 30 mins passed. I finally got frustrated and called the front dest back and "no sense of urgency". After I called it still look another 15 mins for someone to come up. Really??? The next day omg, the toilet clogged again I called the front dest and what do you think happened??? Same thing as before. Never once did they ask if we wanted to switch rooms. On Sunday morning I called the front dest asking for some kcups for the coffee machine, since I never got a new batch, we waiting 30 plus minutes. Finally we were so frustrated we just decided to go down to the lobby. We got to the lobby looking for complimentary coffee, oh no such thing at a 4plus star hotel. I got tired of waiting, I hop into a cab to head down the street to get coffee at walgreens.  My complimentary coffee was $8 including cab ride. To top it all off, the hotel had 2 water dispenser at the front entrance for guest. I was sitting at the amuse having my $8 coffee as I noticed a mom with her kids trying to get some water from the dispenser, the only problem was both dispensers were emptied. I walk over to the many  hotel staff standing around and told her the water was emptied. She proceeded to fill the dispensers. Really??? Quality assurance, come on now your guest should not be asking you to fill the water dispenser at a 4plus star hotel.  I was better off staying at the holiday inn. When I go back to Chicago, this will NOT be on my list of places to stay. I'm disappointed swissotel!!! Lets fix it!!     Serenah
