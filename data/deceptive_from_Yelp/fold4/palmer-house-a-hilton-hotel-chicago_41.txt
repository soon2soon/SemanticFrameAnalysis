If I could give the NY Eve party less than one star I would.  We paid for VIP tickets and by 10:20 determined we would not get a drink until 11, because the lines for the bar were so long and were not moving.  Woefully understaffed for the number of people there.  We ended up buying drinks and food at the lobby bar!! This was after waiting thru the long VIP buffet line, only to find several empty dishes -- all that was there was GRILLED CHEESE and PIZZA!  I could not believe my eyes.  They advertised a special VIP buffet line and encouraged you not to eat ahead of time -- what a joke! Total FALSE advertising. On top of food and drink situation, they had staff busy "controlling" the crowd.  A whole one elevator took hundreds of people to the different floors. We tried to take the stairs, only to find them blocked off!  We had to walk up and down the FIRE ESCAPE stairs!?!  Is THIS how a high class hotel treats its guests??? Is THIS the "most sophisticated party in Chicago?"  Not. We had a better time at the bar.  Unbelievable and absolute WASTE of money.
