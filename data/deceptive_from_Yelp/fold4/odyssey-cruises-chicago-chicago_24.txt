I've been living in Chicago for over 20 years and finally had a good reason to go on the 3 hr. dinner cruise (my 2 yr. wedding anniversary!). I had a great time and amazing waitress: May! I was recommended to sit at one of her tables by a friend and wow! May was so attentive, she would go find you to deliver your drinks, she had great tips on where and when to take nice photos without a big crowd behind you and she was an amazing photographer snapping away! The DJ was also very uplifting; he would dance to anything and was very pleasing. They really involved the people celebrating anything special or romantic moments like putting flower petals on the tables of people celebrating anniversaries. I was very surprised by the treatment and energy on the dance floor! The DJ was great and highly entertaining. I would recommend it to my friends and the sweet table was delicious!
