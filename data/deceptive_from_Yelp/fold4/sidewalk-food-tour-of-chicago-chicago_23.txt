I just went on this River North food tour this afternoon and had a blast. Our tour guide was hilarious and incredibly knowledgeable about Chicago history and fun facts about the city. We went to 5 different restaurants, all of which were delicious and fairly timely with our food. My friend and I went to the tour thinking we would most likely need to eat after, but because we went to only 5 locations, our portions were bigger than expected and were filling enough to tie us over until dinner. Overall a great experience- highly recommend, even if you live in the city like me. Looking into Wicker Park next!
