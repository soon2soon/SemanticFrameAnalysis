Lobby - awesome setting, modern. Staff is nice and helpful. The actual reason you're going for (the room) - not so much. Maybe because I had booked it through Hotel Tonight (which is a great app, by the way), but it seemed like since it was a discount - the room shouldn't be so great. What bugged me was the windowsill that was all cracked up without any intention to clean it up a bit. It was clean, by the way. It certainly looked like a room that hasn't been used in a while - for discounted rates/last resort kind of room. I would not reccomend to someone looking for somewhere to stay in Chicago. Actual price does not match up with quality.
