Historic and wonderful property....go more upscale and forget the conventions. I say room service placesettings sit out for 1.5 day, really? Loockwood is a wonderful fine/upscale place to eat. Once again, the Palmer House is a wonderful property. As a Hilton Diamond member, more expectations and any local pubs are down right low cale, yuck! I even found other guests clothes in my wardrobe. Not a nice thing to be greated too.
