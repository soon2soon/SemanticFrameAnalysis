This was one of the biggest highlights of my trip to Chicago and when I make it back, there is no doubt in my mind I will be back. When I was there I got the Go Chicago Card and it was included. Just a breathtaking view of the coastlines and if you love ships (or a history geek) like me, this is a must! Windy is a beautiful 4 masted tall ship which actually does run solely on the strength of the wind (unless the wind isn't blowing strong) and gives you an amazing view of the coastline. For the history geeks, stay on the main deck and chat up with the hilarious Redbeard. For ours, he brought out a big box of random things used on a ship and had the crowd guess what the heck they are. He had some very hilarious stories. And if you're not into that, no worries! Get yourself a drink below decks and sit back at the bow or stern of the ship and just enjoy the view.
