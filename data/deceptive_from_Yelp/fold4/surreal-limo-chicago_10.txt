I was super impressed with this company! The man I  spoke to was James he was very nice and he answered all of my questions no matter what time it was! Also it was my first time even being on a party bus so I really didn't know what to expect...It was AMAZING!!! Not only was it affordable  The bus looked just like the picture! All of my friends were so impressed they loved it! When we pulled up to the club all eyes were on us  The driver(Antonio) was very professional and nice. I will be using this company again very soon!
