When staying in Chicago, it is hard to beat the location of the Omni. Right on The Magnificent Mile, surrounded by shops and restaurants, there is something for everyone. The hotel is an all suite hotel, and we had an amazing view from our room on the 25th floor. I have stayed at many Omnis (and worked there as well!), so that is why I was somewhat disapointed... The room could have used a little TLC, the staff was a little OTL (billing issues, missing amenities, etc...) That being said, it was still an excellent stay, and we will be back! Make sure you sign up for the Select Guest program!! Free wifi, water and morning beverages delivered to your room!
