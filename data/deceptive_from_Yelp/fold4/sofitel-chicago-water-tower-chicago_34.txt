Sofitel Chicago Water Tower an event at the hotel and I stayed here three nights total. Since the company was footing the bill I can't speak to the 'value vers cost' but the overall experience was wonderful. Employees were friendly and helpful. The entire facility was pristine and comfortable. It was a real treat to stay here.
