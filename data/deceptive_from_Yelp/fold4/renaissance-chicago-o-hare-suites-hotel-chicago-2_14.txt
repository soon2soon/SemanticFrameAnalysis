I don't know where the others have stayed before but this Hotel is dated, worn and smells.  The pullout couch in the living room had a 1" thick mattress,  There were rips in the couch and chair, We decided to move to another room with even worse results.   The staff was very nice and tried to accommodate us but all they really could do was apologize We had just come from the Fairfield INN another Marriott hotel in downtown Chicago and that was awesome.  We are premium members with Marriott and hope they  upgrade this property soon ALSO BEWARE IF YOU PREPAY THE RATE YOU CAN'T MOVE OR GET A REFUND
