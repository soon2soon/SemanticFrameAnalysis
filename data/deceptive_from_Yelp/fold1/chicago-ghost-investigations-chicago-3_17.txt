My daughter and I had a great experience hunting ghosts.   The location was not difficult to find (even without a GPS); within walking distance from China town. We had fun shopping a few hours before our adventure.   I was a skeptical at first, but when I got to hold the Dowsing Rods myself, I did not feel I was making them move (although I do believe some of the movement comes from the person holding them, I don't feel all of the moves the rods were making were coming from me).   We heard many ghosts come through a radio scanner.  I was skeptical of this too, but found that the words that did came through were loud and clear and the group could detect and decipher them as a whole.   If I could have changed one thing, I would have been more prepared with questions to ask  of the ghosts that visited us.  I was caught off-guard by how many ghosts were there wanting to converse!   This was a great adventure Funniest thing was when we were talking about leaving our ghost asked us to "Come back often!"
