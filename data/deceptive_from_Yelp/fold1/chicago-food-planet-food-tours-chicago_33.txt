This was the first food tour my wife and I had ever been on and we did not know what to expect.  We had a great time and went in to neighborhoods and businesses we would not have gone to on our own.  We had a great time, tried some new things, went back to three of the stops for meals or gift items.  It was great highly recommend it.  Plan to do another one when we are back in Chicago.
