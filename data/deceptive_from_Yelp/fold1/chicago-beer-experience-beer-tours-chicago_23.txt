I had my dad and his wife in for the weekend. They're not big drinkers so I was worried about taking them on the tour. Everyone ended up having a great time. It was crazy hot out, but all the places were air conditioned which was a big plus. Our guide, Ariana, had a great personality and really made the tour pop. The tour took us to Vaughn's Pub, Paddy Longs, Bodega Ramos, and Delilah's. At Paddy Longs there was a bacon tasting with each beer. My wife and I don't eat bacon so they gave us some veggies and hummus. All the beers were great and there was a lot of good history on the tour. My least favorite place would have to be Delilah's. I didn't care for the dark/dingy atmosphere. I probably liked Paddy Longs the best. I would recommend the tour to anyone looking for a good afternoon activity. Although, I wouldn't do it if you have a big night planned afterward. Maybe I'm a lightweight, but I was pretty wiped afterward.
