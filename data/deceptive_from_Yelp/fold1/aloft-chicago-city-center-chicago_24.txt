I used Aloft to block some rooms for my guests for my recent wedding and it worked out great. Even the skeptical relatives who, at first glance, thought the hotel was perhaps a bit too modern or "funky" for them were won over by the very comfortable beds and overall look and experience. It was a breeze working with them and they gave us a good deal. Plus it is situated in a great spot for nightlife and dining, and allowed dogs. Only cons are the pricey food and parking, but that is downtown Chicago in a nutshell.
