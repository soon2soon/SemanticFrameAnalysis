The Chicago Architecture Foundation . It offers regular for such type of the venue Chicago Architecture Foundation shows which are interesting and educational. The Chicago Architecture Foundation I believe is closed on Mondays. However, the best part of the trip for me was the view of the city you can have from the balcony like walkway surrounding the Observatory. Especially on a windy day or right after the rain, the view of the Chicago, IL basin is breathtaking. You can park the car and walk around the observatory taking wonderful photos. Then you can go up in the opposite direction for a bit for really nice view of the Chicago Architecture Foundation sign. It is a must for anyone who visits Chicago, IL.
