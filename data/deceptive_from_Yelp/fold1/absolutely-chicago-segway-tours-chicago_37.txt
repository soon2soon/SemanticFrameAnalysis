Just returned to Michigan from Chicago and must say  our segway tour with Molly as our guide was just AWESOME.  It was extremely breezy and very beautiful.  I love the city and I feel the segway tours are the ONLY way to tour a big city! I am telling EVERYONE I know to try it- at least once and see how much fun it is!  Thanks again Molly!
