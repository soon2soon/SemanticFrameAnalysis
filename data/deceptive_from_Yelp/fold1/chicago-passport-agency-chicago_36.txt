My wife and I are on our way to Panama in one week and I must have thrown out my passport when I cleaned my filing cabinets (diligently done at least once a decade). I checked this site and the .gov site and made sure I had my "ducks in a row." Trying to get an appointment was a joke. One available in 45 min., when I live 90 min. from downtown, in Munster, In. and the next available one day after my flight leaves. After waiting and wading through robotic voicemail hell, I said Â "**&%" it honey, we're going down there and get this done. I had LOST my damn passport...this was not an application or renewal ( I had gotten this one a little over a year ago at the Embassy in Guatemala City (which took nearly a week). Big time security to get in the building but, thankfully no rubber gloves or cavity searches. In the Passport office on 18---NO PHONES, Boomboxes, dancing, but you can converse or read a book after the first window, where you get checked to make sure "your Papers Are In Order." Then you have a number, it's a short wait, pleasant and when your number comes up...wonder of wonders...an efficient and well-run operation with pleasant staff. Living most of my time in Central America, I am jaded by the thought of government interaction. It's an all day thing just to sell a car or buy a scooter, not to mention the morditas (bribes) which you won't have to pay here. I am an expat disenchanted with much about this country. I love my country and it's people but really mistrust the government. All in all, I am tremendously relieved. $195.00 total and I pick up my new 52 page "businessman's" passport anytime after 1PM tomorrow. The commercial guys charge that alone plus all the government's fees on top. YOU can do this and you don't need to pay some schmuck to do your footwork. We got there at 1:45 and left less than an hour later, went to Joy Yee's in Chinatown, ate and STILL beat the rush hour back to the "Region." Thank You Big Brother (at least this time!)
