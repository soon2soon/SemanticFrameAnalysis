With the central location and the fresh renewed rooms that's one of the best hostels I've ever been. The getaway offers tonnes of activities so even when you don't know what to do, you'll never be bored. For people who likes to go shopping it's dangerous because within 5 min or even less is a big shopping street. So be carefull. For people who likes to party or simply hang out in a bar they are at the right place. Several bars are reachable in only a few minutes by foot.
