AAA uses disreputable tow companies and repair facilities.  My daughter had a break down and called AAA.  The tow driver told her that there was only one shop he could take the car to, Northlake Auto Repair.  We had to hire a tow truck to get the car to our repair shop and were charged $50 to get our car released.  Total extortion.  When I complained to AAA they said to call the BBB to complain.  AAA was no help in this matter at all.   BEWARE OF AAA.
