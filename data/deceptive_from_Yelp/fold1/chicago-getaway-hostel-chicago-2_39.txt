I stayed at this hostel in mid-March...I was VERY comfortable and HIGHLY impressed by the hostel. i met some cool people and had a great experience. My only complaints are: NO IRONING BOARD and an old iron. I feel that they should have at least two boards and two GOOD irons for those of us on business and in need of ironing a white shirt. I also do not understand why there are no free public phones to call locally. it was REALLY annoying to get change for a payphone. otherwise, the experience was AMAZING!
