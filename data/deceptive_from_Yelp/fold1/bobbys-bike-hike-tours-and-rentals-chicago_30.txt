I created an account just so I could write a review for Bobby's Bike Hike, that's how awesome it was. I just visited Chicago for the first time this past weekend and on my first day, I took the evening bike tour led by Ryan. Honestly, it was the highlight of my trip! I highly recommend taking it at night, the city is absolutely gorgeous! I was able to cover more ground and see parts of the city that I otherwise wouldn't have spent time visiting, like the Bears stadium, the Natural History Museum, and the first house Frank Lloyd Wright built.   Ryan also was a great tour guide!  He had great enthusiasm, led us safely through the city (a boy about 10-12 yrs old was also in our group), and was able to answer any random questions along the way. The ride is predominately flat and at a good pace, and the bikes have multiple gears, so I feel most fitness levels can take part.  Also, I was visiting the city alone, so I recommend this for anyone traveling alone and looking for something to do with other people.
