I had a blast on this tour! I love Chicago, and visit frequently, but I always like learning something new. This tour was an extremely pleasant two hours, and focussed on some of the lesser known facts about downtown Chicago. Rather than a list of information I could get from a simple brochure or a quick Google search, Amanda (the owner) really took the time to find information that is 'off the beaten track'. She was very knowledgeable and made the tour interesting and informative. I took this tour four days ago and I've already recommended it to many of my friends - it's a must-do when visiting or living in Chicago!
