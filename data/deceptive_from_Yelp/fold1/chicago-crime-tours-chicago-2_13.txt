Our tour was a private tour for myself and my eight year old son. Our tour guide, Mark, picked us up at our hotel right on time. Mark was wonderful. A father himself, Mark kept my son actively engaged and active in our conversations. I could not speak more highly of Mark as a guide, or as a person for that matter, he was very easy to be around. The vehicle we were picked-up in and transported around in was very clean and comfortable. It was easy to get in and out of and I felt safe and secure both with the car and the driver. There were no "white knuckle" moments, even in a city known for it's traffic. Being from Los Angeles, I can honestly say that I prefer LA traffic to Chicago's. I'm very glad that Mark handled the hassle of driving for me, allowing me to gawk and awe at the sites of the Windy City. We played a number of our tour sites by ear. Sure, there were the usual tour sites, like where Dillinger got shot in the back by the cops; the St Valentines Day Massacre and other notable sites. I was also glad that Mark included stops at Wrigley Field and The Willis Tower for us. I sincerely appreciate the flexibility, it made the tour feel much more personalized. The private tour also allowed us to make stops and get out and walk around at some of the busier sites. I highly recommend this tour company, and especially their private tour service. This tour was worth every penny and more!!!
