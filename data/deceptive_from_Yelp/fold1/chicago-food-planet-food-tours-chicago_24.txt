I enjoyed Kent's tour of the Gold Coast so much, that at the end of it, I signed up via my phone for another one the next day for Bucktown/Wicker Park. It's not only a great way taste more foodie treats than you would be able to enjoy on a normal day with out needing a wheelbarrow for your belly, but a pleasant and informative way to get to know areas you might not venture out to on a city vacation. He had a wry sense of humor, lots of local stories and background information, and knew the food, the owners of the establishments, and what made them highly regarded. I would recommend the tours to anyone visiting Chicago that wants to go a step further than the usual touristy haunts.
