I live in Chicago but had heard about the Lake Shore tour from several people who said it was incredible. Even as a local, I loved the tour and saw / learned things about Chicago that I had never seen before. I only wish I had done the tour sooner. David S. was our guide. He was very knowledgeable and make the tour enjoyable, informative and fun. It would definitely recommend asking for him.
