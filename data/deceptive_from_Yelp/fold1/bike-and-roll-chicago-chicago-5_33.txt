A few weeks ago Me and my mom did the segway tour! It was amazing! We had never done segways before and they are as fun as they look! We also had a very friendly and funny guide Michael, who surely knew his facts and was really fun. I learned a lot of Chicago history as well. Anyone who is looking for a segway tour should choose Bike and Roll, it is one of the Â most fun things I have ever done and I had such a great time!
