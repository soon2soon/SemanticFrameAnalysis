In winter Chicago is "cool" - literally - so stay warm in the Pedway as you explore the underground pathways of the city. Being both an author and comedian Margaret has a great way of delivering interesting facts with flavor and humor. Your cheekbones will hurt from smiling as you watch Margaret give the city a big hug through her words and actions. I highly recommend Chicago Elevated tours!
