Mostly hated this trip - went April 2011.  Caravan separated us from the other couple we were traveling with, put us on different buses & different hotels and WOULD NOT cooperate to change with other travelers who volunteered to change.  We got to spend 1 day with them at the same hotel at the end of the trip.  We had 42 on our uncomfortable bus and 38 got food poisoning and our group leader could care less!!  We were sick for 3 days.  Our guide was only concerned about making his scheduled bus time so a lot of our time felt rushed.  I realize you have to keep a schedule, but really...do we really need to run thru the forest to keep our schedule. Once we got home & contacted our travel agent, he couldn't believe they separated his whole group (which would have filled 1 bus) let alone travelers with the same last name!!!  We had to fight to get them to reimburse us and we got a whole $100 each back.  Thanks for ruining our vacation Caravan!!!!!!!!!!
