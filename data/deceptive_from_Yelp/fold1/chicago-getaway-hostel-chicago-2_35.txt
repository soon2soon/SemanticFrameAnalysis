Getaway hostel is a pretty good hostel! Let's start with location. Located in a really safe quite neighborhood just 13 minutes walk to fullerton train station ( Red line) . There is also a good supermarket not far from the train station. The hostel itself is clean and front desk staff are helpful and nice . If you're booking a room here , and traveling alone, try to avoid the room at the basement . It gives claustrophobic feeling even though you'll enjoy ensuite bathroom but I think it doesn't worth it. Breakfast is respectful including: bagels, jam, bread etc. they don't bring orange juice. Which is annoying! Common area are great! You can use the computers for free and the t.v room is pretty nice as well. I reccomend!
