I purchased a 2-hour BYOB cruise with them through youswoop and we had a fantastic time! It was a group of 9 of us, and we were able to cruise around Goose Island and head down the south portion of the Chicago River. We brought our own booze and food, and you can purchase ice and they provide you with a cooler. The staff was very relaxed, and the boat is incredibly easy to drive, perfect for a lazy ride on the Chicago River. I would absolutely rent from them again!
