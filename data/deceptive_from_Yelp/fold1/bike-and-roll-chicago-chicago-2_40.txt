Had purchased Groupons for 6 for Segway Sunset Tour.  Made quite a few calls to the office with questions and then trying to book a date then to cancel and rebook and the people could not have been nicer and more accommodating.  Ended up going on a cloudy Sunday night Memorial Weekend and we (2 adults and 4 kids 12+) had Crystal (tour guide) to ourselves.  She was amazing, fun and very patient with our mixed age, skills group.   Thought the tour might be too touristy for us since we live in Chicago and bike downtown often but we were amazed she took us to places we haven't been.  Was quite a memorable evening and the kids keep asking when we can go again.  Highly recommended and the Groupon is a great deal.
