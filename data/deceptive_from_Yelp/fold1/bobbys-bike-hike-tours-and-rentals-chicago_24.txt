Bobby's Bike Hike was excellent & highly recommended! We had a great time & saw new things even though we are lifetime Chicagoans who go downtown a lot. The bike riding was well-paced.  Our guide Jonathan made the bike tour! He was funny and nice and knowledgeable, and really made our evening! He gave us a full three-hour tour, and arrived at Buckingham fountain at just the right time when the fountain was lit and appropriately dark, and just in time at a good spot to see the fireworks on Wednesday night. The Schwinn bikes were well-maintained and sturdy.  To be honest, in reading the other reviews, the bike helmets could have been better, but they were not too bad.  But the bikes were excellent. We were able to rest at scenic photo spots along the way, and all in our group were not tired even though the tour was three hours.  Our tour had a wide variety of nice folks ages approximately 15 to 65. We would highly recommend.  One couple in our group has gone on all of Bobby's Bike Hike tours and thought this was their best experience with the Chicago Lights at Night tour and Jonathan was the best tour guide they have had.
