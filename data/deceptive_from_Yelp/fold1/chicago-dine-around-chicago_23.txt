Chicago Dine-Around was one of the best tours I have ever taken!  I decided to do this for my birthday after it was recommended by someone who had previously taken it and I did this with a few friends and it was the most fun I had ever had!  The food was great, couldn't ask for anything better, and the ambiance was also fantastic, and people who took the same tour as my friends and I all came together and turned out to be one big party (even after the tour)!  This truly was a great way to experience Chicago dining at it's finest, and I would recommend this to ANYONE who is both from out of town and from Chicago.  It was so much fun, and I would do it again!"
