Rented for 3 day weekend Alamo-ORD, Dec. 5-8.  Online advance check-in went smoothly.  Presented papers to shuttle driver who drove us directly to car class area (mid-size), chose car and drove to check-out booth.  We did not have to wait in any lines. This saved significant time.  Car return also went smoothly.
