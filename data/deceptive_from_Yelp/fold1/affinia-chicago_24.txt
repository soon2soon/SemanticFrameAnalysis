I usually stay at the Wyndham when I'm in Chicago, but due to my repeated inability to control the A/C in their rooms, decided to try the Affinia. I have a new fave - at the same price! The bed was comfy and the overall room was nice and much more user-friendly than many (full-length mirror, well-lit bathroom, plenty of hangers in closet, etc). Love the roof deck for evening drinks. My only gripe was in getting a shower cap. First I asked at the front desk; he kindly said he'd have one sent right up. Didn't come. So an hour later I called guest services. They said they'd send one up. Never came. Finally, THE NEXT MORNING, I called again. This time it came, about 15 minutes later. Not sure what the issue was there. Otherwise the staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful. Overall, a stellar hotel.
