This tour was amaze-balls. I went with three of my friends, and we all had a fantastic time. The "tour guide," Jonathon, really knew his stuff without getting boring. The tour was interactive and not cheesy by any means. The information was incredibly interesting and the locations we visited were super welcoming. The people at each location were helpful and informative. They all treated us like we were part of their family. We weren't sure which drinks to order at each place, but the tour came fully prepared with suggestions and a list of historically prominent people. We drank, we learned, and we had a blast. I can't stress enough how much fun we had.
