OK, this place doesn't look like much from the outside.  But it's the proverbial "don't judge a book by its cover."  This place is much nicer than places for which I've paid twice as much. Best of all, the staff is awesome.  Friendly and very helpful... including the hotel's official dog, Buddy! My room was remodeled and included a small fridge, microwave, flat screen TV (including a bunch of premium channels), free Wi-Fi and breakfast.  Lots of yummy (not fancy) local restaurants... as well as a few chain restaurants are within walking distance.  The Orange Line to downtown is just a few blocks away. Love this place.  Highly recommend.
