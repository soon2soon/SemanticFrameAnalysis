Hi Antoinette: I want to express my thanks to you, Roger Kirby, and the rest of the team at Aries Charter.  It was a pleasure to know the bus arrangements were in such good hands. The bus arrived early (yippee!), and Roger was courteous, helpful, and one of the most pleasant bus drivers I've met in my many, many years of event planning.  Please express my personal thanks to him, and let the powers that be know what a great job he does. Thanks also to your team for meeting with the audio guys who made a site visit to make sure their cabling was compatible with the bus.   And you, of course, were helpful and very pleasant to work with.  It had been a long time since I've used Aries, but will make sure that when my future needs require a bus, you'll be on my speed dial! Thanks again!
