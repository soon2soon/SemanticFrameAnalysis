I spent 3 weeks trying to reach someone at this company either via email or telephone, and actually reached an employee at one time, but he could not help me and said I would get a call back the next day.  A week and a half later I still had not heard back and emailed again.  I finally got a phone call from the rudest person I have ever spoken with who refused to make my reservation or to help me at all and ended up putting another employee on the phone who told me to "take your business to someone else".  I definitely will do just that, and I would recommend that you do the same, unless you enjoy being spoken to as if you are the world's biggest idiot.
