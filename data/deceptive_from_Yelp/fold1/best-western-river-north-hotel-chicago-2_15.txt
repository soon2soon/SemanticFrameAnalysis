Where to begin.... Pros: - location - good tasting tap water - 24 hour mcdonald's across from the hotel Cons: - the smell in the hallways (is it mold? is it disinfectant covering up the scent of mold? I cannot tell. It was not pleasant) - no ice machine on my floor (under a sheet out of service) and sold out drink vending machine all 5 days I was here - no fridge or microwave in the rooms - internet went down multiple times (for hours each time) - not enough parking underground, very small spaces too (okay for those douchey smart cars I guess.) - very loud heater, you can control room temperature but it is always either too hot or too cold - shower temperature sketchy at times - constant room service cleaning during the day (loud vacuuming all day) - very small king size rooms, could barely close the bathroom door, the toilet is an inch away) - the view I had was of the other rooms (a U shaped building) - constant noise of police and ambulances at night (thank god for that loud heater to drown it out) - didn't try the room service because the restaurant attached to the hotel was so sketchy looking and outdated. - a hint of sewage smell in the entrance to the parking lot
