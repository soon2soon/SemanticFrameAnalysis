I have used Chicago Limos Inn for the last 2.5 years for my work.  The customer service reps are always helpful, happy and willing to help in any way.  They are very understanding on last minute changes, especially with executives.   It is easy to book as well as cancel if need be.  Adjusting reservations is just as easy.  Plus, after using them for so long, they now know who I am when I call in and the profile is already up.   Thank you Chicago Limos Inn for making my job so much easier!
