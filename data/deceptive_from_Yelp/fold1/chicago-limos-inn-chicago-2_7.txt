Don't Use the Website! I booked a New Years Eve reservation online.  The confirmation email came back with a price of $102 instead of the $66 quoted on the website.  I had to call, leave a message, and get a call back (which was only about 5 minutes) in order to cancel.  When El called me back, he said "We'll cancel that reservation; we don't have any cars" -- even though they had just confirmed my reservation!  They cancelled quickly -- which was really the only good thing about the experience.
