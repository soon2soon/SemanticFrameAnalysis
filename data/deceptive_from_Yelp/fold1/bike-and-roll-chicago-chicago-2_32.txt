Took the 6pm Skyscraper Segway Tour with my daughters who were begging to try out a Segway. I wasn't that thrilled about driving 35 miles, paying $20 to park and rolling around Chicago in the dark. Didn't think I would see much. But I was wrong! It was truly a surprise of a good time! Â I would highly recommend this tour to anyone. Our tour guide Anthony was a hoot and very knowledgeable and put everyone at ease. We did see a lot (all the way down to Soldier Field) and actually went along at a good clip, not slow like I thought "beginners" would be. Makes me want to buy one of these expensive modes of transportation though!!
