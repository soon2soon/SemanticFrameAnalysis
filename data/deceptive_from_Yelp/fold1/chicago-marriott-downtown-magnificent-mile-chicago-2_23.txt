The staff was great. The women at the front desk gave us warm cookies...The rooms was very clean and what a view! I was shocked that we even got to have such a view. It was gorgeous. The restaurant connected to the hotel was very clean and the food was great. I will be visiting the Double Tree Hilton again.
