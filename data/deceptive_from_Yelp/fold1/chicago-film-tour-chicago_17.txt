What a great tour!  I ended up taking one of the tour that specializes in only the Blues Brothers.  The video clips they showed on the tv monitors were perfectly timed so that you could see what was going on in the movie and look up and see the location/building. The guide for very enthusiastic and had lots of knowledge about the movie and the city.  The bus was comfortable, had a bathroom, and wasn't hot (we went on a 90 degree day).  They also let you bring whatever drinks/food you would like on the bus.  Including adult drinks!
