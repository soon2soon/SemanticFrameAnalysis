This hotel is listed as a location for parking on Park Ride Fly USA for O'Hare. Do not park here! It is very difficult to get to the hotel itself and there is no signage at all that tells customers where exactly to park. Beyond that, you have to go to the third floor of the hotel to the check in desk to register for parking (even if you have prepaid). The shuttle leaves every 20 minutes, and not a minute before. The driver will take an extra two minutes explaining the ride and will then inform you there are additional stops on the way to the airport, all elements that add significant time to your trip. When you return, there is a loooong walk back to the shuttle pick up area, where they come and go in 20 minute intervals. Overall, I would not recommend this parking lot. At all. Pay the one to two dollars extra and park at the airport.
