My girlfriend and I are both from Pittsburgh and spent a long weekend in Chicago in June. We tried to book a tour with Brews Cruise through Groupon, but they were sold out, so we booked through the Brews Cruise website. Our tour was on a Friday from around 12:30-4:30 and consisted of visiting three breweries: Goose Island (which isn't normally open to the public), Revolution Brewing, and Lake Effect Brewing. We spent about 45mins to an hour at each facility, where we learned about their beers, spoke with brewmasters, and were allowed to sample three or four beers each. Rick, the owner and tour guide, was very personable and knowledgeable. He made sure no one got lost, and provided water and snacks on the bus. He knows a lot about beer and the Chicago beer scene and was able to provide a lot of background information for us since we weren't from Chicago. All-in-all, it was a fantastic tour and I would go again if given the chance. I would recommend it to anyone who is into craft beer, or just looking for a fun way to spend the day!
