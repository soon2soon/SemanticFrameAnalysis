WOW!!!! Â  We had soooooo much fun!!! the guides are very insightful, and know their equipment well! we have a lot of great pictures, and had great communication with "the others" we were well prepared for what we were going to experience, with lots of communication with the owner, and made himself available to us, in case we had any issues finding the tour sight.. We are already planning another tour, with a larger group of friends.. Thanks Brian!!
