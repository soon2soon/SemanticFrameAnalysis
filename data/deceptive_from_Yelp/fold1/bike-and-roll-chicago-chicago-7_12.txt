Here is the 411 and take it for what it's worth.  I took a tour with Bobby's Bike Hike last week and found that they actually rent bikes for $20/day.  They are located a block west of Navy Pier so its very accessible.   I thought you guys should know so you don't pay too much when you bike around the lakefront.  Oh, and there night tour was a ton of fun.
