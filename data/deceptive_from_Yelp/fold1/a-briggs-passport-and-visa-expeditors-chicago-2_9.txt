I've used them for a couple of years now and so far knock on wood always been helpful and very efficient in getting our Visas on time.  John at Briggs in Chicago and team has been extremely helpful and always notifies me what to expect before sending out our requests to them.  He always communicates with me on the status of our requests and it's been great to have everything we need very quickly.  Thank you John!
