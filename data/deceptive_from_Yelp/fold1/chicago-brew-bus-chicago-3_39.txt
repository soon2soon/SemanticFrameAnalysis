A large group of my friends ranging from 32-41 years old went on the brew bus last night.   Jonathan was our driver.  Nick was our guide.  We started at Goose Island, then went to Haymarket, Moonshine and back to Goose Island.  The bus ride was a lot of fun and we met some fun people on the tour.  A good time was had by all.  Because the tour ended at 7, we continued the good time at Goose Island.  Everyone wants to do tour again.
