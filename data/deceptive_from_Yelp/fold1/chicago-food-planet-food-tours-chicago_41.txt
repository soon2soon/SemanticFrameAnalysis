Just finished up the near north food tour and promised our tour guide chris that i'd give him high praise for an amazing afternoon. The tour was a perfect blend of humor, history, fun facts, and of course, food. Â The tasting spots were a mindful selection of places where i wouldn't necessarily set foot in, and we were always greeted with smiling faces and knowledgeable staff. bravo! and can't wait to check out the china town tour!
