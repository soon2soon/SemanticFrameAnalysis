Did my first ever Segway tour (hard to believe, as I live in the city) with my mom and brother here this summer. We loved it! I work in the loop, and see many different companies zooming past me on a daily basis. From what I've heard from locals, segway experts, and past/current segway employees, Bike and Roll is the BEST. We loved every minute of it, felt we got the best for our money, and felt safe and sound the entire time! Justin was our tour-guide and he did an absolutely phenomenal job. He was friendly, fun, knowledgeable, thorough, excited, and put those of us who nervous at ease! His training was great--he took time with each of us individually to make sure we became segway masters. He was then really great about the pacing and making sure that these other 3 guys we were with (who kept trying to be speed demons) knew to keep it calm (in a friendly, and polite way). He told great stories about this beautiful city and I can verify that everything he said was TRUE! I've heard some whacky stories told by unofficial tour guides in the city, but Justin told some amazingly true stories. All in all, an excellent segway tour. Thanks so much for the experience!
