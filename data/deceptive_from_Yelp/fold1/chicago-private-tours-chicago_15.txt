I had the best tour experience today! I was between a mini-tour and a full tour, and I opted for the full tour so we could get into the neighborhoods. The guide was informative and fun, the vehicle was awesome (glass top roof) and for a private, customized tour, I couldn't have asked for more! They even made restaurant recomendations and dropped me off there with no fuss.
