I went with my teenage son, who is into paranormal activity.  We had a WONDERFUL time and really enjoyed ourselves.  The team was great and they showed us all the equipment and we were able to hunt for ghosts in the massive basement of the building.  I was initially concerned with the length of the tour, but it flew by.  We both thought it would be fun to go back again. I would actually like a longer tour or one that started a little later, as they say activity increases later at night. We had a lot of activity and it was very interesting to see how the equipment worked for different people.  It is a spooky location, but not frightening.  I had many strong feelings(not negative or sad- just impressions), while I was there and I felt comfortable discussing those with my group- and they were all strangers.  My son did really well with the rods and we had a "bring your own ghost experience" although, it was not related to us.   I would love to go to the tours in Galena, as it could be paired with many other fun things to do in that area.  I wish them success in their business and know you many people will enjoy this tour.
