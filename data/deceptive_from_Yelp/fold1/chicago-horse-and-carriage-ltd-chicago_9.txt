For the last two weeks I've been trying to book a carriage ride with this company. The online booking to elect the 30 minute ride they offer does not work. So I called the number supplied on their web site. My first try, I left a message on their voice mail. After no response, I tried again two days later. This time the voice mail message indicated that the messages were full. I continued to try daily on both the online site and the telephone number provided to no avail. I just wasted a lot of time for nothing after two weeks. DON'T WASTE YOURS.
