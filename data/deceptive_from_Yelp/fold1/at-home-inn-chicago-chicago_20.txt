After looking for 2 hotel rooms in Chicago for our Lollapalooza trip, I was shocked, we were going to have to pay over $600 per night total for both rooms over a 5 night period. I stumbled across At Home Inn Chicago and I'm so glad that I did. Not being familiar with Chicago, our wonderful rep found us a beautiful 2 bdrm apartment on the 12th floor of a one year old high rise just 12 blocks from Grant Park. We could not have been more pleased with the help, attention and the $350 per night rate. We received confirmation emails that kept us up to date.The owner met us upon our arrival to give is the keys and gave us the tour and everything that we needed, including coffee. It was a real pleasure to deal with her, she could not have been nicer and accomadating. I highly recommend At Home Inn Chicago and will definately use their services again.
