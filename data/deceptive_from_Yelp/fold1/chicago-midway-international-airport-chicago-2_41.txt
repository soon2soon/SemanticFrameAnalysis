I haven't flown out of Midway airport in 20 years, but my husband and I flew to Reno and back earlier in the month, and wow has it changed!  It makes Ohare look old, and Southwest is only at Midway.  We saved about $500 by flying Southwest, and we didn't have any of the delays we are used to at Ohare.  What a great experience!
