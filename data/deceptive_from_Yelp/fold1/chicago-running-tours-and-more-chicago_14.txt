What a great way to learn more about the history of the Windy City!  My tour was called, "Chicago Tragic Events" and was a 5km walking tour with the lovely and entertaining, Marlin Kessler.  Besides being very knowledgeable about Chicago's colorful past, Marlin is good-natured, passionate, and cracks all sorts of corny jokes that get you giggling.  I've visited Chicago several times before, but never did I learn so much about this city in such a fun way!  Be sure to bring your camera, a light snack, water, walking shoes, and lots of questions.  Highlights of the tour included visiting Death Alley and exploring the numerous artifacts on the Tribune Tower.  A Chicago City Running (or Walking) tour is the perfect way to combine history with activity.  An A+ Chicago Must-Do!
