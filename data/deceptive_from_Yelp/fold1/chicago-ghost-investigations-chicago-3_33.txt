We had a great time doing our own ghost investigation.  It was so awesome to use the "tools of the trade" to communicate with the other side, and we got amazing responses.  I would do this tour again in a heartbeat and will definitely tell friends about it.  Thanks again, Brian and crew, for a great time!
