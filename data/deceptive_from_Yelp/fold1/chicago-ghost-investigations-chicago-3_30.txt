I recently attended a Ghost Investigation this past Saturday (1/19/13).....and had the most amazing experience.  I want to take the opportunity to thank you for that:) and wanted to tell you about my experience before attending the investigation. I have never ever had a customer service experience like I did with Karen.  She truly went above and beyond in taking time to explain every aspect and answer every question.  This is imperative to anyone but even more so when you are bringing two teens (who are very impressionable) to this type of event.   Additionally, the information she provided me with was extremely helpful in preparing my self and the teen girls I was bringing for the experience.  We had a BYOG experience that will forever be remembered.  My father passed away 3/4/11.....we lived in the same building and needless to say we were very close.  My daughter was his dumplin (he and my mother took care of her when I went back to work after having her) and they had an incredible bond as well.  Needless to say we made contact with him on Saturday and even have an apparition of him in one of the photos. Thanks to Karen my daughter and I were prepared for this....if Karen hadn't gone above and beyond in providing the information she did we may not have had the same experience.   So in conclusion, hold on to Karen with everything you have.....it would be impossible to find a replacement for someone that gives from the heart like she does.   The night of the event was awesome...the guides were incredible and took time to answer every question, help in anyway, and even looked at pics we had questions about. Thank you for your time and for the opportunity to talk to my Daddy one more time:) Everyone should attend one of these Ghost Investigations....it is something you will remember forever!!!
