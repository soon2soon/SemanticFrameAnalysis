We took the Underground Chicago tour yesterday.  Liz was a wonderful guide whom we all enjoyed.  She was very knowledgeable as well as entertaining.  The tour wasn't exactly what we expected, we thought we would be more "underground", but it was still very interesting and took us to places we had never been before.
