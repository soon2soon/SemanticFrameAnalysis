Bad experience. Small room, they try to charge you for everything. Everyone wets themselves over tge free coffee delivery, but it's not that great and most places I've stayed have a coffee maker in-room, also free, that you can use anytime, whereas the free coffee delivery is only before 11. They also charged $50 to my card without telling me, and explained it with, "Oh, we always do that." Not comforting. Bad service, the bar (which serves admittedly Amazing drinks) is too small. No breakfast (just a $10 voucher for 1 breakfast, regardless of how long you stay). Parking is Super expensive, $35 per night.
