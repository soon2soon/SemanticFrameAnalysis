All of the rave reviews about this architecture tour are spot on!  I took this tour with my father and we had the best time!  Our tour guide was SO well informed and entertaining also!  I never knew how much there was to learn about our amazing architecture in this city!  Would recommend to native Chicagoans and newcomers alike!  Great tour for tourists as well!
