I was excited and looking forward to going on the carriage ride downtown a week before Christmas. Made it to the pickup site and had typical questions about the ride and the driver was VERY RUDE and short with us in answering my questions about the ride. Don't dare bother him during the ride. Apparently the driver I had is extremely unhappy with his job and totally ruined the mood of the evening. Obviously this job requires one to be people oriented and oh, I don't know, how about being happy?? He also asked me for a tip up front before the ride even began and said it should be at least $20. I thought we tipped people based on the service that is provided. How disappointing!
