Really?? I made an appointment by calling the toll free number. I had an 8:30 appointment. I got to the Federal Building and waited in the lobby until 8:25 when I finally got thru security. Up to the 18th floor where I stood in another line! We all walked in and stood in another line. Everyone before me did NOT have an appointment and were processed before me. So what is the use of calling to arrange an appointment? I was also the ONLY one to have ALL of my paperwork in order. Not too hard to follow instructions. Since I'm not traveling until next week, I get my passport in another 2 days. I was hoping I could pick it up later today, no luck. Oh, whatever you do, do NOT ask the security in the building or on the floor a question. They look at you as though they do NOT want to be bothered. I get it, it is a Federal building but lighten up Francis!
