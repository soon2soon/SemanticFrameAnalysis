In July 2013, our company entertained a group of executives aboard the Valara VI yacht. We had a great experience. The Valara VI yacht provided great opportunities for networking with comfy seating inside the lower level for those that wanted to sit back and relax. It also had a great deck with a bar on it where a lot of our guests gathered and mingled. The booking process with Mary was very easy and efficient.  I initially looked on their website to get a feel for the size and quality of the yacht and also the different food & beverage packages that they offered.  I then called and talked to Mary to get comfortable with their operation and immediately booked with Adventure Sea Tours.   The crew working aboard Valara VI was amazing! They were always checking on my guests to see if they needed anything and provided great service in an efficient, attentive manner. I never knew food on boats could be this good! I ordered the Grande Gala package and was amazed by how tasty and delicious the food was. The potatoes were creamy, the meat was tender and moist, and the cheesecake was outstanding.   Many of our guests went back for seconds, it was that good! Our night aboard the Valara VI yacht with Adventure Sea Tours was incredible and they made me look good for selecting them. From the service of the crew, to the food, to the yacht itself; this was a wonderful night and worked perfectly for our networking event.  Big thanks to the crew on board that night and especially to Mary who made the whole booking process easy. Thanks so much!
