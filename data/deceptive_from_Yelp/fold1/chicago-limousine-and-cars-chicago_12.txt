Chicago Limousine & Cars did an outstanding job for me! The limo was nice and clean and arrived on time. The driver was courteous and helpful. We needed to make an unexpected stop and he said it was no problem. He drove us over and waited until we were done. From there we went to our destination. Smooth ride no complaints. I used them before and will in the future. Thank you!
