I live in the city; my husband and I and our two kids just needed to stay one more night at a Marriott to get extras points for next year. We've stayed at plenty of Marriotts around the world so I know what to expect. The service at this particular Maririott exceeded my expectations. Front desk check in was a breeze even at 3:30pm on a holiday weekend. The health club staff went out of their way to find pool toys/goggles for my kids because I left mine at home. This made my kids happy, which made the parents happy! Would stay here again.
