I decided to spend New Year's eve in Chicago and chose to stay in the River Hotel. It was the cheapest hotel I could find in the Loop. I was surprised about the price because of the location. I found the location perfect because it's a short walk from the State/Lake el, so I could get pretty much anywhere I'd want to be. However, all the good stuff in Streeterville is right across the river, so those who want to shop will be happy.I was pleasantly surprised with the suite. It had a nice mini fridge, stainless steel microwave, utensils and plates/bowls. Flat panel TV and free wireless internet was nice. I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in the room, but both came in handy since my friends showed up a little late. The staff was very nice and helpful. Checking in and out was a breeze and they seemed eager to help.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the River Hotel. I felt like it was a major bargain given the location and quality of the room. I would recommend the area if you plan on exploring neighborhoods outside of the Magnificent Mile area. Even if you just want to go to the north side, ride the brown line instead of the red. Elevated trains are much more fun than the subway:)
