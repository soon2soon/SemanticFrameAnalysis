Wow - what a great ECO-FRIENDLY way to see Chicago. It's a whole different perspective !! We had 10 of us on board, during a heat wave, and this was a great way to cool off. The boat has a lovely canopy, and we brought sandwiches and beers with us !! If you are into photography, you can get some GREAT pics of Chicago !! Whether you're a visitor or live in Chicago and have visitors coming in - this is a terrific attraction. Would definately go again, the next time we're in town. THANKS !!!
