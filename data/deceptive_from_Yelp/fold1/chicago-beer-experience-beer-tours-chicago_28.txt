Took the Beer Tour last weekend with a group of friends and had a blast!  Our tour guide Jen was really knowledgeable about beer and Chicago history and we had so much fun tasting the different beers and traveling to each bar.  Definitely loved the bacon pairings at Paddy Longs!  Highly recommend!  Ask for Jen, she's great.
