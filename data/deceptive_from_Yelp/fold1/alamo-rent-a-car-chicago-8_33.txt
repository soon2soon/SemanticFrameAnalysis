Wow. Blown away by Alamo at Chicago O'hare. What a team. They actually helped me with my bags from the van - and then they helped me with my bags to my car. NO OTHER company has ever done that. As I was leaving I asked - are all of the Alamo locations as good as this? 5 stars all the way around. Friendliest and most helpful by far out of all the companies I've used - and I've used them all.
