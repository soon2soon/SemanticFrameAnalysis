Stayed here for 5 days this summer.  Perfect location, we had a spacious room.  The staff were friendly, smiled (sometimes rare in city hotels!) and helpful.  We had an issue with our shower not draining well and they fixed it immediately while we were out, and even left us several gift cards for Starbucks in the lobby. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends.
