I had the distinct pleasure of doing a running tour with Marlin! As many of the other reviewers have said, he is super fun to run with and I had a fabulous time. It was my first time in Chicago and it was a great way to get to know more about the city, the architecture and its history. I was definitely worried before I signed up that my pace might be a little slow - but it was great, Marlin ran at my pace and the time totally flew by. (You also get a sweet goodie bag and t-shirt at the end!) I'm especially excited about all the pictures he took of me running by Chicago landmarks! I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in getting to know Chicago - I can't wait to come back and do another tour!
