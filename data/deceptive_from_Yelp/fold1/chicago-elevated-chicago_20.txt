Being a lifelong resident of the Chicago area with no knowledge of the Chicago Pedway, Margaret's tour more than educated me, it also delighted me. Margaret blends her knowledge of Chicago history with her love (and skill) for performing into a passionate, highly engaging and informative walking tour. This is how historic tours should be done! Not only did I learn about and walk along the Pedway, Margaret also enhanced the experience by incorporating lots of ancillary bits of Chicago's history into the tour (including the Great Chicago Fire, the City of Chicago flag, Chicago skyscrapers and buildings, Marshall Field, and even the Tiffany family). If you're looking for a dry, talking-head, Sgt. Friday "just the facts, ma'am" sort of historic tour, then look elsewhere. What you'll receive from Margaret is a delightful and fun experience that doesn't skimp on the facts. The value I received far exceeded the nominal fee: Margaret clearly delivered everything I anticipated, plus much more. Highly, highly recommended.
