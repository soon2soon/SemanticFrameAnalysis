We had a great time on the lakefront neighborhoods tour. We stopped at several good "photo" stops and interesting places in the neighborhoods. I'm from the south suburbs and I got to see parts of the city I have never seen or even known about. Our tour guide was Hank, and he was fun, knowledgeable and helpful. We HIGHLY recommend this tour!
