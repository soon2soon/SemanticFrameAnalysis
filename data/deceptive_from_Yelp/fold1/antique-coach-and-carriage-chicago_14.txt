I wish there was a way to give less than one star!! i was verbally harassed today by a driver named don ... at least that is what his card said. i was riding with a girlfriend and our chidren... and he was continually saying some of the most inappropriate things to me and other people around us... at one point he said he wished i wasnt married so he would have a chance with me. Â i had something that fell on my shoulder towards my chest area and my friend removed it and he said "i wish i could have done that" ... he kept telling im beautiful in front of others and my children... i mean pay someone a compliment once with respect and than drop it... it was a nightmare and my friend ended up in an arguement with him by the time the ride was over... he didnt give us one shred of history or factual info about the city ... all he did was create a terrible experience for all of us... i certainly hope this has an affect on him and the company he represents as he was simply and awful person!!
