Garbage.  This place is a joke and a scam.  We booked a room and they charged our credit card for it.  We drove all the way to Chicago for our stay.  We tried to get ahold of the people in charge to get access to our room (key(s), etc.) to NO avail.  We are currently stuck in Chicago with no place to stay, thanks to this horrible business.  Do NOT use them.  They have an emergency phone number for guests that goes right to voice mail.  Great emergency line!  What would you expect though from a SCAM of a company!
