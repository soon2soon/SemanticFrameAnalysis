I had a great time on the Brew bus!  I was on one of the first tours, and had my cousin and his friend in town from LA so I took them.  They loved it too.  The beers were great, and the "tour" was fun, but it was more of a party on wheels!  Everyone was singing on the bus and we all bought beer to drink between the breweries.  It was a total blast.   Our tour went to Goose Island, Moonshine, and Revolution.  It was a nice way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and a great way for my friends to see the city.
