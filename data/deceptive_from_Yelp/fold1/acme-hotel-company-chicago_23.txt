If you are renting a car this hotel is not for you.  The garage is behind and disconnected from the hotel.  No valet, no bell hop, and no place to unload so you have to shlep your bags out of the garage and down the street.  I had dress clothes on a hanger when I asked the front desk for a laundry bag they gave me a trash bag.  My room overlooked an alleyway with a brick wall 10ft way and I was next to some type of utility room cranking out intermittent noise throughout the day.  Oh and the gym is smaller than one of their rooms. - not a fan of Acme
