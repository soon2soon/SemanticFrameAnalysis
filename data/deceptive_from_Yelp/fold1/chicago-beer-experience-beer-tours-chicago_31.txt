Had a great time on the beer tour.  Ryan was extremely knowledgeable, witty, and engaging.  He kept everyone involved and had insightful facts about the surrounding neighborhood and bars that we were in.  Overall, a tremendous time that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting or from the Chicago area.
