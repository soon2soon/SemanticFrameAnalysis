A really great (and free!) service, highly recommended. We had many tours already planned, so when choosing, we went with the bike tour. The bikes were provided free, as was our great and knowledgeable tour guide, Wally. We rode near Grant Park (mostly closed for the upcoming Lollapalooza Fest), the museum arear, and all the way up the coast and beaches to Lincoln Park and Zoo. We even had a chance to go through the Gold Coast neighborhood. All the while we got great information and commentary in a 1-1 fashion, which is unbeatable! My guess is that as the word gets out, there will be a logjam of bookings.
