My wife and I just returned from an outstanding 9 day trip with Caravan in Nova Scotia, PEI, and New Brunswick, Canada.Everything was top notch. We were a little apprehensive about traveling with Caravan because their prices are so much lower than all of the other companies we have used in the past. The hotels, meals, guides, drivers, etc. were all wonderful. This will not be our last trip with Caravan. We just wish we had heard about them sooner as we've already been to many of the places they travel to!
