Worst company to deal with!  Don't bother with this place. I arranged for a carriage ride for my fiancee and I as a romantic end to a recent visit to Chicago.  The ride was for Millennium Park and was scheduled for 7:45.  We were advised several times by a representative of the company that if we are late, we will be charged an additional $20 on top of the $160 I had already paid.  We rushed dinner and arrived 20 minutes early.  We approached one driver who told us the one that was scheduled to take us out was not around.  Another driver offered to find out what was going on.  Turns out that our scheduled driver was off that night and the company never let us know.  There is no one from the company there to meet you, the drivers just sit around and don't know what is going on. A driver eventually showed up (15 minutes late) and said she would take us out.  The ride itself was fine, although as another person mentioned, they don't tell you anything about the city. I let Stacey know about our experience, expecting at the very least an apology for us being delayed (after all, had we been late, they would have charged us!).  Instead, the response I got was that, in the view of the company we got "what we paid for and then some" because the driver took a picture of us by the carriage.  On top of everything, she accused my fiancee and I of smoking in the carriage, when neither of us smoke.  I asked for the name of a supervisor and she has yet to provide it. Don't waste your time with this.  It's not as great as it originally sounded.  I would suggest one of the double decker tours, they seemed to know how to treat their customers right.
