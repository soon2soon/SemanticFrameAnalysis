AJ and Corey did an amazing job leading our segway tour.  It was a misty, moisty morning when we all took off.  AJ was a very good teacher to a novice on a segway, giving good directions with patience and kindness.  Corey did a great job making sure we safely crossed busy streets and that  no one was left behind.  AJ regaled us with interesting, little- known facts about the city.  Plus, he is a magician!  Highlights of the tour were segwaying around Buckingham Fountain (we didn't have to stay in our single line formation) and zooming around Soldier Field at the high speed of 8.5mph.  We had the unique opportunity of touring the city enveloped in fog and that made for other worldy pictures to remember our fantastic segway tour.  Would do a tour with AJ and Corey again in a heartbeat!
