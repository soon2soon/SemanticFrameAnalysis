Definitely recommend this! I've lived in the Chicago area for a couple years and have taken several tours during this time. I still learned things that I didn't know. I had Chris as a guide. He was very patient, knowledgeable, interesting and funny. He made sure everyone felt comfortable with the Segways before we started as well as checking on us during the tour. There were 10 people in my group and we were all cracking up and having a great time. If you are in the area, have the money and time, and love history look into this tour!
