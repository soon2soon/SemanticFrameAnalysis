I urgently needed an apartment in Chicago. One friend told me about At Home Inn Chicago and I followed his advice. The apartment was very cozy. The rooms were very nice furnished, very clean and so comfortable, although I have a sleeping problem when I change beds I noticed that I was able to sleep like baby even in the 1st night when the problem really kicks in. When my friends in Chicago came to visit their first words were "WOW nice apartment girl are you sure you can afford it?" but the great part was that it was not expensive at all. I strongly recommend At Home Inn Chicago if you want to stay in a decent place when you visit Chicago.
