I had a nice experience here! There was no air conditioning in my room, and the window refused to stay up high. So that made sleeping hard due to the ridiculous July heat in Chicago. But I know they're working on air conditioning, so it wasn't that big of a deal. The women's bathroom on the second floor was kind of gross. Every time I went in there, there were at least a couple of toilets clogged. It just didn't look incredibly clean. I also had a rude/cold employee check me in. Made me not want to interact with the front desk staff at all after that. I know that sounds silly but I refused to speak with him again. It was not a warm welcome. But the TV room was nice, very friendly fellow hostel goers and its located in a nice neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. But probably in a dorm.
