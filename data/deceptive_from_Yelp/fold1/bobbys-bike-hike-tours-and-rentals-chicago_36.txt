We went on the Bikes, Bites, and Brews tour today with Alex as our tour guide. It was a great experience, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone! Perfect for visitors and Chicagoans alike...this would be a wonderful tour to take out-of-town guests on to show them some of the highlights of Chicago food and culture!
