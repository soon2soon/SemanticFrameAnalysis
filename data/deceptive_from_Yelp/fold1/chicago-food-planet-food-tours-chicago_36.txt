This tour was absolutely fantastic.  We tried great food, sampled some tea, tasted and learned about spices, drank some samples of olive oils and balsamic vinegars, had chocolate butter toffee and ate some perogis.  We learned about everything we tasted plus we received some great historical information about Chicago as we walked. I highly suggest doing this.  I did it with my fiance and we have lived in the city for 5 years and loved it, doing it with a group of friends would be a blast too.  Not just for tourists because after you take the tour you can frequent the businesses you stopped by.  My fiance and I now go to the olive oil place and the tea place to pick up those when we grocery shop.
