I can't get enough of this place! I was there for two days last week & I loved it! I really did! The room was so nice. The tv was awesome! The glow in the dark lips on the bathroom mirror rocked! I love this place so much! I live in Chicago & I when I need silence and relaxation I come to the Acme! The elevators are small but I can deal with that. Free coffee in the morning! I am telling ALL if you want to relax the Acme Hotel is the place to be. There are stores & restaurants all around! It's a very low key spot & I love it! I plan to be there for a few days in May (my birthday). Please don't change a single thing! Tens all around! Wonderful place!
