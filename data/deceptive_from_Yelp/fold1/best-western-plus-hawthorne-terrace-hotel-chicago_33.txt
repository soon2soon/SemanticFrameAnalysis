What a wonderful place , my husband and I are visiting from California and couldn't stay with friends, so we found this place and are very happy we did, in the beautiful lake view  area, the nice thing is it's by so many different venues, the bars are in walking distance, you have diff  restaurants, hair salons, clothing shops, ect, and close too the lake is a plus:).
