My wife and I rented a furnished apartment for a month while we were in transition between selling our condo and moving into a new place.  The locaton was phenominal and the unit had all that we needed.  My big complaint was that the owners had cats and whenever I was in the apartment I was sneezing.   My sister in law had the same problem.  The furniture had cat hair embedded in it.  I give At Home Inn, 4 stars.  I give the owners one star for not disclosing the fact that a cat lived there and for not cleaning thoroughly.   At Home should add that question to their list when looking for perspective places to rent.
