Took the holiday pedway tour extravaganza with Margaret last week and it was fantastic.  She is fun & knowledgeable.  I also took my teen-aged niece who had a great time as well.  As a bonus I was able to use the comfortably heated pedway instead of the windy 17 degree Chicago Streets for about 3/4 of a mile of my commute this morning!  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Chicago, and especially to anyone who spends time in the Loop.
