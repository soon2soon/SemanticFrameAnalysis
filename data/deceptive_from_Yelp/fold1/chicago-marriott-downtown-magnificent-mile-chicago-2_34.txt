Just came back from a 3 night stay at the magnificent mile in Chicago. Third experience and out of three times, not impressed this time. Lobby, bar, location and staff... All great BUT rooms need serious updating. Was put in room 3306 in a handicapped room (even though I had a reservation for a queen bed I was told only handicapped rooms available). Not caring either way, I accepted. I didn't realize though that the room would be dated with peeling wallpaper, old beaten up furniture, a loud and rickety air conditioning unit and a shower that barely had enough pressure to rinse your hair. Â Hopefully when I go back for another event in Chicago, their rooms will be upgraded cuz they sure need them!
