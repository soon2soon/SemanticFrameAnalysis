My wife and I scheduled this tour for our last day in Chicago.  What a great way to relax and try some new beers.  We were toured around by the owner, Chris.  He provided us with information about the beers we were tasting, and he seemed truly interested in which ones were the most popular.  We went to three different breweries, with each one being about 10 minutes apart by the bus.  The tour had specially set up tables for us at each location, and they were ready with our samples upon arrival.  All included, we tasted about 14 different beers.  If you were ambitious, you had some time to order another one at a couple of the locations.  The final brewery we visited had actually only been open about 3 weeks, and they had arranged for a tour of the brewery.  While we ran out of time and had to skip the tour at the final location, this was a nice add.  From talking with the owners, this company has only been going for about a year, but they are doing a great job and pass along their enjoyment for trying new brews.  This is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon to get you ready for a night out on the town.
