The tour was awesome. If you like craft beer and would like to learn about all the hard work and science that goes into it, this tour is for you. You will drink tons of beer! Mostly sample sizes but a few pints as well. The tour guide was awesome . I recommend this tour ! Now go! Purchase Â your tickets.
