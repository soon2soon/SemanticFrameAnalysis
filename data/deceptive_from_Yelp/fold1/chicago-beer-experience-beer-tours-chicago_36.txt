I did a Chicago Beer Experience Tour this past weekend, and it was amazing!  It far exceeded all of my expectations.  Chris, the wonderful host, was so knowledgeable about different kinds of beers, at-home brewing, and Chicago brewery history.  We sampled 16 different types of beers, from lighter lagers to darker ales at 4 bars in Lincoln Park / Diversey.   The BEST part of the tour is stopping at Paddy Long's to sample 4 different beers with BACON!  The bacon was selected to compliment the beers, and it was a hit!   I would definitely recommend this tour!
