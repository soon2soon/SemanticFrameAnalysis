The rating could perhaps go a little higher as functionally  everything worked (except wi-fi would be lost for some intervals), and it was an ideal location (2525 N Orchard).  Although basically clean, the decor was bad.  A very small investment could improve it greatly.  Externally, there were dead vines growing on the front and side of the house.  Overall, we expected more for the price.
