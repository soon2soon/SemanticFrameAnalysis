I was going to be traveling out of the country on a Wednesday and on Monday when I started packing I realized I had misplaced my passport. I hurried up and made an appointment on that day for Tuesday at 1 p.m. I flew in to Chicago early and showed up to the office at 10:30. I got through almost right away and had a passport in hand at 1:50 p.m. that day! Excellent help, very nice people.
