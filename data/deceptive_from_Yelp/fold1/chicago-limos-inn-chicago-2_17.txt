Thank you Limos Inn for making my daughters Wedding perfect, The lImo was clean , the driver was professional , on time and very thoughtful. He knew every corner in Chicago downtown and we were very pleased with the garden he chose for the pictures. I recommended your company to everyone i know and im sure they will enjoy there experience as much as we did, It was fabulous doing business with you and hopefully we will continue to do so for all future transportation planning.
