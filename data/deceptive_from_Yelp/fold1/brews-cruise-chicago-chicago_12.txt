I purchased a Brews Cruise tour package for my boyfriend, a HUGE craft beer enthusiast, and I as an anniversary gift. I myself am still learning more about local breweries and craft beer, so I was really looking forward to the tour to learn more. We toured Goose Island, Revolution Brewing, and Lake Effect Brewing yesterday afternoon and were able to get a behind the scenes look at each facility and their process for creating their beers. You take a Brews Cruise tour bus which is stocked with coolers of water and snacks for the ride between locations. The tour lasts roughly 3 1/2-4 hours, providing an ample amount of time to be spent at each location. This was definitely an awesome way to spend a Friday afternoon on such a beautiful summer day! All of the brewers at each facility were very friendly and informative about their products and their process for creating them in their operations, and we were provided with numerous samples of their beers at each brewery. Our tour guide, Rick, is nothing short of excellent and is really informative about beers and local breweries as well. He's also very helpful when it comes to purchasing your package! If you're new to the area, visiting from out of town, or just looking for something fun to do around Chicago and love craft beer (or are even still learning about it like me!), I definitely recommend Brews Cruise Chicago! My craft beer expert boyfriend had an amazing time and I had a greater experience than I could have imagined being still new to it all. You're definitely guaranteed a fun-filled, one-of-a-kind experience at such a great price! 5 stars indeed! :)
