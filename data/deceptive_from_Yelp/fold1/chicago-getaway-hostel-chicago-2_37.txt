For what this hostel is advertised as, it is spot on. It's in a cool neighbourhood, it's immaculately clean, the free access to netbooks and bikes in summer months is wonderful. The continental breakfast is pretty standard as far as breakfast goes, but definitely a perk. The staff were pretty nice too. I will say that when I stayed there I felt like I was staying at my first-year residence. This hostel goes for a party feel, which fits with the student-frat house locale of Lincoln Park. I was not travelling alone, so I didn't participate in any hostel events, but I'm sure I would have appreciated them if I were. It feels like it's in a perpetual state of Frosh Week (or Freshman week or whatever Americans call it). I think this is a good thing - there is always something to do if you're unsure where to start, but there is no obligation to participate if you don't want to. All in all, we had a pretty great time here. I'd recommend it. Price is right, it's super clean and in a great spot in Chicago. Would stay again.
