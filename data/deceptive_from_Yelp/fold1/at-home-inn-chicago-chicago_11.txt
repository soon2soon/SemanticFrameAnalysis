I have a really bad experience with At Home Inn Chicago. This is not a review about the cleanness, location, or any unit-related issues. This is about their customer services. So, I've partially paid for a 3 BD/2 BA for the period from 7/20 to 7/27 on 6/2. I got an email on Friday 6/27 saying that the unit will not be available due to some limitation in accessing the unit. They offered another 2 BD/ BA unit with the same price or an "upgraded" 4 BD/ BA unit (1.5 miles away), with a 50$/night rate increase. On the same day, I contacted one of their members and gave her my verbal agreement that I take the second option (4 BD/ 2 BA) and just right before she hangs up the phone she told me she will send me the new contract on Monday. On Tuesday 7/1, I got an email from another member saying that because I didn't respond to the email, the unit has been already booked! They offered me an even further unit with the same price. While in arguing that it's not my mistake that they guaranteed the unit to someone's else, they refused to accept that they has a mistake not booking that unit for me. I felt that I was being accused that I was lying about the call I made on Friday by stating that they also work on Saturdays and it doesn't make sense to wait till Monday!! I've got my full refund back. But I am so frustrated because it seems that they were not willing to rent the unit I paid for.
