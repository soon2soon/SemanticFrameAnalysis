Great overall, but kind of like buying seats to a rock concert only to find it is now general admission! Previous reviews are pretty much spot on.  I have done business with passport agencies in Boston, SF, LA and NYC.  This was by far the most user-friendly and got the passport same-day.   However, do not be fooled by the WebSite and the instructions - particularly the bit about not showing up more than 15 minutes early, and the need for an appointment.  While having an appointment can not hurt, the previous reviews, along with what I saw today, appointments are merely suggestions.  A number of sad stories about needing it that day, and it did not seem to delay them at all. In addition, the line at the building wrapped 3/4 around the perimeter.  It took 50 minutes to get up to the 18th floor on Mar 26.  Thankfully I had come early which got me in just on time.  There was no screening or prioritization of people based on appointment times (which I expected based on the web site).  Screening was massively delayed by nutjobs that had laptops and duffle-purses .  You can not use electronics on the 18th floor, including your cell.  So do yourself a favor and pack light. Finally, people, have your act together.  The only people that got tossed without completing the process were ones that did not have the proper paperwork.  It may sound simple, but if you do not have your birth cert or previous passport, all the pleading in the world is not going to change anything.  My favorite was Joe Businessman who was told where the nearest Kinkos was to go make copies of his ID.  The site is very precise and well documented in terms of what was needed. All in all, got what I needed, but was exhausted by the time it was done, primarily due to the unexpected waiting that I thought appointments would eliminate.
