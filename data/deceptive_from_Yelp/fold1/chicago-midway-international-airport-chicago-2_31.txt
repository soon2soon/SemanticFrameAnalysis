Midway is a pretty good airport. The security lines move swiftly, the potbelly has breakfast sandwiches and the orange line extension of the L is right there for convenient access to the city of chicago.  the only negative on this airport is the taxi service.  The taxi line is very confusing because there are separate lanes if you want to go to the city or the suburbs and if you get in a city taxi and want to go to the suburbs they charge you 1.5 times the regular rate.  Another time the lady that was working the line told me there were phones inside to call a taxi for the suburbs, i couldn't find the phones and people kept coming out and jumping in cabs ahead of me, it was very frustrating. I finally called chicago ridge taxi from my cell phone. they said they'd be there in 10 minutes and that turned into 30 but I'll save that story for their yelp page.
