The Tour had been touted as wonderful, and we weren't disppointed one bit.  We selected this company based primarily on competitive price, as they seemed more reasonable for basically the same tour.  It was a smaller more intimate boat, but still with free refreshments and ample seating in shade or sun.  Everything was as advertised.  The wealth of information was unbelievable and very entertaining.  The gal who conducted the tour was exceptionally knowledgeable and barely took time to take a breath....so much to see and learn in 90 minutes.  We'd do this again in a minute.
