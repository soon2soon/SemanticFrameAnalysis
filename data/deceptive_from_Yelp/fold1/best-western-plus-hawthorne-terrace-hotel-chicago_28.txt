We stayed overnight at Best Western Plus Hawthorne Terrace Hotel for our anniversary and it is a very pretty hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was lovely. It had old charm from back in the day.We walked a half block to Water Tower Place to Broadway Chicago to see the I Love Lucy Show. It was great, there is a lot to do around there within walking distance.
