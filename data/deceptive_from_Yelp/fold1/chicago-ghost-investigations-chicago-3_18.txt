Amazing! Had a great time, and was so happy with the tour. Turned a couple skeptics in my group into believers, caught some very interesting pictures, and even was shocked when the group came up with some names and info with the divination rods that know one there could have possibly known. Fact is, I did not even know till I read an email of a Â family newsletter with my familys history. I reccomend this tour to believers and non-believers. It's a hands on experience,and you are doing the hunting!
