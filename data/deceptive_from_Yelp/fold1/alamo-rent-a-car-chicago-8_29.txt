I was initially very unhappy with my experience renting a car from this company. I booked it through Hotline, but at the end of the trip there was a major misunderstanding about the invoice, and even though I called Alamo's national number repeatedly, and was told someone would get back to me, nobody did. However, when I finally e-mailed the O'Hare facility directly, the manager there contacted me immediately and immediately corrected everything. I was very pleased with the customer service I ultimately received from the Alamo facility at O'Hare.
