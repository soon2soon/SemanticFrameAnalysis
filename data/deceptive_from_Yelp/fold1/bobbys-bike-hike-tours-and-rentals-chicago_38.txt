Booked Bobby's Bike Hike on line about 5 days before and it was a piece of cake. Chelsea was our guide. She was very energetic and comical. We wouldn't have seen so much and learnt so much on our own.I can't wait to do it again but next time it will be the pizza,beer hotdog, cupcake ride! I couldn't convince my friends to take this one so next time I'll leave them home, ha ha! Thanks Chelsea!
