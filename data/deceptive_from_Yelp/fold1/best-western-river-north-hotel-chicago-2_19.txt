Very misleading pictures on the website, when we saw the room we immediately called for a refund but they told us that they do not give refunds but will move us to a bigger room.  I really wished I didn't book at this hotel at all.  I have much higher standards.  Next time I would rather pay extra but be in a nicer place.  Pool was dirty.
