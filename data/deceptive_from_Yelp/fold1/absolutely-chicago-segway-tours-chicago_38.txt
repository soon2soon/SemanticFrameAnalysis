The best time i've had in chicago so far! I have a cousin in from Switzerland, and this is her first time in Chicago. We decided to book a 9:00 am tour. The tour was $60 but was only $50 if you purchased online. We accidentally missed our train to the city, and we were forced to be about 10 minutes late. The gentleman who greeted us was very friendly, he warned us that if we wished to pursue the 9:00 am tour, it would have to be shortened because some of the crew already went out on the tour. He offered to push back our reservation to the 11:00 am tour, and didn't even ask for more money (an extra 30 minute tour, originally $75) I wasn't very fond of having to do this since I also wanted to show my cousin the Chicago beaches, but we did it anyways. I ended up showing her the bean, and taking pictures in Millennium park for about an hour and a half, then spending the afternoon at the beach. The 11:00 tour guide was Christian. He was awesome! He knew his facts about the city - I even learned some stuff, and I've lived in the city since 1990! Christian was so nice, polite, and always made sure we were safe (even when my switzerland cousin fell off of her segway!) He let us do our own thing, and personalize our tour by allowing us to ask questions, ask if there is anything else we wanted to see, and allowed us to cruise around buckingham fountain, grab a coffee/drink, and a hotdog! I would recommend the segway tour from Absolutely Segway in Chicago to anybody. Best tour of Chicago by far!
