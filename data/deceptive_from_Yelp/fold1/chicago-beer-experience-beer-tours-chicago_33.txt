I would HIGHLY recommend this tour - both for people visiting chicago and for locals.  I went with a group of friends - some who live in chicago and some who were visiting from out of town - and everyone thought it was an awesome way to spend an afternoon in the city. I wasn't able to drink because I'm pregnant, and even so I loved the tour.  I learned a ton about how beer is made, the different types of beer and the history of beer in chicago in particular, and I also had the chance to check out some different bars that I will definitely be visiting again in the future.  A beer tour that's fun even for someone who isn't drinking is a pretty amazing accomplishment, and I give this tour 5 stars!!
