We have used the courteous services of Chicago Majestic Limo, Inc. for over three years to great satisfaction. Every interaction, whether this be via phone, online or in person with our safe drivers, is professional, polished, clean, timely and always First Class!  We have referred many friends and family over the years, and engaged car and limo services for several corporate events.  Every experience and interaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Lisa is extremely pleasant, kind and ensures all reservations are executed with accuracy and precision. Joe, our favorite and preferred driver, is by far the best in the business!  He is always on-time, charming and the utmost professional.   It has always been said that people make or break businesses by creating positive and memorable guest experiences.  Lisa and Joe are the main reasons we continue to use and highly recommend Chicago Majestic Limo, Inc. for all transportation needs.
