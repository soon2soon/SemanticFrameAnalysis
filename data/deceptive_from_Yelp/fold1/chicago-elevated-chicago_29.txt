Took the Printer's Row/Red Light District tour in June 2011.  It was outstanding.  Margaret was funny, informative and held our interest for the full 90 minutes.  I loved hearing about this area of Chicago that I didn't know about (even though I've lived here for 30 years!). My 15-year-old niece thoroughly enjoyed it too.  Margaret blended just enough history, architecture and risque details -- in her own warm and engaging style.  Can't wait to take the other tours!
