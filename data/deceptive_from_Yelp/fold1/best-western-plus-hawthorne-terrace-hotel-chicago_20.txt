As a member of the Hilton Honors program, I expected more than I received. I had to change my room the first night due to the air not working properly. A friend in another room had to change his room because of a massive leak. He was placed in a non-Hilton room. Another night he also had problems with the air. We were compensated with two nights free. The manager never responded to my email after I returned his email. Not great customer service as far as I'm concerned. If I go back, I'll most likely look for another hotel.
