I really can't say enough about this company, I've had two fantastic experiences with them! My first experience with The Chicago Electric Boat Company was for a friend's birthday party about 6 weeks ago. Her husband organized it all, I just showed up with several others and enjoyed a fantastic cruise. We had 8 people on board and had plenty of room. I offered to be the Designated Driver and found the boat extremely easy to drive. The office staff (Caroline and Derek were on duty that night) as well as the dock hands were very helpful and made the entire experience easy and fun! This past Thursday I rented a boat to host a going away party for a friend who is moving away from Chicago. It was a perfect way for her to say goodbye to the city as well as enjoy a night with good friends. I called ahead and talked to Caroline who helped me with the reservation and said that it would be okay if we arrived a little early to enjoy a pizza on the dock before heading out - she she couldn't have been sweeter about it! Since my first visit they have an orientation video to watch (not too long, about 5 minutes) which I thought was a very helpful addition to the experience. After all, they are renting out boats here, not bikes, so learning a bit about the river traffic, examples on how to dock and other features of the boat is a good idea. Like the first time around, we had a fantastic cruise and I was so impressed with the company and concept as a whole. One other thing that I don't think any one has mentioned yet is how clean and well kept the boats are. Even coming for evening cruises at the end of the day (as both of mine were,) the boats were as good as new and are obviously well maintained. I would absolutely recommend this company to locals and tourists alike - it's a fantastic way to see a beautiful city!
