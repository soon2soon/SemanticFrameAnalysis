Great Experience !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We did the Lakeview / Lincoln Park Tour... Natalie was our tour guide and she was fantastic...... Very approachable, and knowledgeable on the beer history and the history of establishments we visited, Harrigans Pub, Paddy Long's, Bodega Ramos, Atlas Brewing Co. and Deliilahs... Great generous samplings each establishment had to offer.... My and my entourages (lol ) fave was Paddy Long's, if you love bacon and beer pairings this is the place to visit......... Thank you Bruce for offering this great outing................ David, J and Leslie...........
