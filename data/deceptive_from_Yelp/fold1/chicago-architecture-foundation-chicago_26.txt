One of my most memorable tour ever. The guide was very friendly, informative and knowledgeable. The design and architecture of the historic buildings are beautiful, unique and amazing. I highly recommended for those who like history, beautiful buildings, and walking. I learned about about our history from the 5 hours tour. Will try the boat tour next time
