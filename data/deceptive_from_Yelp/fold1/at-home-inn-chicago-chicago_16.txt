We have stayed at OT11 which is in the back of the building,with an escape exit to the alley straight from one of the bedrooms. It is on the second floor, noise level is minimal, except for the garbage truck right under your back alley window. Keep in mind it is and old building, so there are creaky noises, smells and random walls and doors everywhere. The pictures on internet are accurate and the kitchen is remodeled beautifully, but the feel of the entire place is like it was remodeled by several owners, and slapped together with a paper glue.For instance:closet doors didnt open in any of the rooms, walls in dining area leaked from the outside and a metal bedframe was bent and sticking out into the tiny walk space, the bathroom had two sinks, which is funny becasue the area is so tiny and it is obvious that each is from another remodel era, the outdoor patio is 8x8x30?, so you feel like you are sitting in a chimney - that is if you can get to it, becasue the living room couch is posiitoned to block the door...some feng shui needed here and it will be a fine place to stay! It is pricey for what you get, but the location is really great if you would like to go to Second City or Steppenwolf, Komehachi sushi and the park. or walk in any direction. Parking is generally not a problem on nearby streets. Overall I think you can get a more modern and spacious place in any of the high rises readily available in this city for this price.
