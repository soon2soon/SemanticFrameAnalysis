The Allegro is another great Kimpton Hotel, located minutes from Michigan Ave., Millennium Park, and is easily accessible to public transportation (Clark/Lake). Super friendly service, free coffee/tea in the lobby during the morning, wine happy hours in the evening, comfortable rooms, what more can you ask for. Just note, that they're currently in the middle of renovating some of the hotel, so the fitness center is closed until Feb. 1, etc.
