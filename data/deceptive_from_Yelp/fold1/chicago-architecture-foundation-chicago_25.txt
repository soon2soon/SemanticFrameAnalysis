Every time I have visited Chicago, I had taken part in one of CAF's tours and I plan to do so for all future visits.  So far, I have been on 6 walking tours and their boat tour and had a great time on each tour.  The tour guides were very knowledgeable and the buildings and sculptures were gorgeous.  Loved the boat tour around sunset, I got some great pictures from this experience.
