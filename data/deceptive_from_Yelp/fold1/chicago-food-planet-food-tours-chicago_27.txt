FANTASTIC! Â We went on the Gold Coast and Old Town tour with Angie and it was a wonderful experience, Angie was very knowledgable about the neighborhoods as well as the 7 different restaurants and stores we visited. We even saw the original Playboy Mansion - the guys loved this! Don't eat before you go on this tour because you will get lots of samples including pizza, salad, sushi, teas, oils, vinegars, chocolates and pastries. There were 14 of us on the tour and one of the ladies had been on this exact tour 2 other times and she highly recommended the other tours as well. It is well worth your time and money!
