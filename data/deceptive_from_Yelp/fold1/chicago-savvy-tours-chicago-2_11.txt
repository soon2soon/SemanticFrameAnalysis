Wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing the Groupon. Frank Lloyd Wright tour wasn't really about FLW.  The meeting place was hard to find, tour guide started 10 minutes late and was surprised that half the tour didn't show up.  They probably couldn't find the place!   I had to subdue myself from yelling 'what does this have to do with Frank Lloyd Wright?!' the majority of the tour - as none of it did.  My girlfriend told me to be nice; we should have walked away.  It was overheated, poorly facilitated, and billed as something that it wasn't.
