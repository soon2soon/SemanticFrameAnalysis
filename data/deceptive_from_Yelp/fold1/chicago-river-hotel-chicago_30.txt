This hotel is amazing. It's literally in the middle of everywhere you will want to be in the city. My room has an amazing view. It was very inexpensive compared to the hotels surrounding (ex. Hard rock and the trump tower) but you know if your hotel is next to trump tower than its a great location. I'm planning on eating at the restaurant downstairs tomorrow which I'm sure is great bc it definitely smells like it will be. Free wifi, kuerig in the room. Small room but perfect for one person or a couple. Absolutely nothing to complain about it. I will definitely be back.
