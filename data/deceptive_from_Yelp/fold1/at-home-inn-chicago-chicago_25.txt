This is the second year in a row that our group of six from Cincinnati rented the entire Maud House in Lincoln Park from At Home Inn.  The accommodations were perfect as the house included a court yard for outdoor entertaining, grilling, etc.  It was also convenient to restaurants and to the Ell for transportation to Wrigley Field.  Every one in our group want to repeat this trip every year, but only if we can stay at the Maud House.  In fact, the only way it could be better was if it had more bedrooms and we could invite more friends.
