Groupon got us on this tour, which we have been wanting to take for years.  Nice to sit back and take it all in, visiting pockets of the city we hadn't explored before.  Guide was informative and just cheesy enough to be ok.  Worked respectfully with the driver.  The number of movies and sites were extensive and we are looking forward to seeing several movies we haven't seen.  Delightful way to spend an afternoon.  Glad to support a family business.  Nice job!
