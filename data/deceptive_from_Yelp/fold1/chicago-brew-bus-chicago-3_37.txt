I've taken the tour over a month ago and I have to say it's a pretty genius concept.  Being able to sample craft beers that you normally wouldn't be able to try unless you drove yourself, and even then you're intoxicated by the end.  With The Chicago Brew Bus, you don't have to worry about driving because they take you from brewery to brewery. I had a wonderful time and highly recommend it if you want to have a good time and learn a lil something about craft beers as well as some Chicago history with beer.  The staff is also very nice and knowledgeable and makes sure you have a great time, which also makes it an A+
