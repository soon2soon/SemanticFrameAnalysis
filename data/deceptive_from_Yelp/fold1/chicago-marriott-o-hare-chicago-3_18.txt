The hotel itself was excellent. Stayed in concierge and the food was great and the room was clean. My issue with this hotel was my girlfriend's gold ring was stolen out of her jewelry box while we were in Chicago for the day. The door was closed and locked when we left, and the ring was in the box when we left in the morning. When we flew back to Boston, I contacted lost & found and they basically have done nothing to help. Only saying that they have searched the room and found nothing. Well, I did the same thing before we left and obviously I didn't find it, so why would you? Just be careful while staying here because the room service is untrustworthy.
