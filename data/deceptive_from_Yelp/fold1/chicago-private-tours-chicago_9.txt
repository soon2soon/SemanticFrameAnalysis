We hired Chicago Private Tours for a city tour for out of town spanish-speaking guests for our wedding.  On the day of the tour the Spanish speaking guide was unwell and could not do the tour.  To make up for it our guest got a great tour in English (with some guests translating for others) and were able to do an additional river/lake cruise.  They really enjoyed the tour and had wonderful things to say about the guide. We really appreciate that Chicago Private Tours went out of their way to make this a great experience for our guests, even in the face of unexpected difficulties.  What an example of really great customer service!
