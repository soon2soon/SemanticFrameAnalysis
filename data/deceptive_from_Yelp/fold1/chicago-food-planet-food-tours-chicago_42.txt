As a recent visitor to Chicago, I went on this food and architecture tour of Bucktown & Wicker Park with my son.  We both loved the food, the walk, the shops, and the tour itself.  This tour combines the best of everything: a pleasant walk through beautiful neighborhoods and stopping to eat delicious food throughout the day.  Our tour guide Kent was the perfect combination of professionalism and quirky humor. The pace was perfect, neither rushed nor too slow.  The food was of course delicious and varied, and there was so much of it that I ended up bringing home leftovers.  I expected the food, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed all the walks through lovely neighborhoods and learning about the individual homes, and their histories.   My son loved the tour as much as I did, and he is a resident of the area.   I cannot recommend this tour enough.
