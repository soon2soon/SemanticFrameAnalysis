This was a great place to stay.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable.  The price was reasonable for the area.  I am giving it a 4 because there were elevator issues while we were there and that was inconvenient. The parking garage is narrow and winding and difficult!  Recommend public transportation.
