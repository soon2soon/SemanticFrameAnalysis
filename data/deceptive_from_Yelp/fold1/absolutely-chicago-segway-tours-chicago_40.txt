We are new to Chicago and my best friend came to visit. We all took the Museum tour on Sat., July 16th, and had a wonderful time. It gave me a chance to familiarize myself with a portion of the city and allowed my friend to experience several popular destinations. I've always wanted to try the Segways and had I known what a great time it is, I would have done it sooner!
