i needed a reasonably priced place to stay for the weekend, and this place was perfect, the location couldn't be better, they have an awesome game room with pool table, fussball, tv. I got the room with 4 beds, I was there with my family, it was sooooo spacious. Everything was awesome!!! I would definately will recomend this place to any body heading to the windy city.
