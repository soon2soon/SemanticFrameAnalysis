This is a great way to spend to spend 3 1/2 hours in the afternoon. Chris knows loads about beer and is happy to answer a million and one questions. I went with a mate and its was great to be in a mixed group to interact with on the tour. We met at Goose Island sampled four different types of beer before getting on board the bus and going to Moonshine for another set of 4 x 4oz samples and finally to Revolution where you are able to see around the production site and sample some more beers. You can always buy more if you really like a particular brand. Thumbs up from a UK visitor
