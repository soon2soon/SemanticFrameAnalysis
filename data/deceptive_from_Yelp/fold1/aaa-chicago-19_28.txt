Club Assist Road Service towed my husband's car.  Before the mechanical work was done, we realized that several canes and other valuables were missing.  AAA will contact the company but claims to be exempt of liability.  When you have your car towed under the auspices of AAA, you don't expect them to contract or send thieves or criminals to respond to your emergencies.
