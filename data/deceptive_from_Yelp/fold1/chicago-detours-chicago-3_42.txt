I have never taken the time to sit and write a review, but this called for some attention.  We had a great time.  The Pedway Tour in January was the best.  I'm from Chicago and have lived here all my life and still Amanda showed me things that I have never seen before.  Sometimes we are in a hurry and dealing the hustle and bustle of the city and we never notice the fine details.  It will help you look at Chicago in a different light.  Take the tour and have fun with the iPads and hearing the great stories.  We took our 3 children ages 13 and 16 and they loved it too.  I loved that they learned about my favorite city.
