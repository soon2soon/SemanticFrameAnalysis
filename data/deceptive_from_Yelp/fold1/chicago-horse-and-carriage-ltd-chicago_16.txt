I didn't even get the chance to experience the ride due to the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  When looking into the possibliity of using CHC for a short ride, an hour at the absolute maximum (more than enough time), I was quite surprised at how much they wanted to charge.  I was so irked I basically told them how insulted I was and felt they were taking advange of couples wanting to reserve for their wedding day.  I also mentioned that I didn't think their carriages were the best looking for the money...she didn't like that comment at all!  The lady who replied to my response was so rude and obviously lacking in professionalism.  I'm guessing her manager doesn't know how out of line she was...if they did maybe they would fire her immediately.  I would not recommend CHC...anyone looking  to use them for your wedding should go elsewhere.
