Affinia Chicago is one of a few business and leisure hotels I've stayed at while in Chicago -- I've been here for both. I booked the Studio Suite at getaroom.com; the rate I got was far from rock bottom but at least it was cheaper than what I saw on other booking sites. I really had no real complaints other than the internet fee -- I honestly hadn't been to a hotel that charges for internet use in a long time. The drinks at the bar are, you guessed it, pricey. Check-in is a tad slow, as are the property's elevators. However, the hotel also gets a star for good service.
