Customer service is definitely a priority at the Carlton Inn Midway! My first trip to Chicago and Carlton Inn employees helped make it a great one. Valerie went above and beyond gathering information for me that answered all my questions and made navigating Chicago very easy. I stayed in a smoking room which is smaller but besides that everything was great! I see some bad reviews talking about the area and I braced myself...however there was nothing AT ALL scary or strange about the area. In fact in was well situated to local eating and shopping. I will definitely stay here again!! Breakfast on the open air patio was great!
