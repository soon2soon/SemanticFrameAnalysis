My friend and I spent a long weekend in Chicago and took the Lakefront Neighborhoods tour on Saturday morning and it was AMAZING!! Our tourguide was very knowledgeable, likeable, and just wanted our entire group to be safe and have a great time. He was great and I learned even more about Chicago's history when we sat down for a water break at Lincoln Park. So much fun!! The tour was reasonably priced plus a student discount and the description about the mileage and riding difficulty/easiness was right on. I didn't bring kids but there was a little girl on tour with her parents and the bike ride was very safe for children! (two seater type of bike) Go Bobby's Bike Hike! I will definitely be doing this again when I return for the Taste of Chicago. *wear sunscreen, bring water, and your camera!!!**
