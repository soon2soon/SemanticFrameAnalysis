Overpriced--we paid $189/night--and oversold. This is not a low-service hotel, it's a no-service hotel. No maid service, no bellman, no reasonable help of any kind. What's good about it: The location is excellent. The neighborhood is beautiful and convenient. The hotel is moderately clean and appears to be safe, although the lobby is unattended at night and in the early morning. What's not so good. 1. The lobby is bare and ugly. 2. The rooms are cramped and ours was dark as well (although rooms facing the street would likely be brighter than ours, which faced a brick wall). 3. The bathrooms are not small, they are tiny, dingy, old and inconvenient. The hairdryer works, but just barely. 4. The elevators are claustrophobic but seemed to function. 5. Staff wasn't rude but wasn't very helpful either. 6. Other than a decent workout room, there are no facilities of any kind. There is no bellman, concierge, room service, restaurant, or lobby meeting area of any kind. 7. There is no maid service at all. Beds are not made. Towels aren't replaced. Nothing is cleaned during the stay. Bottom line. At a price under a $120/night this would be a reasonable place to stay. At $189/night it was overpriced. Next time, I'll happily pay an additional $50/night to stay down the street at a large chain hotel.
