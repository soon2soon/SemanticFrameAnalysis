I took the tour a couple of months ago and I have to say I had a GREAT time! It was nice to get to sample different types of brews around the city of Chicago. Kevin definitely knows his beers. I'd recommend anyone to go on this tour, a great way to see the city, drink some good beers and hang with friends, Oh! and not having to worry about driving. BREW BUS ROCKS!!!
