***AAA IS NOT RELIABLE ****** AAA IS NOT RELIABLE ***** AAA IS NOT RELIABLE AND SIMPLY NOT RELIABLE.   After many years of carrying AAA, I have dumped them for unreliability.  I live in Chicago where auto towing is abundant.  In one occasion on a beautiful, clear summer day my car broke down in the central district of the City.  It took them more than 5ive hours for assistance to reach me. I gave them another shot.   I continued to renew my membership of $90.00 a year. Two years later my car got a flat tire, Fortunately my car was in my garage.  Again the weather was nice and clear on a winter afternoon. When I reached AAA  for assistance they informed that the wait was over 5ive hours.  At least this time they informed me ahead of time.  What more than 5ive hours to fix a flat???? I don't live in the mountains.  The weather was good.  Immediately cancelled my membership and requested a full refund.   After more than 10 years of membership with AAA Auto club I can sincerely tell you to look elsewhere. @@@--- AAA IS NOT RELIABLE@@@ ---AAA IS NOT RELIABLE@@@----AAA IS NOT RELIABLE@@@-----
