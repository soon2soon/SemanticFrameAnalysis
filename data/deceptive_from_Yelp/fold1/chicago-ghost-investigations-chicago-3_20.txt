This was a true paranormal experience. I've been on two other ghost tours once before--one in Charleston and one here--and all we did was stop at bars and cemeteries and hear stories about ghosts. No encounters and no equipment at all. This was by far the best tour - it is similar to what you see on the paranormal shows -- your guide teaches you to use equipment to find the spirits and shows you how to use dowsing rods to chat with them. It is not scary at all - it's fun and a little eerie in a good way - like great for a Halloween event, a fun outing with colleagues from work or a great date! If you are interested in the paranormal in general, you will want to come back A LOT...it is that good. On our tour, we spoke with an American Indian from the 1800s, an older man who died in his 80s, and some of our group's "BYOG" (bring your own ghost) ghosts. There was no lack of ghosts!  Two of the people in our group were skeptics and afterwards said, "This was real."  That was an eye-opener for me. Be sure to bring a camera - nobody in our group remembered to bring one - and the ghosts can and apparently do show up on video or camera. Some of the photos in the office were wild! One other thing I liked about this tour - afterwards, they try to research the people you have communicated with and verify the information through public records. I highly recommend this tour. It's one of those amazing experiences you will never forget. This is a must-attend event! It's a blast!
