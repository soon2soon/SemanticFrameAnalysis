It was insightful, educational and not your typical tour. My experience was eye-opening. I spoke with a spirit name Catherine, who lived in the 1900's and died of natural causes, she was a singer. Is this real, or was I forcing the outcome? Â What I do know, that was an experience I will never forget.
