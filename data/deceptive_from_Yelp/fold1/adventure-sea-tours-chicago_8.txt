We had a Chicago Skyline Cruise for a party celebrating graduation from Northwestern University. Â Our event aboard the Valara VI was outstanding. Mary was absolutely thorough and professional in assisting the planning of the evening. The ship was comfortable and welcoming to our party of 60 people. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. The captain and the crew managed the entire cruise flawlessly and courteously. Truly, it was a magical evening. I would recommend Adventure Sea Tours, Inc. and the yacht Valara for anyone looking to plan something special with a unique venue.
