Jamie, our tour guide, was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  The Segway tour was a great way to see the city and get to know the history behind it!  As a local, I would recommend it to locals and visitors alike! I can't wait to go back again!  The tour was 3 hours, but there were a few stops to get off the Segway and stretch and even take a bathroom/snack break!  The only issue is on google maps it puts the place in front of the trump tower, but its actually on the corner of Wabash and upper Wacker drive in a small stand alone building.  Enjoy!
