This place is one of those rare combinations of right price, right location, and right quality.  Steps from the Pulaski elevated train stop; 20 minutes to the heart of downtown.  Free Midway Airport shuttle van.  Free parking. The three times I've stayed here the rooms have been immaculately maintained, which likely accounts for their AAA 2-diamond rating.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. No thrills, nothing fancy, just clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location close to Midway yet easily accessible to downtown and McCormick Place.  Oh, and the Mexican restaurant just a few minutes walk to the east of the hotel has fantastic, cheap food.
