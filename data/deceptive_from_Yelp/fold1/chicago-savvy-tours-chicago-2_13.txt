I went on the Chicago interiors tour. First, out guide was a really cool 20-something with a great knowledge of architecture, which was welcome because I was expecting a stuffy professor-type. I've lived in the city my whole life, and I learned things about buildings I pass by and go into every day that really amazed me. Who knew that the Chicago Historical society has ceilings by Tiffany?
