All I can say is THANK YOU to all of you who went here to review this place...really reviewing the entire procedure.  I am such a rule follower that I was convinced, after talking to numerous government employees, that the only way for me to renew my passport in the week-window I had was to drive to Detroit or Minneapolis (7 hours in either direction!) because those were the "closest" offices with available appointments. I suppose if they said walk-ins were welcome they would be swamped.  So again, thanks, to all of you who shared your walk-in success stories.  Mine was much the same.  Got there at 9:20 for the 10:00 opening.  Was "screened" and given a cue number by 9:50.  Done with the whole procedure by 10:15.  Since I had a whole week left before my flight I was told my new passport would be ready the next day.  Happy to do that so all of my line buddies who were flying today and tomorrow could get their passports the same afternoon.  So relieved!!!
