We reserved 4 comfort bikes online for a September Saturday bike ride from the Navy Pier location.  When we got there we were told that they did not have the comfort bikes, that we could ride over on uncomfortable bikes to another rental location approx. a mile away to trade out for the comfort bikes.  So we rode out of our way and when we got to the other location we were told 'sorry, no comfort bikes for you, the only ones available were there for a tour group!'  By the way, no one at either location seemed to care about customer service.  Finally one young man gave us the bikes we had reserved and we went on our way.   One of the bikes had a tire blowout near the end of our ride, and had to walk back to the rental location.  Again, the personnel merely rolled eyes and sighed when my husband complained about the whole bike rental experience.  A manager handed him two coupons for 2 hr. future bike rental - we won't be using since we're from San DIego... If you want to have a good bike rental experience, DO NOT rent from this outfit.
