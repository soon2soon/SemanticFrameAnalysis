I have lived in the city for four years and cannot get enough of its rich heritage and present day brags. This tour was a perfect blend of both. We learned new information about old places, and the in-laws from Oklahoma enjoyed the casually-paced stroll through beautiful neighborhoods.History was made personal on this tour. Edgy and fun.
