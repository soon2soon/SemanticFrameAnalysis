After receiving a phone message the day before I was set to arrive in Chicago with the news that the brownstone I had arranged to rent was no longer available due to problems with the facility, I was primed to write a poor review of the company.  However, Francine assured me that they had a property available for me that was within a block of my original booking and that it was an upgrade.  It turned out that she was certainly right.  Instead of the of the Studio that I had originally booked, I was shown to a beautifully appointed one bedroom unit in the same part of town that I had arranged for originally. Kudos, At Home Chicago, for turning lemons into lemonade.  I'll definitely be in contact the next time I'm working or playing in Chicago!
