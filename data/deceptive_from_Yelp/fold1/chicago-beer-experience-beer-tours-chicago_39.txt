OK, so I like to drink beer. Who doesn't? But I'm always the girl who orders Miller Lite because it's cheap and I don't know enough about beer to care. Then some friends and I decided to try something new one night and took the tour with Chicago Beer Experience. It was awesome. I learned so much about beer (like, uh, what an "ale" is...yeah, I was beer ignorant before), but I also learned how its history ties in so much to the history of Chicago. It's really interesting stuff and even though I'm a local, it's information I never knew before. The tour guide was awesome - really nice, really knowledgeable, really passionate about everything he spoke about - and the beer was amazing. Did I mention there's bacon? Because there is...paired with beer. If that's not a perfect pairing, I don't know what is. Anyways, it was a really fun tour. Whether you're a local or in town visiting, I highly recommend it. It's nice doing something different for a change, especially when it involves fun people, and interesting topic and plenty of tasty beer.
