Staying there this Friday after staying there 2 years ago and had an awful experience. In hotels defense last time major construction all nite was not their fault but they could have given a fair warning. On to the next stay. Was checking rates and the room I got is now over $60 cheaper I booked through the hotel and called them pointing this out but they told me since I made reservations online I could not get out of the rate I was at. Okay. That's fine. But I want everyone to know not to book online for this hotel. Hope they enjoy my stay I am going to make it as accommodating as they were to me
