My husband and I have done both the Bucktown/Wicker Park and Gold Coast/Old Town tours.  Both are excellent.  The Bucktown/Wicker Park tour has much more food  included. (I was unable to finish everything).  I really enjoyed learning so much that I didn't know about the city that I lived in for 12 years. Strongly recommend these tours!!
