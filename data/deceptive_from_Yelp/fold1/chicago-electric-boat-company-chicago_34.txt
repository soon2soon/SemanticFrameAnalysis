I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone visiting or living in the Chicago area. I went out on a boat from 7-9pm on Friday night with my family and had an absolute blast. When we arrived the staff was friendly and very accommodating. We had preordered catering from one of their partners and when we were taken to our boat, it was waiting for us with napkins, plates and utensils. We brought a few extra snacks and a bottle wine and had a perfect evening. Driving through the Chicago waterways was beautiful at night and it allowed us to see the city from a different view. The boats are very easy to drive, but I would just make sure you have a cautious driver as there are other larger tour boats driving through the waterway. The price does seem a little high but if you get a group of people to split the cost with, it ends up being just as expensive as going out to dinner and drinks at a restaurant. I can't wait for another visit to Chicago to book a trip on a Chicago Electric Boat again!
