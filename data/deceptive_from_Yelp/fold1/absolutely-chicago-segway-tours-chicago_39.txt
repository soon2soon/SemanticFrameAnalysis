I would definitely recommend absolutely Segway . My tour guide was Emily , she was very fun, knowledgeable and was extremely patient in teaching us how to ride a Segway . One lady was having difficulties and she took her aside and patiently showed her how to properly operate her Segway . I have recommended this tour to everyone who asks about what they should do when they visit chicago and I can't wait to do another one . Thank you Emily and Â absolutely Segway !
