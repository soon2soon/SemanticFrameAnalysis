Amanda knows her city.  She has worked with Rick Steves of the Travel through the Back Door fame in Italy, so she has tour guide experience.  She has taken courses in art, architecture and history with a focus toward her hometown, and she shares it well.  Taking the tour on a chilly, blustery, rainy day, we really appreciated the chance to walk the Pedway, which some natives on the tour didn't even know existed.  It was great to have access to the iPads to get some extra background and photos while we visited sites. It wasn't too long nor included too much walking if you need to keep that in consideration.  I'll take the tour again the next time I visit Chicago as I am sure she will have more to teach me.
