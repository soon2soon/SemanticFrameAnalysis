I just went on the Bikes,bites,and brews tour from Bobby's Bike Tour in Chicago. It was Awesome!!!!!!!!!! Alex our tour guide was fantastic,she knew all about Chicago. She made the tour fun and funny,and she made everyone feel welcome. The food at Gino's East,Swirlz,Murphy's was delicious. The Brews at goose Island were unique and very tasty. So next time I am in Chicago,and will book another tour with Bobby's give you the special treatment. So everyone go and take a Bike tour of the great city of Chicago Bobby's.
