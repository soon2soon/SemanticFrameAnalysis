I use midway about four times a month between Minneapolis/St. Paul and Chicago. It's very convenient for travel anywhere in the city. Buses, trains and cabs make getting to your destination a breeze. Sometimes the security lines can be long but usually no longer then 15 minutes. Southwest is the best airline there is and affordable. Such a useful airport for frequent travelers. Love Midway airport!
