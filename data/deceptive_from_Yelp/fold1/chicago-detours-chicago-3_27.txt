OUTSTANDING!  I enjoyed every minute of the Inside the Loop tour.  Neil our tour guide was so informative.  You could feel his love of the city and how much he enjoyed telling us about the history and architecture of Chicago.  6 of us from Franklin Park were joined by 3 other people which made it a nice small group so we could ask a lot of questions.  We shared 3 I pads to help envision how the city used to look  which was great.  I lived in the suburbs all my life and  I learned so much on this tour.  The highlights were the Chicago Methodist Temple and The Cultural Center, they were so beautiful. The view of Mellenium Park from the Cultural Center was neat.  My friends and I can't wait to sign up for another tour.  Lots of fun.
