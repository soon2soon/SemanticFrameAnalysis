At first this place sounded great, cheaper than most places with cheaper parking too. Once we got there the front desk told us about parking options and we felt like he was ripping us off. Sending us way down the road to get a money order for parking...strange. We figured it out ourselves for cheaper. Our room cards never worked to get into the hotel. Our actual room smelled like sewer the entire 3 days. The floor had a sticky residue on it that got all over our bags, shoes and feet - gross. Our bed was comfortable but the comforter had a bunch of tears in it. The couch had black stains all over and so we sat on a blanket on the couch. I have NO idea how this place has the rating it does. I was scared every time we got in the elevator as well! It creaked and dropped and such - maybe it's just old. Keep this as a last option folks. Or check your room keys to make sure they work, check your room first, and know that there is no breakfast offered and stale coffee. I would have left the first night but it was non-refundable.
