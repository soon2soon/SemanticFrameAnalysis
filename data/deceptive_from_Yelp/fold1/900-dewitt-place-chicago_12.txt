This place also doubles as a hotel of sorts when they have empty apartments. I stayed here for an overnight trip into the city and got a great price for what was provided. They are fully furnished studios including a full sized kitchen and cook ware. Pros: the prices was great. The location was pretty good with it being right off the lake. The apartment itself was very clean and nice. We were able to cook our own meals while staying that saved us a bit of money. The amount of room that we had was great enough room we didn't feel confined like some other hotels I've stayed at. Lots of windows that provide great lighting. The beds were comfy. Cons: The bathroom was very small and the tub. The tub was crazy tall like almost couldn't get into it tall my friend attempted to sit in it and almost couldn't get out. The elevators are a death trap waiting to happen old 1920s elevators. The apartment we were in didn't have a great view and we were stuck looking at a building worried someone would see us naked. The WiFi was shitty but we weren't there much so it didn't matter. All in all I'd stay again especially if they updated the bathrooms then I'd consider staying every time I'm in the city.
