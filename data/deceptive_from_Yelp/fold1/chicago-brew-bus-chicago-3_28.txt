The tastings and the bus rides were pure entertainment! My friend and I did the tour this past weekend. We started at Goose Island then went to Haymarket Brewery and ended at Lake Effect. The tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. I HIGHLY recommend this tour, even if you don't love beer. They have something for everyone. My friend and I are both from out of town and the tour guide was very helpful in recommending other places for us to visit after the tour. We had a great time and we owe it to the Brew Bus guys! Do yourself a favor - Spend the money and go on the Brew Bus Tour. You won't regret it!
