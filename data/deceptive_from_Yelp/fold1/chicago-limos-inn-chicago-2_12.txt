I am not someone to complain about service even when it is bad, but Chicago limos Inn was the worst limo experience of my life.  We booked them for my wedding day on September 6th, 2013.  The limo driver showed up early and told one of my friends that we needed to hurry, because he is only getting paid for the hour and has to be somewhere else.  Then we got into the limo and the a/c was practically pumping out warm air.  Not a good start.  the limo driver proceeded to the wedding which was in the city, and we were coming from the suburbs.  He was going as fast as he could and weaving in and out of traffic on the highway, having a couple close calls.  The only reason I didn't give one star is because he showed up to pick us up.  Thanks
