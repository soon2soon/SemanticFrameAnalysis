I stayed here numerous times over the course of my Anime Expo stays! It's a great hotel and very charming for those who are enchanted by the old architecture and Hollywood glamor days.Security and staff are nice enough though I found the rooms to be small but considering the location, it's expected. It's not too close to everything and parking is a pain but the hotel does help when it's a huge event like Expo and even give you bus vouchers! It was great overall!
