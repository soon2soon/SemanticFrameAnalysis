I was in charge of my friends' wedding transportation from their house to a nice little venue in Evanston. I made a reservation with Best Chicago limousine and everything went according to plan. Â They even made a detour to the Baha'i temple for some pics. They were on time and very courteous. You pay for it, but it's all worth it!
