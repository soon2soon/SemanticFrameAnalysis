I took the tour last month during my visit to Chicago and loved it! I actually haven't seen too many movies, but took the tour anyway. Our guide Jess was hilarious and really knowledgeable about Chicago and the films. It didn't even matter that I hadn't seen any of the movies - I felt super informed at the end of the tour. I really liked that the bus picked us up right near the Rock 'n Roll McDonalds, and across from the Rainforest Cafe Downtown Chicago where I ate dinner later that evening. A+ would recommend this tour to anyone.
