i thought the guide was entertaining and that the bus driver was the master of chicago traffic, but outside of that i was not impressed. the entire tour was given from inside the bus, which bothered me a bit.  quite a few of the actual movie scenes were shot inside the buildings, so you don't any sort of recognition when you're staring blankly at the outside of the building it was shot in.   the time you have to absorb the location of the actual scene is paced with traffic flow.  so there might be a 5 minute buildup, but if that light is green you have only a few seconds to try and catch a glimpse of the actual spot... it was probably the only time i'll ever hope for more traffic.   the bus was kind of bigger too so if you're on the left side and the scene is on your right you're pretty much out of luck. i feel like they tried to cram as many movies in as possible, which i'm sure is what some people are looking for, but i would've rather they cut some of the lesser known ones out and give us some time in a few locations.  maybe take some pictures where chicago transforms into gotham or see the inside of the magnificent bank they used in public enemies.
