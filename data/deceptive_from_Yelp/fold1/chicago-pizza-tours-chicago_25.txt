Sis planned the tour for her hubby, myself & herself as we all love pizza. The magical pizza journey began at Pizano's with three additional unique adventures into pizza greatness. Be sure to arrive with an appetite as there with be plenty of pizza served. Each stop offers a different type of pizza with a history lesson along the way. Water is served at each stop with the opportunity to purchase soft drinks or alcohol. It was a nice way to enjoy the sights of the city along the way while being provided a historical background. Being originally a Chicago area native I knew something was amiss when the tour guide gave his information regarding the lions to the entrance to The Art Institute of Chicago. Hopefully, he was having an off day & will look into their significance. Overall, he did an excellent job & we would recommend the tour to everyone!
