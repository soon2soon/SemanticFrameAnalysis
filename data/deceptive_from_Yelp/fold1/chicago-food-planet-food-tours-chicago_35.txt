My mother and I went on the Bucktown/Wicker Park tour and thought it was great! Our tour guide, Kent, was awesome! He knew so much about the neighborhoods and the food stops. He did a wonderful job as our guide! The food samples were all delicious. We thought all the stops on the tour provided good food. The food samples throughout the tour will definitely leave you full so be prepared to eat! I would highly recommend this tour to others!
