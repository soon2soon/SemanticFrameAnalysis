This place is a total ripoff. Here is what happened: I made reservations for three nights and prepaid more than $700. My flight in Denver was canceled and I came in a day late and called the hotel to warn them. When I got there they said, "no worries," you will pay for two days. Yet I never got a refund and today I was billed ANOTHER $197 for parking and THREE DAYS OF CITY ROOM TAXES. The explanation: the "internet" rates are non refundable and cannot be changed. Does it say this on the BW website? NO. This is criminal and this is the SECOND time I have been overcharged at this hotel. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
