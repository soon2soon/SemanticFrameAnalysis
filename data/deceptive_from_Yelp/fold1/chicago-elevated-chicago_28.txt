Took the Printer's Row/Red LIght tour on an extremely warm Sat.in July, 2011.  Margaret was informative, funny, told great stories and really knew her architectural history of the area.  She gave us a nice blend of building styes and personal stories of characters and architects of the time.  Would definitely recommend this tour for out-of-towners and Chicagoans alike.
