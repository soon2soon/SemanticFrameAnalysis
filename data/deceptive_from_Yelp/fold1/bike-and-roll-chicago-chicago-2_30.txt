A group of my friends and I went down from Madison to do the Segway tour.  We had seen it advertised through Groupon. We were very impressed with Anthony our guide.  He took the time needed to ensure that each of us knew what to do before we started the tour.  We had plenty of time to 'practice' on our own. We really enjoyed the informational part of the tour... Anthony was very knowledgable and answered all our questions.  Wished we could have had a few 'picture' stops since it was a beautiful day; but I think if we would have asked (didn't think of it at the time) he would have obliged. Didn't realize how much our feet would hurt.  But if you get off the segway periodically during the tour, it helps. Highly recommend trying out the segway tour - if us 'oldies but goodies' can do it, you can too!
