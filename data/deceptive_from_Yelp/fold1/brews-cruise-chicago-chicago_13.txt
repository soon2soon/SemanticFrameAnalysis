Me and my boyfriend recently did the tour and we had such a great time! it was so much fun and so interesting to learn about the process of making beer. We were able to sample so many different kinds of beers so if you love trying new beers and love beer in general, i definitely recommend the tour. The tour guide is great and was extremely knowledgeable about beer. It is a great deal, you get a lot out of it for the price :).
