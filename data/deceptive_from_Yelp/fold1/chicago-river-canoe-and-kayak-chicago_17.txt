Yeah! Flipping kayaking and junk! Went over the 4th of July weekend, opted to do it up here to avoid the potential of things bring throw at us from patrons of the Cubs/ Sox game, the Taste, and just general 4th rowdiness. Glad we did- $15/hr and a super relaxing tour. The people running it were really nice and helpful to my fiance who had never kayaked before. They assured him that he wouldn't tip into the what he called "poo water". And no, he didn't tip.
