Called AAA and got a great deal on homeowner's and car insurance.  Then they send me a letter in December saying I need to fix cracks in my driveway by February or they will cancel my policy.  Now mind you I don't have an issue with filling the cracks but need appropriate weather.  So I call them and ask them what they want me to do with the snow and ice on the ground. They told me to get a back hoe and move it.  LOL.  Who fixes concrete cracks in the dead of winter with ice and snow on the ground!!  Before they could terminate me............I terminated them!!!
