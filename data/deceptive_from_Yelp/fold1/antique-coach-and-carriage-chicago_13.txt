Why the hell there is a horse hauling a large man in a carriage in a very busy area in the city with several grocery stores nearby and tons of car traffic is beyond me. The animal looked elderly and exhausted. I have heard these animals are treated poorly and overworked, it was very apparent when I saw this today. A horse drawn carriage ride is not "romantic", it's cruel. These animals do not belong in busy car traffic.
