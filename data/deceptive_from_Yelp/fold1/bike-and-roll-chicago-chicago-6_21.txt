Last week my husband and I took advantage of a Groupon offer to do the Segway Tour of Hyde Park.  We were greeted at the Bike Shop by the staff.  They were very helpful.  Vincent, our guide, was wonderful.  He gave us lessons to familiarize us with the Segway.  Vincent was very encouraging and, with his help,  the Segway was surprisingly easy to ride.  Since we were the only two on the tour it was like a private tour.  Vincent's enthusiasm for Hyde Park, his hometown, was contagious. We would highly recommend this fun way to learn more about Chicago.
