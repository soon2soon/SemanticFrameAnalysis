They have horrible customer service.  When you call, they don't answer the phone and they don't return phone calls.  If you try to book reservations online their website gives you errors in different areas. In addition to leaving them a message, I emailed them...and they didn't respond until Monday. Well that doesn't help when you are trying to reserve for a Sunday Bike and Segway Ride.
