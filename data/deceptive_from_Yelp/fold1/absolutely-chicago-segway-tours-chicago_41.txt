My wife and 16 yr old daughter booked the 2 1/2 hr afternoo tour Sunday July 10th. We had a blast our guide"Eric" was excellent. The segways were so much fun to ride and we cannot wait to do it again. I will say this much there is allot of people in the areas we rode in so you definately have pay attention while having FUN. Our next trip I think will be the evening tour. There are other rentals available and I cannot speak for them but Absolutely Tours was great, everyone was friendly and polite.
