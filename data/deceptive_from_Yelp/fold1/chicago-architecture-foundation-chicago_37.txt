We took the boat tour and it was amazingly fun and educational. Our guide was humorous yet professional which made it pleasurable. Make sure your iPhone or memory card isn't close to full because there will be lots of fantastic photo ops! If you go during the summer make sure you wear sunscreen and a hat because you'll want to be on the deck for the best views. CAF has other tours as well, which we can't wait to do next time we're in town. If you get a chance to stop at their store they have great items to pick up so have your credit card in hand ;)
