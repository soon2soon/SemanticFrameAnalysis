We stayed here for two nights while in Chicago. I was looking for something relatively cheap and in a good location, meaning close to the well-known tourist attractions. This place was perfect, given its close vicinity to the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, etc. The rooms are more like one-bedroom apartments, given that the place is intended for extended stays. Our room had a comfortable queen bed and a sofa with a pull-out, the bathroom was basic, but it was clean, and it was nice having a fridge and dishes so we could save money by bringing back leftovers. Finally, the woman in the office upon our arrival and the concierge were both extremely friendly and helpful. The only downside, and this was completely my fault for not thinking ahead, was that with the limited office hours (M-F, 9-6), we couldn't leave our bags anywhere after checking out on Sunday so we could spend more time walking around the city. I would recommend planning ahead if any special accommodations will be needed during times when the office is closed.
