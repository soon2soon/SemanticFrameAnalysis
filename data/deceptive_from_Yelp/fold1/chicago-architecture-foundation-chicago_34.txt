Standing outside the Chicago Architecture Foundation, the views were fabulous. On one side is the Hollywood Sign and the other is the panaramic view of Chicago. The Chicago Architecture Foundation is free and immaculate. There are three telescopes outdoors for Saturn and our moon. We popped inside for only a moment as we ran out of time. I would like to go again to see more of the Chicago Architecture Foundation.
