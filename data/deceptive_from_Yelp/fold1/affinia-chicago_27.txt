We recently had our wedding at Affinia hotel on the roof top (C-view) It was a dream come true!! We worked with Allison (catering, sales manager) She was so wonderful to work with!!  My husband proposed to me on the top deck also back in April, and she helped him arrange everything!! Allison and her staff don't  miss a detail!  The staff at Affinia are all so great to work with and very dedicated!! We chose to serve canapes for the dinner and everything was so delicious!  Our guests all loved these!!  It was more fun and casual than a sit down dinner! This is our second time staying at Affinia Hotel, We love this place!! Very clean and everyone is so friendly!! We had our dream wedding in a place we love!!
