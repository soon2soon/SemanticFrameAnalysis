I bought a gift certificate for a surprise to my boyfriend of 10 years.  I had big plans for our Anniversary weekend.  I have paid for this certificate back in March 2014  and have not yet seen the real Gift Certificate.  I have emailed the company 3 times and called several times and no one will answer the phone or respond to emails.  So I guess they can take all the money and never provide any service.  All you get when you call is a message asking for your help to keep the Company going.   Why on earth would I help a company that steals peoples money.   It makes me sick that you can do this to people and get away with it .
