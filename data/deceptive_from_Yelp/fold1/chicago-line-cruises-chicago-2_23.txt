My family went on the boat tour this past weekend. We had a difficult time deciding what to do, so we consulted the concierge at the hotel for recommendations. We decided on the boat tour. Great. Spectacular. Wonderful. We're all history buffs and were genuinely interested in the tour. My parents are over 55, so they were considered 'Seniors', and my younger brother is still 18, so he was considered a 'Child,' leaving me the only 'Adult.' This means that our total for the tickets should have been $120. The concierge had called and made a reservation for us for the 5pm tour. (This is not a regularly scheduled time, but because of it being the holiday weekend, they added it to accommodate the amount of interest.) We had a written reservation card as well that said how many adults, seniors and children were in our party. When we arrived at the check-in, I handed the young guy behind the counter our slip from the concierge. He rudely responded, "What is this? What's this chicken scratch she has on here." My mother and I were so taken aback by his rudeness we ended up not correcting him when he told us our total was $148, the total for 4 ADULTS. He was a jerk. Plain and simple. It's not my fault you're working on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Take out your frustration on someone else. And, you scammed us. Too bad the tickets are non-refundable and I wouldn't want to see that guy ever again. He was so unprofessional. I work in customer service, and I would have lost my job if I spoke to a customer with that tone. So, the tour was nice, but because of the ticket guy (he deserve a real title) was rude, I can't give them more than two stars.
