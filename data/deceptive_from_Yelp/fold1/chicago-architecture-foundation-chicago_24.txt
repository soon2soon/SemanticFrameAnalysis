I think it really depends on how quality a guide you get when taking the CAF tours. My group had an excellent one, but we left at the same time as another group & they seemed very unhappy when they came back. I just wanted to have the experience of one of the infamous tours, and based on a friend's recommendation, I decided to go with a boat tour and was very happy with the decision. I think that next time, I might try going on one of the walking tours, but it all depends on when I get a chance to go again. In the meantime, I learned a LOT about the architecture in the area and I recommend these tours to anyone, local or tourist!
