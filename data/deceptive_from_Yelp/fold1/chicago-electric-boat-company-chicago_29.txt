I recently had the opportunity to go on a boat ride for a friend's 30th birthday party.  I thoroughly enjoyed the evening out with my friends, and was impressed with the staff at Chicago Electric Boat Company.  I drove my car and got validated, but taking the train is a good option to save money. We had some finger food and drank wine while taking in the spectacular city views from the river.  It's a great way to spend time with friends while enjoying the summer weather. Ron Silvia, the president, is helpful, incredibly hilarious and such a joy to be around.  I will definitely be bringing my out of town relatives here.  Such a Chicago gem and worth every penny.
