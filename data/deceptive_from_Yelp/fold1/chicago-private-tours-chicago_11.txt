One word... AMAZING!!! At first we thought it was a little of a splurge, but half way through the four hr. tour both my mom and I thought it was 100% worth it. Mike the owner, accommodated our last minute request. Jim the driver and George the tour guide were extremely knowledgeable, flexible and made it down right fun. Can't recommend it high enough!!
