Very nice hotel. Â Excellent location, easy to find. Parking right next door. Great shopping and restaurants within walking distance. The room service breakfast ("Knock and Drop") was good, but not exceptional. The coffee that they delivered WAS exceptional. Service great, the place clean and quiet. Loved it! The rooms were comfortable, the bed firm, and the city-view impressive. The staff were incredibly helpful. We will stay here again!
