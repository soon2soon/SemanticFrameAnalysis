I bought the Bikes and Bites Tour as a present for my dad as a belated Father's Day gift. The weather was beautiful and we had a blast! My dad and I live in the Chicago suburbs and we love biking, eating, and Chicago history! (so what more could we ask for!?!) We had a great trip, the food was delicious, our tour buddies were fun, and our guide, Pat, was knowledgeable and really made sure that we had a enjoyable, safe ride. At the end of the tour, we all swapped info for various conversations that came up along the trip. We all got along so well and we made some new friends! Â We would definitely go back for this tour or another by Bobby's. Thanks again!
