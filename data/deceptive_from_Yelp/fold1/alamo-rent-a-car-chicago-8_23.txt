The service at checkout is great. I took the car in Chicago O'Hare airport. I was driving the car after a day and I saw the blinking on the dashboard saying need to check the tires. I took the car to the nearest mechanics and have them check, I pay $20.00 to adjust all the tires and the guy told me to drive around and if it blink Â again just return the car. I called the 800# and they told me that they have it till 4 in the afternoon, I waited to call me back but they never did. For short they wont have available car till its time to return the car. Here I am driving the car for whole week with kids riding with me and the blinking in the dashboard still on. I was planning to mention the problem when I return the car but the lady who is not helpful told me that the system is down and they will email me the receipts, so far I still did not see the receipts and I saw the charges in my cc is a big $. Alamo rental car is not a good rental to rent a car.They wont offer the any service when you need them, they want you to resolve your problems. ESB
