My wife signed us up for a tour of Hyde Park, primarily for the novelty of riding Segways.  She had a Groupon, making it quite a good deal.  It was way worth it!  Our two sons got a thrill from riding the machines, while my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the tour of Hyde Park and University of Chicago.  Our guide Vincent was very personable and knowledgeable about the area.  It's reassuring to be guided by someone whom all the locals call out to when he passes by.  The tour part really exceeded our expectations.
