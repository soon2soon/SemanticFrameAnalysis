We hired Aries for transportation for our son's wedding and they were all we asked for and more. Every question I asked was answered promptly and professionally and the price was very reasonable. The driver actually made three runs for us. First the wedding party was taken about town for photos, then the shuttle returned to the hotel to pick up two more groups of relatives and guests to take them to the venue. Everything ran smoothly, despite a street fair that had closed streets in the area. Â The shuttle was clean, the driver was courteous, and the service excellent. I would definitely use Aries again.
