My wife and I bought tickets through Goldstar for the BBQ tour. It was awful. We learned more about the tour guide than the city, and the tour certainly didn't highlight BBQ - or blues - as the name of the name insinuates. We ended up leaving the tour early, it was so horrid. After the tour, my wife asked for a refund. The tour company refused.
