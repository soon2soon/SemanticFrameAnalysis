Fantastic hotel, never mind with these people saying tiny bathrooms and slow elevators. Seriously? You'd rate it better if the elevators were quick?I stayed there for 4 nights and could not find a problem. The lobby has free coffee in the morning and free booze in the early evening. As good as the room is, it's the little extras that make me recommend it. They were really nice about checking me in early and even let me know about how to get more freebies! The front desk and concierge were very helpful with directions, etc.I wish it was in a better neighbourhood. The area is clean and safe, but if you don't go to the theatre, you won't care that it's in the theatre district. Other than that, I would totally stay here again.
