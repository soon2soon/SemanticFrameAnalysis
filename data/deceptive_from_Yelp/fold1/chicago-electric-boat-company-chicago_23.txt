Bought a YouSwoop 2 hour voucher for $99 to try out something different with my family (3 kids 3 and under) and some friends and it was WONDERFUL!  I would say the weather made it a really great trip but the boat was quiet and clean, the office staff was casual but professional, and it was nice to be able to go out on the Chicago River on our own.  I would highly recommend this as a unique, fun activity for all.
