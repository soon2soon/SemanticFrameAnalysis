Our family had a great time on the boat- but as an experienced sailor I have a problem with their vessels. First, as helmsman I was given a MAJOR warning by the company rep that the steering could be easily jammed with a sudden movement of the wheel. Does it make sense to rent boats to the public that have the potential to jam when trying to avoid one of those massive barges converted to a tour boat? I think not... Second, I found the steering to be abysmal- the boat wallowed like a pregnant water buffalo! They apparently use directional thrust to steer, not a rudder. So response is very slow and has significant lag time. Again, avoiding the large tour boats, especially at the busy confluence of the North and South branches, can be rather... exciting. Overall, we all had fun, but you'd better be good at the helm with these boats. And pray that the steering doesn't jam!
