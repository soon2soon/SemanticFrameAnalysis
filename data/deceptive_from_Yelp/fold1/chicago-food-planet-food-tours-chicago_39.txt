I have never done a food tour before, walking or otherwise, so this was a completely new and exciting experience for me! Being someone who isn't a picky eater at all, I enjoyed all of the food a lot and had key places I would go again, especially Piece. Not only did we get to try a ton of tasty food, but I didn't have to feel too bad about it because we were walking and the information we got about the area, the architecture, and the history was extremely informative and highly entertaining. This is an awesome concept, great way to spend an afternoon if the weather allows! I had a blast!
