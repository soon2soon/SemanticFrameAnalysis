This hostel was AMAZING!  I am from Chicago, born and raised, so I know the area pretty well.  This place is located in Lincoln Park, which is a college community, lots of students 18-27.  Its kind of hard to get here at night in the winter as the ground is completely covered in ice, and the hostel itself does take about 5 minutes of walking to get to if you take the train, but its TOTALLY worth it.  The staff is SUPER friendly and extremely helpful.  Even after you check out, they will hold your bags in storage for free, AND let you use all of the facility for FREE.  This place is super clean.  I recommend it.
