I absolutely fell in love with the Chicago Architecture Foundation on my recent visit to the LA area. We went about 4:00 p.m. so it was still light out. We stayed a few hours, to see the sunset and night descend on Chicago. Amazing views in every direction--Holllywood Sign, downtown. Don't miss the James Dean statue! There is so much to see and do! Walk around the whole exterior and then there are tons of interesting displays inside, as well as some planetarium shows.
