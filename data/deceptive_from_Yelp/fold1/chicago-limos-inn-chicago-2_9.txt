Terrible experience.  I would like to give this company a zero-star rating.  My friends and I were looking to book a ride home from a wedding in Rosemont back to the city.  I made the reservation for a 10-passenger limo over a week in advance, and I was confirmed of the reservation by email.  On the night of the wedding, the driver never showed.  I tried calling the company multiple times, but no one answered, even though they advertise 24/7 service.  So I was stranded with nine drunk people.  And a $200 charge on my credit card. The following Monday I called Chicago Limos Inn in the mid-afternoon, and was told they had a glitch in their system over the weekend, and couldn't access their schedule.  I did not really buy that story, especially because the girl knew exactly who I was when I called and said I wanted to complain about a no-show (Were we their only trip that night?  If so, could they not remember a single trip?).  I'm pretty sure our driver just failed to show up to work that night.  She told me the manager was planning to give me a call to explain and see what they could do to amend the situation.   By Wednesday, I still had not heard from the manager at this company.  I placed another phone call, and was told he was not in the office yet (this was about 7:30pm).  On Thursday I called again, and the reservation specialist hung up on me when I asked to speak to the manager about the no-show and charge.  He told me there is nothing they could do.  Obviously I called right back, and was hung up on again. Needless to say, Limos Inn is completely unreliable, and a nightmare to deal with.  This city is filled with plenty of other limousine companies, such as M&M and Viatas.  I suggest you go there.
