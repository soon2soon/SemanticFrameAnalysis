Went on this dining tour with some friends and I'd have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurants were all vibrant and bustling but with our expedited service it really made for a nice night where we didn't have to focus on where to go and what to eat.  Instead we just had fun hopping from place to place, drinking, dining and having a great time.
