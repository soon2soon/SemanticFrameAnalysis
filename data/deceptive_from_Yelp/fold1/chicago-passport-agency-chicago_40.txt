I had scheduled an appointment for 21 march 2012 at 9am i arrived at the federal building at about 8 and i waited in the line till 830 which at this point they started having people go through the metal detectors. I arrived on the 18th floor at about 9am i had all my documents in hand and ready to go not a single thing missing. I show up to the window provide my documents i am then given a number i go sit down i am called up to the window a few minutes later the women goes through my paperwork and everything was good to go the lady told me to come back at 1pm and i came back picked up the passport and i was done. This had to be the easiest thing i have ever had to do. Sorry if all this writing doesnt make sense but i recomend these people they are great and i was pretty much in and out. btw my flight was for another 8 days and they still processed me for same day.
