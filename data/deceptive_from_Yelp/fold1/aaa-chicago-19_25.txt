Was in an auto accident on 7/1/14 around 6pm.  Called for a tow around 8pm.  Told them I had an all-wheel-drive vehicle and would need a flatbed. The truck arrived around 8:30 but was not a flatbed...  No big deal, mistakes happen.  The guy left and said he'd call another truck.  I received a call around 8:45 letting me know they'd be out to tow me at 12:50.  12:50am.  I told them this was unacceptable and to try again.  He called back about 20 minutes later saying he could bump me up to 12:30.  Absurd.  I said try again.  In the meantime I called the office again to talk with a manager and explain my situation.  Spoke to Christy - who was very nice and apologetic - she agreed that this was unacceptable...and then did nothing.  I have been a paying customer for nearly 10 years and I finally call on them for help and receive horrible service.  I clearly was already not having a good day, but waiting with my wrecked car until 12:30 was about the last thing on earth I wanted to do.  I guess my issue is that they accept failure and made no effort to help me.  I asked if they would call another tow company for me and cover it, and they flat out refused and said I can do that if I want.  The tow arrived at 11:30, so not the full 4 hour wait, but I think 3.5 hours from the initial call is a tad unreasonable...  On a happy note, the driver was a very nice and knowledgeable guy, he's just working for a sinking ship.  Avoid triple AAA, opt for the Costco equivalent.  That's what I'll be doing.
