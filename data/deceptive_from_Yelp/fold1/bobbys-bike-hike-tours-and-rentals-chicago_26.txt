Did the three hour Neighborhood tour which is meant for all levels...mostly flat and fun, fun, fun.  Pedaling through the city streets, to various parks, beaches, Lincoln Park Zoo, Old Town, Gold Coast, and so on.  We used a discount coupon which gave us significant savings off the regular price.  The history provided by the tour guide was interesting and definitely not boring.  I think his name was DK.  Looking forward to doing it again!
