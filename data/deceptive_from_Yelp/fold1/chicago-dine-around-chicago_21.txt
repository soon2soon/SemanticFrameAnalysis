My friends and i are from the west coast, and never heard of a dining tour before so we decided to sign up and try something new. Going into it, we had no idea what to expect Â but it was an awesome tour with outstanding food! The tour guide was great, and even pointed out different attractions as we were driving to the different restaurants, and even initiated Karaoke on the bus! I am definitely going to sign up for the tour again when I am in town next!
