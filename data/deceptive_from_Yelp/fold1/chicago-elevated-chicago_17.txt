We took the Pedway Tour this summer and couldn't have been happier -- it was a great way to really get a feel for the city in an organic, non-guidebooky way.  Still, it was totally educational -- and very funny, because Margaret is hilarious.  This is one of those things someone who lives in Chicago can do with out-of-town guests that won't drive them insane with boredom -- just take a different tour every time, and you'll have just as good a time as your houseguests!
