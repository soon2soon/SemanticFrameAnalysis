Honestly, I had an awesome experience with Chicago Electric Boat Company. I bought a Groupon for $100 and that got us a 2 hour boat ride. We took the boat up and around Goose Island and then south on the river for a long time. The river was not busy at all (didn't see any boats going around Goose Island). The only other traffic was the big tour boats, which was a little intimidating, but not terribly so. I wanted to mention, the service here was EXCELLENT, which was surprising considering that the staff was all younger guys. They had to push my rental time back 1/2 hour for some reason and they apologized profusely several times. I have come to appreciate good service and I hate when people aren't willing to offer up an apology because they don't want to admit any fault. Anytime, someone messes up and gives me an apology straight away, I take note. I had a great time with 7 others in the boat. I would go back again.
