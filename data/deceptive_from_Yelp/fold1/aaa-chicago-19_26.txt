my wife's car got stuck in the snow. while trying to free it, the engine died and wouldn't re-start. she called aaa. she was told road service would be there in two hours. after one hour, i looked out and saw the road service man inside the aaa truck. i immediately told my wife who went out to meet the aaa truck. as she approached the truck, it pulled away. she called aaa and reported the situation. she was told someone would be out in three hours. when she asked why the road service man had not come to our front door and notified her he was there; she was told they weren't required to do that. talk about lazy! when aaa returned three hours later, she ran out before he had a chance to leave. i should mention, at this point; her car was parked directly in front of our house. he told her he wanted to sell her a new battery. she asked me and i told her to ask him to have it towed to our mechanic a half mile away. i asked the driver why he thought she needed a new battery. he could not provide me with an answer. i asked him to call for a tow truck to have it towed to my mechanic. he complied and three hours later the tow truck arrived and towed it to my mechanic. our mechanic Â told her there was nothing wrong with the battery and she needed a new ignition coil. thanks aaa for trying to sell us a battery we didn't need and the lousy road service. i certainly wont be renewing my membership.
