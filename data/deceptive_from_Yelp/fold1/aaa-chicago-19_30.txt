In August I called AAA when our car would not start.  The phone staff of AAA were kind and prompt in sending someone to check our battery.  It was a starter problem, so AAA then called another servicer. The towing truck driver that they called was gruff and negative, and even worse tore both CV boots on our car.  (Which was verified by the mechanic who replaced the starter, and later another AAA approved mechanic who assessed the damage.)  The process of documenting the damage started well, but after almost 2 months we were told it was our word versus the tow truck driver, and that we were on our own to negotiate with him directly or simply pay the @$1000. repair bill.  This has been a very expensive and disappointing experience with AAA.
