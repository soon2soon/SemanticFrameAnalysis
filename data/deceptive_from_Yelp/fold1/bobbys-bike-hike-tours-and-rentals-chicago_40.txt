I was looking for something different to do with my daughter and niece when we were visiting Chicago.  And I found Bobby's Bike Tours online.  We did the Lakefront/Neighborhood tour.  We had so much fun going around the city on bikes.  Our tour guide was very knowledgeable on the area and we found it very interesting.  We especially enjoyed the bike through Old Town.  It was hard to believe that this area was in the city, it was so peaceful.  I would certainly recommend taking a bike tour if you are looking for something fun to do while visiting Chicago.
