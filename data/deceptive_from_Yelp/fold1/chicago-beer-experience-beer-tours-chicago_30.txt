I went on the Lincoln Park tour on April 7 and tour guide Jen did a great job. She is very knowledgeable and shared her knowledge in a way that was informative and fun.We tasted plenty of fine beer and I even purchased several to take home when we stopped at a Â beer, wine and spriits store.I would recommend this tour to any beer lover.
