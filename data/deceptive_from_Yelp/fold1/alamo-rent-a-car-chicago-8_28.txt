Everything went well up until we returned the vehicle. Returning the car was so confusing because there were about 10 signs saying car return and no one to direct you upon entering where exactly to go. So driving a little confused through the parking lot, I turned around and asked a lady where I should go to return the car - she replied with didnt you hear me honking at you and you just need to follow the signs. I replied with I was confused with all the return car signs which she then replied with "mmmm hmmmm." I was in no mood to get into it with her so I asked her where do I need to go so next time there wont be so much confusion - she replied with just follow the signs! Rude and unprofessional is all I can say about this employee. I have never experienced treatment like this at any other car rental company and I am a very pleasant individual so for me to be complaining means something is wrong with the way I was treated.
