We only had 24 hours in Chicago. We took the early tour around the neighbourhood and enjoyed it very much. Eddy was fantastic and Â we saw a lot of the City . With all the information we received, we spend the afternoon exploring Chicago on our own. Everybody can do it and it is a lot of fun to visit a city by bike. We defintely will do a bike tour withe Bobby's Bike Hike again on our next trip to Chicago
