Had an AWESOME time on the bus. We were in town for my boys bachelor party and decided to do this. The staff was super cool and Kevin the tour guide knew a bunch of good storys about the bars and stuff in town. We were feelin rough after a long night before and showed up like 30 minutes late but they had beers waiting for us when we walked in the door. All the other people on the bus were real cool and everybody had a great time. For sure got our moneys worth of beer and good times, I definitly recommend it Jake
