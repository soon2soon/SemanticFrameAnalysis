Docents always give some great information.  I've done tons of walking tours as a member, and love their Open House Weekend.  I'm very sad I won't be living in Chicago to take more tours.  Highly recommend becoming a member.  If you take more than two tours it pays for itself.  Don't recommend the gift shop though.  Too little to do with architecture.
