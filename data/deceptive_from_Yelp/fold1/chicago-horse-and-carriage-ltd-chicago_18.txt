Rude staff!! Asked for $40 for a 40 minute ride and finished it even before 30 minutes. When I pointed out that there were 10 minutes still left, she denied and was very rude. Very unfriendly Â and unprofessional. Was also not nice to my 5yr old daughter. I just not recommend it to anyone. I really wonder why the manager wouldn't bother to work on it even after getting so many negative reviews. What a face he has to continue providing such a bad service even after everyone is pointing out where things can be improved! Take your business elsewhere. No one needs your crap.
