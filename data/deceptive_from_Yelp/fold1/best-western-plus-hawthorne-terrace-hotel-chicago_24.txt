Some Best Western Plus Hawthorne Terrace Hotel in the US are getting tried but not this one. I have stayed here many times. It is in a great location downtown the rooms are consistently nice and the staff is helpful but not bothersome. I also love the Best Western Plus Hawthorne Terrace Hotel already don check in system so they just grab the paperwork for you and you go. Not sure why other hotels don't do this.
