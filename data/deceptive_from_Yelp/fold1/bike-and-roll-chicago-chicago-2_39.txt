My eight year old and I rented a comfort bike and a tag along at the Millenium Park location. After a beautiful ride up the lakeshore past Lincoln Park, I realized they didn't include a lock. This might seem minor, but we weren't able to stop anywhere and lock up the bike. I complained when we returned, and they graciously didn't charge us for our rental. Accidents happen, but customer service usually doesn't come through like this. Greg was awesome! I will definitely be returning!
