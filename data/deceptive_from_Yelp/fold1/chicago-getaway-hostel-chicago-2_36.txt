This was my first stay at a hostel. I was nervous traveling alone by myself but the Chicago Getaway Hostel did a great job of helping me out. It is in a safe part of Chicago (Lincoln Park) and it is very close to DePaul University (I was here to check out the school for graduate programs and for interviews). It is also close to markets, dining and shopping options. CGH does have a nice kitchen, so you can buy some groceries and cook in some nights to save money. I had a dorm ensuite. It had a private bathroom and I had 3-7 roomates in one night. The bathroom was always kept clean, housekeeping changed the sheets everyday but the towels here are very rough and small, but it was better than nothing and appreciated. Beds were very comfortable and the free wi-fi, outlets and free breakfast were all nice touches. I did not participate in many hostel activities due to me being under 21, but I still made a few friends in my room and during my stay here. Luke, Jason and Mat were all very helpful and very nice towards me and my questions and offered plentiful advice about the museums, shopping, dining, etc. Price was very decent. I spent seven nights, eight days here and spent under $300. Security was also great with the door keys opening your hallway then your room. I felt very safe staying here. They also provide free lockers for your valuables, but bring a lock! If you're under 21, and need a place to stay, I'd recommend this place. If you're on a budget and looking for a great place to stay, same thing. Absolutely positive experience.
