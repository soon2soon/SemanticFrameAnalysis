Friendly service, great bikes, cheaper than Bike and Roll (plus they're competent enough to have locks available for their bikes).  I had a flat during my half day rental, and when I made it back the folks at Bobby's immediately gave me a new bike and extended my rental, rather than make me pay for a tube and/or wait.  Good stuff.
