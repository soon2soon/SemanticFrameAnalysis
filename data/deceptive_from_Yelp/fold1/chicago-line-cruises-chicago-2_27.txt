Very nice cruise, free Starbuck coffee and cookies. Â On the weekends buy your tickets in advance, it might be hard to find purchasing the tickets the day of the cruise, oh suggestion call to purchase the tickets over the phone, you can purchase them online but they charge a fee of $3 per ticket online, but over the phone there is not an additional charge.
