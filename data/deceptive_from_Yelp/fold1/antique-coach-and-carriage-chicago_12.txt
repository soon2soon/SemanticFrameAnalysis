We tried this ... what a horrible experience.  The smell behind a horse is not good.  The driver (Don) was grungy and grumpy.  Cars were constantly honking at us ... think about it .... a walking horse in downtown Chicago blocking traffic on already congested roads .....?  Not really a good idea in the first place.  Overall, not a good experience and will not do it again.
