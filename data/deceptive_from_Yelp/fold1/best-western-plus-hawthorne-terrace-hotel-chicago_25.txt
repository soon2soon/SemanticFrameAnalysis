I stayed there on a business trip. It's an older hotel but well maintained. I had an issue with the air conditioner making a noise. I told the front desk and they had someone come to the room and fix it immediately. The rooms are a little small and the shower head is a little low for an average height person. It was a quiet and clean room in a great location.
