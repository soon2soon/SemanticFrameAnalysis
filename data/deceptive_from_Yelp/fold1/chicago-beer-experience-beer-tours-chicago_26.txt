Set up a tour with a 12-person bachelor party. Didn't know what I was getting, but my expectation was through the roof. Our guide Ariana was as cool as can be- super informative, and really laid back. Definitely knew how to handle a bunch of loud 25 year olds. Way more beer tasting than I expected (not a bad thing). Everyone loved it, and I'll definitely be doing another tour soon.
