I surprised my boyfriend with this beer tour for his birthday. I'm generally a Miller Lite person, but he likes all the funky, microbrew stuff. We both really enjoyed it! Luke was a great guide! He knew a lot of interesting facts about Chicago and beer. The beer and bacon pairings were great-I had no idea there were so many different types of bacon and how well they went with beer! I highly recommend this as a fun afternoon in Chicago!!
