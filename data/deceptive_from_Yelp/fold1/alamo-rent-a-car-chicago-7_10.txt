I rented from Alamo at Midway airport in Chicago.  Because of the air traffic control facility fire, there were many cancelled flights and MANY people changing plans, getting different flights, and having to rent cars.  While the Alamo lines were pretty long, they did a great job of handling the increased traffic.   There was just a slight delay in moving through the rental process.
