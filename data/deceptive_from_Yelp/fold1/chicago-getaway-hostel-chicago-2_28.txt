Perfect hostel: great location, all the facilities you could want and a really modern vibe. I have never stayed in a cleaner hostel. The dorms are spacious, comfy and cleaned every day. You are provided with a towel and blankets and a pillow - all of which are replaced daily. The location is perfect. You're not in the CBD but you wouldnt want to be as it's easy to get there via trains and Lincoln Park is full of the best food and bars. Dont bother staying anywhere else
