My husband and I just finished the Bucktown and Wicker Park Food tour and had an amazing time.  Chrisitna was our tour guide and she did an awesome job!  Her energy and passion for the tour was contagious.  Not ony did we taste great food, but we also toured historical areas located in Wicker Park.  I highly recommend this to, not only to those who are visitng Chicago, but to those who live in Chicago.  I've lived Chicago for ~1.5 years and can't believe I just experienced this today.  From George's Hot Dogs to I Cream, the day was full of fun.  We are looking forwad to taking our next tour!
