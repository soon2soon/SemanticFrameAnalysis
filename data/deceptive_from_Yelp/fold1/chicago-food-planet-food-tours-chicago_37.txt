Chinatown After the Chinatown food tour today, I've now been on all 3 offered by CFP.  They have all been excellent, but I think this one was my favorite!  Our guide Hilary (who was also our guide for the Gold Coast tour) was spot on: extremely knowledgeable, fun and completely accommodating. I'm a native Chicagoan and have been to Chinatown a few times, but have always felt a little lost when I go.  So for me, the best part of the tour was that the regional cuisines of china are explained in detail and you get to sample foods in authentic Canton, Szechuan and Mandarin styles (not to mention tea from a tea shop and a wonderful pastry at the end) so you can really understand the differences and why they're different.  The social importance of meals in the chinese culture was also emphasized as well as the significance of tea.   Because of this, the main difference between this tour and the others is that you sit down with your fellow tour-ees at each stop and basically have a small meal at each place.  For me, the highlight was Lao Sze Chuan  - the food is spicy and absolutely perfect.  If you don't like spicy, try it anyways, you'll thank me later. Definitely come hungry, this tour will fill your brain and your stomach -  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning some history and culture... oh yeah, and eating some delicious things.
