The Bucktown/Wicker Park walking food tour last Oct. 20 Saturday was a treat from my daughter's fianc√©, a great way for me and my daughter from Los Angeles to know a little more about Chicago. It was a perfect day for walking, the sun was surprisingly out and just got cooler on our way back. Sophie, our guide, Chicago-born and raised, was very knowledgeable not just about the foods we tasted, but, the history and the architecture in the area (I think this was the best part of the tour for out-of-owners like us). Now, about the food, we had a taste of the much-raved about Chicago dog from George's hotdog place. IT WAS GOOD! The combination of the warm hotdog, mustard, fresh tomatoes, Kosher pickle and onions was a good starter. Next, we took a short walk to a tiny cafe Mindy's serving hot cocoa with marshmallow, and the vanilla added was just enough to give you that warm satisfied feeling in your stomach. Then, The Goddess and the Grocer was next where we tasted an antipasto salad with goat cheese, unique, refreshing, and tasty. Afterwards, we went to a little park in Bucktown where Sophie gave us 3 varying stories about the origin of the town's name--find out which one you prefer when you join the tour. Then off to Wicker Park where we had thin-crust pizza and beer from The Piece Pizza, falafel sandwich from Sultan's Market, and lastly, That Guy from Florida ice cream from ICream where we saw ice cream made with a flash of liquid nitrogen--awesome! For someone who definitely want to know more about the lifestyle of locals in Chicago and the food they eat, this is one tour you should join. This parallels my enjoyment in cruising the Chicago river and Lake Michigan. Thanks, Sophie, for being a patient, and knowledgeable guide.
