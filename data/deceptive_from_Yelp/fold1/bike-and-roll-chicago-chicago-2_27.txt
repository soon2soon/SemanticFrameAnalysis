I took the segway tour along with my niece. We did the lakefront which was cool, although I was hoping to do the skyscraper (Definitely next summer!) it was a blast even in the rain. Our tour guide "Anthony Z" was excellent. He trained each tour participant until they felt comfy and ready to roll. He also shown a keen awareness and utmost interest in all sights seen and talked about. I would definitely recommend this/all tours that they provide be it bike or segway. I would also look for coupons due to these economic times the tours can get a little expensive but again well worth it. I hope to be a roller for a long time to come. Â GO, SEE, DO IT once spring/summer comes next year 2012!!! KJ-B
