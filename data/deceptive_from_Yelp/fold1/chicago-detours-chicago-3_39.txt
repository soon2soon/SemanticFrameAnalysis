We took the Inside the Loop tour on Friday afternoon and what a treat it was. Amanda, the company's founder, shared many details of the city's art, architecture, history and culture with our small group as we walked through part of the downtown area. It really is amazing the amount of facts and figures that can be shared in a 1/2 mile walk. And who knew that observing rats looking for cheese would influence the infrastructure of the train system?! I am looking forward to our next trip to Chicago so that we may take the Historic Bar Tour! Thanks again for your knowledge and appreciation of the city.
