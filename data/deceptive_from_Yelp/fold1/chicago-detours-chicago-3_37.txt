We were in Chicago for our daughter's wedding. A lot of relatives and friends came from overseas and we wanted to do something with the group during the days after the wedding. Chicago Detours appeared to be an excellent choice. Amanda combined and customized existing programs based on the group's interest and time schedule. Our group of 26 was pretty diverse with four nationalities and ages ranging from 13 to 60+). However, the variety of topics and views, combined with Amanda's stories and knowledgeable background information kept everybody 'on their toes' during the part-walking and part-bus tour. Even the coffee break and the lunch stop fitted right in the program and provided an extra 'touch' of Chicago. We're all looking back at a very enjoyable and informative tour day.
