Wow this company is incredible hosts! We took the brew bus on a group outing to wisconson to wilmot mountain ski resort, and it was one of the best times ever! They came ready with cups coolers and ice, they even had android and I phone chargers, plus a jack so we could play our own music! We never had to ask to stop to use the bathroom or smoke or get booze, the bus driver pulled over everytime it was appropriate and we made it in record time! Thanks chicago brew bus, you guys are the best!
