We had tried to rent from another company but never heard back so called Chicago Limos Inn because of their Yelp rating. We arrived on our plane at O'Hare, picked up our luggage and headed to the area for Sedans & limos. We called the service and they immediately asked if we had gotten our bags first We told them yes and that we were already waiting at the curb. They wanted to know if we were in the right area. Many times we assured them we were in the correct area. 20 minutes later our car finally arrives. The driver called out our name and we headed for the car. He seemed to have trouble keeping the trunk open and had to hit the button a few times. When we got into the car, he checked with us to make sure he had the correct destination, then said NOTHING the remainder of the ride. We did hit traffic, but we always use sedan service when we travel and have never had this type of service. The car was a little worn and needed some cleaning as we could see areas where oil from hands collects. We also were not offered bottles of water, which is normally customary. At arrival at our hotel he finally spoke to ask for our credit card and told us the total which was the agreed upon amount. BUT when he handed us the ticket to sign, he said "you can fill out the amount and then sign the receipt". Excuse me? The total agreed upon already had a tip. Did he think he deserved another one? He unloaded our luggage on the curb (not in front of the hotel, but the restaurant next door) then just got in the car and took off. No thank you or anything. Maybe he was having a bad day? I don't know, but we will not use this service again.  I have been told that "UBER"  is a better service.
