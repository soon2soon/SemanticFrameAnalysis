This location is not accommodating to breastfeeding moms if you're attending a conference.  My company had a multi-day conference so I had to attend from 8 am - 5 pm for 2 days - staying one night. Since check in is not until noon I asked for a place to pump and was told I could use the bathroom.  They wouldn't offer an office of linen closet even. Finally after complaining enough they gave me a smaller room that was open but I had to check-in and stay in that room for the night.  So since they couldn't offer me anything else I was punished with a  sub-par room and not offered any sort of discount or compensation to make up for it.  Not overly friendly staff and not at all helpful with the situation.  I would not recommend booking a conference here if you have any mothers to consider.
