Last year my brother took his kids to a segway tour at navy pier. . it was rushed with very little instruction and my brother was collided by another rider and got thrown.  THIS year we tried the Bike and Roll Chicago  tour on Wabash. It was excellent! the instructor, Justin Adair was personable and SO informative-- he took apart the segway to show how it worked, which gave a better understanding of how to operate it. He did a one-on-one session with everyone to make sure they were comfortable enough before the tour even began. During the tour the tour took stops for photos and bathroom breaks. What a world of different from the previous tour! I very highly recommend it and we will keep coming back!
