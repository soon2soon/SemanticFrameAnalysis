My family visits Chicago from Denver about 2-3 times a year, so we have been on lots of tours.  This past weekend we went on the 2 hour Chicago Film Tour, and it has become one of our favorites!  One of the best features, is there are TVs on the bus, so you can watch the clip of the film as you drive by the location where it was shot.  We drove all over Chicago, and saw a lot of places that I've driven by on many occasions, and didn't know there was any significance to. The guide was funny, energetic, extremely knowledgeable, and interactive with everyone on the bus.     If you're a movie buff, or enjoy learing about some Chicago history that's not well known or publicized, I would highly recommend this tour!
