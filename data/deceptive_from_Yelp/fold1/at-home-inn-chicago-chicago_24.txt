At Home Inn Chicago was great.  A group of friends and I stayed in a until on Eugenie St. for a weekend get away.  The place was pretty, easy to find, close to everything.  The staff was friendly and easy to work with.  They provided everything we needed for an outstanding weekend and as icing on the cake, it was super cheap.  I can say that I will be using them again!
