Thank you so much to Brian, Margo, and Karen for last Friday's tour. My friends and I had an absolutely amazing experience. Although I'm not a skeptic, I went into the experience with a sense of humor because I was focused in having fun and not taking whatever happens too seriously. Little did I know that everything would turn so personal instantly and provide me with such a sense of peace with a past loved one. I need to come by again and bring my mom because she would like to experience the same kind of peace. Thank you so much again.
