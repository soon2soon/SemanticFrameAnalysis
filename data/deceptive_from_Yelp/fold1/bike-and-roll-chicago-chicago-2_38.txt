Me and my husband did a Sunset Segway tour yesterday, Crystal our tour guide was the BEST, she was fun and Bubbly and full of information!! We had such a Great time. I was nervous getting on that thing but she was patient and very informative in 5 minutes I was riding like a pro. The tour wasn't cheesy, (which I was prepared for) she really knew a lot about the city, things I never knew and she's not even from here!! Thank you Crystal for making our tour FUN! You want to have a Fun tour ask for Crystal. Well be back again because of her. You Rock Crystal, Thank you!
