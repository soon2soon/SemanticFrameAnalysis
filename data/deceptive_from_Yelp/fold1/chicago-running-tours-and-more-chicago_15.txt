We had such a nice running tour the other day! It was personable, fun, and informative! I have lived in chicago for the past 9 months, and didnt know alot about Millenium Park. What better way to learn about the park, than to run through it! The run was adjusted to our own pace. The tour guide was awesome! He held our stuff in his backpack, acted as our personal photographer in front of the touristy must-see attractions in the park-- and provided interesting information! I would recommend this run to any tourist, at any age group, and any running level. Definately well worth the price you pay!
