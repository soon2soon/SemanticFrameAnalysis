My teen son and I recently stayed at Chicago Getaway Hostel for nearly two weeks while he attended a summer camp. The hostel was very clean, the facilities - kitchen, common areas, bathrooms, rooms - were clean. The staff was extremely nice, friendly, and helpful. One of their employees has been there for something like five years - always a good sign. The location is very convenient to the el - a five to eight minute walk. The bus is closer. Lincoln Park Zoo is free and very close. Everything is walkable if you are accustomed to walking. Breakfast is satisfactory and generous. There is free Wi-Fi and access to a printer (also free) in case you need to conduct a little business while there. Usually we stay at very nice hotels - at least 4 stars booked at bargain rates. I would stay at Chicago Getaway Hostel again and have already recommended it to others. Also, I've read other reviews comparing the hostel to a college dorm....I'm in my 40's and saw many other guests around my age - some with children. Don't let the comparison to a dorm turn you off - there are certainly more young people and many international travelers - it was never a problem for us. We turned in early and weren't disturbed.
