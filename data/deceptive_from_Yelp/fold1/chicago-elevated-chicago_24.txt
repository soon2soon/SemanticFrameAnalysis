What a great experience. My wife and I visited Chicago for a few days and were lucky enough to have found Chicago Elevated. We both thought this was one of the best parts of our trip, and came away from the tour with a ton of great information to bring home and amaze our friends with- even the ones who used to live in Chicago! Be sure to add this to your to do list.
