Great tour, a lot of fun and very informative.  Plus, you get to drink a lot of beer.  Couple of suggestions for the guys running it: 1.  It seemed a little dis-organized at times.  Maybe give us a schedule so we know what to expect and maybe a summary up front on where and when we should order food and such.  And I'm not even really sure who was in charge since we had five different people involved at different times.   2.  Our tour lasted about 5 hours which felt about 2 hours too long to me.  We were slow to start and the second stop at Rock Bottom lasted way too long.  Plus, the beer at Rock Bottom really isn't very good in my opinion (maybe that's why it felt so long). Overall it's a great idea and we had a blast.  Your two experts who came along with us were very good and really knew what they were talking about.
