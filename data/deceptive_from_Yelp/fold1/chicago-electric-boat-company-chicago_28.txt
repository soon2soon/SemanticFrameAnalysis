Not much to add to the other reviews.  This place was great and very accommodating.  Only thing negative was it was rather hard to find.  We ended up getting to the office about 12 minutes late which counted as part of our two hours.  I completely understand that and it was 100% our fault for not being earlier.  Great time.  Would do it again in a heart beat.
