We just had a wonderful tour with Nancy and she was so fantastic, down to earth and informative it was just a great experience. She showed us so many great sites including Millennium park, Palmer house hotel and the cultural center. She went out of her way to make sure we understood how to utilize the L train system which was new to us. I can't say enough great things about this program and how easy it was to set it up. she even arranged for us to see the Mayor (he happened to be walking down the street) which was fun too.
