We are a family of 6, mother, father, 4 children and wanted to have a tour in Chicago at the beginning of our week of visit, to get a general view of the city and pick up points of interest to be explored in later. CPT offered us a complete experience and we spent the morning with them in a confortable van going around, taking pictures, listening to news and explanations about the history, the architecture and curious facts of Chicago. There have been jokes and songs to delight our tour, drinks and fresh water to quench our thirst on a hot summer day. If we go to Chicago again we'll contact them to organize another tour, maybe outside the town in the nearby!!!
