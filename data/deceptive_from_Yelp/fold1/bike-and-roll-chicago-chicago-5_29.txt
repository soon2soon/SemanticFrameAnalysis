I had so much fun on this tour!!! My tour guide, Devo was great! She made sure everyone was comfortable on the segways before we got going.  Not only was she funny, but she also took us to many cool sights and shared a lot of interesting facts about the city of Chicago. Growing up in the suburbs, I have been to Chicago so many times, but still learned so many new fun facts!!  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to see the city of Chicago from a different perspective. The tour is a little over 2 hours, but so worth it!!  Such a fun summer day! Thanks Devo and Bike and Roll Chicago!
