Our tour last weekend exceeded expectations. The guide gave us an overview of the different types of beer, the brewing process and the history of beer in Chicago (more notable than you'd think). Our guide was fun to be around and really knowable about brews. My main concern was that the cost seemed high for just a few beers (the company's website estimates you drink about 4 beers on the tour). This was not a problem. First, either I can't hold my liquor or that was more that 4 beers - maybe it was b/c the alcohol % was higher than what I'm used to or b/c I drank the ones my fiancee didn't like. Either way, the cost makes sense for the 3 hours enjoying (and learning about) beer with friends. Seems best for a group. I'd recommend taking friends or for a cool start to a bachelor or bachelorette party.
