I stayed at Acme for 4 nights in late May, 2013.  The cute little hotel was quite a surprise.  I loved the decor and how friendly and cozy it felt.  On my 3rd night the automatic lock on our room door refused to open.  I went to the desk and they sent up a man who could not fix it.  I had to wait for one hour in the lobby while someone from another property came in to attempt a repair.  Alas, it was not to be fixed.  They #1 gave my party free coupons for breakfast the next morning and #2 upgraded me to a suite.  The suite was perfect and the breakfast tasty.  I would HIGHLY recommend Acme Hotel to anyone who was looking for a quiet, unassuming little boutique hotel in the loop.  You'll save some $$$ over the big hotels and you'll really enjoy your stay.  Nice workout room and spa in basement.
