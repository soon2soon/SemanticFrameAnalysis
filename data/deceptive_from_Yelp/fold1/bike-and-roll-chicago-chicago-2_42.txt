Did the Segway tour with Bike and Roll, Sunday June 2, 2013.  This was an outstanding way to see the city!  From Millennium Park to Soldier Field and everything in between---including stops for optional snacks. Our tour guide, Pete was knowledgeable, informative and had a lot of interesting facts about the city sites. Don't miss this tour!
