It may be due to its new 2013 construction or "W lite" nature but this hotel is a very functional, affordable (within reason), stylish property. And it sports the beautiful, airy and lively Beatrix by Lettuce Entertain you on its bottom floor. Great coffee bar and the most unbelievable coconut-raspberry glutenfree pastry I have ever had. I'm not celiac but I picked said pastry because it looked great and I'd come back just for that. They also offer Metropolis and/or Intelligentsia! What?! On another occasion I ordered a Markers Manhattan and it was perfection! (A simple yet easy drink to screw up). The hotel. Guestrooms somewhat simplistic, colorful, horizontal-line-centic, smallish, and minimalist in purpose but just what a couple of busy twenty- or thirty-something travelers need. By the way, the shower setup inspires fun times, IMO. The west-facing river north location is superb, the view very urban revival and the public spaces lofty, almost industrial. And yes there is a fire station accross the street and you often hear sirens, but oh shut it!- big city: take the bad with the good! Overall, a welcome and refreshing addition to the Chicago post-2010 hotel building boom. Whitelodging+LEYE+Starwood you pulled it off. -PB Hotel of choice while W Lakeshore finishes remodel but I somehow deleloped a deep liking to this property in only a handful of stays. New fave? P.S. Endorser of responsible, fair, objective reviewing. I don't post bad 1 or 2 star reviews. I take it up in person or don't revisit. Enough negativity out there, and even bad publicity yields relevance. Focus on the positive and explore. Survival of the fittest.
