This tour was a lot of fun! I've lived in Chicago for six years and I learned stuff about the city that I didn't know before. And I learned plenty about BEER that I didn't know before either! I have been on various brewery tours (Sam Adams, Budweiser, etc) and I wasn't sure what this tour would offer that would be different... but the tour provides so much more information beyond just how beer is made. Our guide talked about the history of breweries, especially in how it relates to Chicago, and also did a great job of comparing different kinds of beer from different breweries as we tasted them. I definitely had some beers that I had never tried before, and now have a few new favorites. Our tour guide was friendly and had a great rapport with everyone in the group. I highly recommend this tour as a stand alone activity or as a great way to kick off a fun night out in the city! P.S. Bacon!
