This is such a beautiful way to see Chicago!  The Chicago skyline keeps changing, so I recommend that everyone take this tour at least once every couple of years! The docent provided us with so many architectural details and historical facts.   I've taken Architecture tours with other companies before, but the docent with the Chicago Architecture Foundation far and away surpasses them in knowledge.   Now when I walk around downtown, I will always remember to look upwards.  Absolutely breathtaking!
