Room was $168 plus tax. It was good overall, but beer prices at the main bar could have been a little lower. Staff was nice. One girl gave me a key that didn't fit my room, so I had to deal with that situation. I told them not to charge my credit card, which I used through Expedia. I think Expiedia needs to approve the change cause I still have that charge on my account. Other than that, can't complain.
