I just want to give a big shout out for the Chicago Dine Around Tour.  This was our second time going on the tour. We went last year for our anniversary and decided that w had such a great time that we would go again. We even told our friends to join us.  The food at each restaurant was better than we thought. With the exception of Quartino, the restaurant selections were different and even better than last year. Our host was friendly, patient and interactive.  Loved the Chicago movie trivia contest.  This year the group was smaller but the majority were friends that came out to celebrate our anniversary with us.  The rest of the people were super friendly and we all engaged in various conversations. If you have never had the experience of progressive dining, I highly recommend the Chicago Dine Around Tour. Everyone should experience it. I think this tour will be our anniversary tradition from now on.
