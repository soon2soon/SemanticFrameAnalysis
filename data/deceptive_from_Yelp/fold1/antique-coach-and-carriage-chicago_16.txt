overworked and depressed horses pulling around tourists - how romantic!  Their noses right up against exhuast pipes on crowded, traffic-filled streets, no breaks given temperature or weather conditions.  I see these horses come down my street every day, rain or shine, sleet or snow and I dont think they think it's so romantic.
