Our trip was great with Alamo rental car, they went out of there way to make us feel welcome to Chicago. They got us from airport to the rental lot in no time, I was traveling in a wheelchair due to a recent leg amputation and was totally treated with respect and we even got a car upgrade to make getting around easier. Thank you alamo for having a great staff.
