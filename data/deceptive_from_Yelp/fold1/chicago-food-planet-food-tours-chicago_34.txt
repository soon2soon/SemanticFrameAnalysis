A couple of freinds and I took the North end tour this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Best city walking tour I've done!  We learned a lot, both about food and Chicago.  We loved our guide, Alia.  She made it fun, and kept everyone involved. From the deli where we built our own Reubens, (and given the secret ingredient to theri sauce!), to teas, then spices, then ridiculously good olive oils and balsamic vinegars, then chocolate, pastry and pizza.... not stuffed - but I didn't need dinner before my plane left at 7pm! I'm telling everyone about this tour.  HIGHLY recommend it!
