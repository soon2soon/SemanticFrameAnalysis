I took the tour last weekend and I was impressed.  The pizza was great (with Gino's East being my favorite), the bus was comfortable, the tour guide was informative, and I was stuffed at the end.  Overall I recieved a lot of knowledge about pizza and some informative history about Chicago.  One of my favorite tours I have taken in a long time.
