well i was so upset with the service i received that if i have to write two reviews i will. The owner is a big time smoker who wont mind smoking or having guest smoke pot in the entrance. the building is in disarray, after you get off the first floor where the lobby is you can tell they are still remodeling. The guest services have trouble with english and if you ask them to explain they will snap at you. For the money 1700 monthly you can find a great building with common floors for guests. They offer a whole lot of nothing and no one is there if you get locked out in the morning until eleven.
