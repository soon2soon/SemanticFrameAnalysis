Overall hotel is clean and tidy. Breakfast was good. Metro is close by so transport is also okay. If it was not for Michael at the front desk being a great help, i would rate this hotel 1 star! Roman who also works at the front desk would be the rudest most arrogant person i have ever met in a customer service orientated job. Other staff were also short and rude when questions were asked! Area is okay, but would not walk alone at night.
