We rented the mini-van for the weekend.  Price was very reasonable.  The individual behind the counter was not very personable.  He was more interested in chatting with his coworker than giving me his attention.  Once I got out into the yard to pick out my vehicle, a young lady helped me out and she was very attentive and helpful.  I got into the vehicle and it was very nice but the windshield was extremely dirty and there were a few paper items on the floor.  Not what I expected from Alamo.  In the past when using them, I have had very good experiences.  I hope this was an isolated incident.
