Less than two weeks before our trip to France we learned our passports had to be good for at least 3 months beyond the return date.  My husband's was going to expire within that time.  After our initial panic we were able to call the automated appointment line and make an appointment that coming week.  We arrived an hour early and the line was short so the guard let us in.  The man who helped us was friendly and wanted to know how long it took us to get there.  When we told him 3 hours he seemed concerned about us having to make the drive again and told us we could come back 4 hours later to pick up the new passport.  We were in and out in about 15 minutes.  When we came back 4 hours later, the passport was ready and in our hands within 5 minutes.  The people here really want to help and they have discretion to decide what delivery method best meets your needs, whether it's issuing the passport the same day, having it ready for pick-up the next day or mailing it overnight or two-day.   Everyone we dealt with, from the guards to the people at the various counters, was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and efficient.  The entire experience could not have been better.
