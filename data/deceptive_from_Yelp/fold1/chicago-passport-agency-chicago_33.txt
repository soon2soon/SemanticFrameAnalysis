My dog ate my passport the Saturday before my flight left (four days away). I called the 800 number on the state department website and the soonest I could make an appointment meant I'd miss my flight and vacation. I took a chance and went to Chicago, I left at 3 am to get there when they opened. There was already a lengthy line and I felt doomed. I was so wrong! It was very busy but many of the people there were for the IRS and other services. I had the printed, filled-in forms, proof of travel, my passport pictures, certified copy of my birth certificate and social security card. I literally walked up to the window, told them what happened, they took my paper work and told me to come back to pick it up at 1:00 pm, the same day!!! I was done and ready to travel by 2:00. I couldn't have been more pleased! Security was even nice :) my advice is be as prepared as you can be and have proof you're flying in 24 hours. Good luck!!!
