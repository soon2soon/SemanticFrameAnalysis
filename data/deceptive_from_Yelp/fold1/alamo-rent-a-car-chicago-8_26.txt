I want to warn everyone who considers renting from Alamo at the O'Hare airport that there is a toll racket going on between their company and the Illinois Tollway department.  As is true of most  people renting there, I am from out of town and did not realize I had to bring a bucket full of coins to cover all the unmanned toll booths in the Chicago area.  The first one I came to, I had to drive through because I didn't have the exact change on me (I only had bills in my purse).  As soon as I reached my destination, I went online and paid the toll.  (I called the Illinois Toll department today and they confirmed to me that I paid!) That was September 1st.  Today (October 23rd) I received notification from Alamo that I did not pay the toll and that they are adding a $15 fee  to the amount (for "processing") and if I don't contact them within 15 days of the letter (sent out October 15th) my credit card will be charged.  When I called  the number provided on the notice, I reached an answering machine with a message that they will call back within 3 business days. Should I trust that they will get back to me and get this resolved before the 15 day grace period?  I am skeptical! Long story short...take plenty of change when traveling to Chicago and don't expect much from Alamo's customer service.  I won't be renting from them again...
