Great hotel for the money!  Our room was clean, all electronics and fixtures worked as they should have, and the king size bed was very, very comfortable.  Upon reserving the room, we made a special request for a room with a good city view, and the hotel was able to oblige.  The building is a little bit older, so the floors creaked a bit, but that did not affect our stay one bit. We were quite satisfied with this hotel, and especially happy that we did not have to pay the $40-$60 for parking that seemed to be the norm at all of the other hotels we looked at in the downtown Chicago area. The only downside we experienced during our stay was the quality of the food that was offered by room service/their restaurant.  Skip it, and walk to any one of the dozens of restaurants in the area. We would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't insist on a flashy, fancy, brand-new luxury hotel.
