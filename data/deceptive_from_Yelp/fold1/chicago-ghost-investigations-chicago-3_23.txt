I'm what you would call an all around skeptic. A friend suggested we go and experience some ghost hunting. I thought, sure why not. The location wasn't in a shady part of Chicago. There are far worst places. Although, I would say it was dark and did have a good creepy factor. It's a loft building, lots of artists going in and out and walking the floors that we were on. I can honestly say, I'm a believer. We were all taught how to Â make contact and speak with the sprit(s). The guide wasn't taking the lead, but instead "guiding" us, letting us have free range of the conversation. For me, it was different, wierd and beyond belief. However, I would go back just to see if I can speak with the same spirit. Highly recommend anyone to experience it for themselves.
