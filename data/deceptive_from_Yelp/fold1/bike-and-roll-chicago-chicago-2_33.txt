My husband and I (we both grew up in Chicago and are 77 years young) did a Sunset Segway Tour with Bike and Roll Chicago last night.  It was awesome!!  Roberta was our guide, assisted by Joe, and they were both great.  Roberta was everything a guide should be - caring and thoughtful as well as knowledgeable about the city of Chicago and It's history.  The segways were fun, the weather was wonderful and the city was beautiful.  We can't wait to do this again.  Joyce B.
