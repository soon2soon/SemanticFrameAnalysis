Beware!  Don't use any 3rd party booking site (like priceline) to book here.  Will treat you like 2nd class customer.  Wouldn't help us because we didn't pay full price.  They told me that I could pay full price and then get some help.  Even asked for a roll out and was told that they don't have enough for the whole hotel and would have to wait till I got there.  Never, never, in my 12 years of coming up to Chicago have I been treated like this.
