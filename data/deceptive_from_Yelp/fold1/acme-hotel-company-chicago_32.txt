I stayed at this hotel with my husband back in March. I have nothing but great things to say about this place. The location was perfect so close to everything. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were cute, artsy and CLEAN! I will definitely be staying at this hotel next time we come back to Chicago.
