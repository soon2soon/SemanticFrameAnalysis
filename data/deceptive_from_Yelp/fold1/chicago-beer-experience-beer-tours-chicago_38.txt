I live in the city and I went on this tour with friends, which was awesome - great way to kick-start the evening!  Next time my parents are in town visiting, I know what to do with them before dinner (we've done millenium park, museums, and all the other usual suspects).   It was a great way to sample some really good beers (we tried some Goose Island, Three Floyds, Great Lakes, and lots more).  The tour guide made it comfortable for beer novices and beer afficianados alike.  He had great Chicago brewing history to share on the tour and made it fun and funny. Biggest pleasant suprise - the beer and bacon pairing at one of the stops on the tour.  Crazy Irish bacon, whiskey bacon, hickory bacon - each paired with a beer to compliment it - awesome.
