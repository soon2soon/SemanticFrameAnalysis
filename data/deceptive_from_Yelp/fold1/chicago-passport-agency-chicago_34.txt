This place was awesome. I wish every government agency worked like they did. I realized I needed a passport about 4 days before I was due to leave the country. I called and there were no appointments available before I was due to leave. I freaked out but headed over there anyways. There is NO NEED for an appointment. Give yourself a lot of time. I got there at about 9:00 and waited in line for about 25 minutes just to go through security and get to the elevators. From there I waited another 25 minutes in line at the passport office. This is a government building people. Don't bring food or drinks, don't use your cellphone and leave your iPad in the car. Have everything (including copies of everything you have, and additional IDs if you don't have an Illinois license) ready when you get to the window. The lady I spoke to was curt but reasonable. I had absolutely everything I needed, including copies. Though I didn't have an appointment (and told her that when she asked) I was the second person called to go up to the window where you submit all your stuff. I don't know why this happened but she seemed relieved that I had all of my stuff totally ready, so that might have helped. The man who helped me (I think it was Carlton) was SO NICE. We actually had a good conversation. My credit card wasn't working and he told me about an ATM on the second floor that I never would have found otherwise. I submitted everything and my passport was ready the next day. If you wait until the last minute to get your passport, I think you deserve to put up with some crap. But this, this was wonderfully easy, except for the waiting in line part.
