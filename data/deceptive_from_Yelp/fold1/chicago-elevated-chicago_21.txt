We went on the Red light tour Â and really enjoyed it. We live in the Chicago area and learned lots of things we knew nothing about. What history lesson! Can't wait for the Riverwalk tour in the fall. We are planning on somewhere between 10 and 20 people and dogs. A bit challenging but I am certain we will again have a wonderful time. We also really want to do the pedway tour in the near future.
