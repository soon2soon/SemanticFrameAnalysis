My wife and I are new to the city of Chicago and this tour was exactly what we needed.  Its a view from a locals perspective.  We we're led on a journey of mythic proportions by Amanda who is both the owner of the company and a Chicago lore master.  The tour we went on focused on the bars of Chicago, there was drinking involved which was nice.  At one rather poignant moment someone at a bar we were visiting asked "are you tourists or something?" and a member of the tour looked at him with and with a beautiful sincerity and simply said "no".  That's because the people on this tour were not tourists but rather curious denizens.  I thought tours could not be "cool" I was wrong.  Will we go on another Chicago Detour? The answer is a resounding yes.  Chicago Detours is a masterstroke.
