Awesome tour of chicago breweries. Kevin is great and will literally give you his shirt off his back to help you out and set things up. Beer is always good but craft beer is even better on this tour. Highly encourage all to try the brew bus. I recommend the 315 pm tour and dont forget to bring drinks for the ride because you can drink on the bus. The bus is also rentable at a very cheap rate compared to most party buses. I recommend also trying the riot sandwich when the tour stops at haymarket, very good. But on the tour only your beer and tour are included no food so be sure to pay your tab. Â Great business.
