Honestly, couldn't have had a better time than we did with our Tour Guide, Brittany.  I wasn't too sure about jumping on a Segway, but my boyfriend really wanted to go, so I bought him their kind of "tour and a bag lunch" thing as a surprise one weekend.  Even with the massive amounts of tourists, we had the BEST time learning about our own city!  I think it's very worth it to staycation sometimes.  Great Job guys!  Will recommend to all visiting friends who want a different kind of tour!
