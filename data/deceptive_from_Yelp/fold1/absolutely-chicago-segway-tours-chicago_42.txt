So fun!  My dad and I loved our segway tour! I must say...when we got to the location of Absolutely Chicago Segway, I was a little turned off by the craziness of the tour guides.  They were trying to be funny and lively and it was kind of over the top. BUT, once the tour began, their excitement, humor, and knowledge of Chicago was the best part of the trip...and to top it off, we got to enjoy it on a segway! Our tour guides were TJ and Parke.  They did an OUTSTANDING job!  Parke is VERY knowledgeable of all the architecture and history of the city.  It was quite amazing!  TJ kept the tour upbeat.  Parke and TJ always had something funny or interesting to say, whether it was about the Soldier Field, the Chicago skyline, or the impatience of a Chicago driver while 10-15 segways crossed the road.
