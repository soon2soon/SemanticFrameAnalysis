Very unique and informative way to explore less touristy establishments in Chicago. Included interesting tidbits about Chicago, history, beer, and all combined. Guides were wonderful, very personable, and full of interest for the subject. Beer (and bacon) was also delicious, satisfying a range of tastes.
