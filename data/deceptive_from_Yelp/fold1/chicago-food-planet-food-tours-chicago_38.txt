Near North Tour I loved the food tour!  The restaurants and specialty shops where we stopped were well-chosen, exactly what i was anticipating.  I thoroughly enjoyed tasting delicious, authentic food, learning about it from experts, and discovering new quality ingredients and products to add to my own cooking repertoire.  Our guide was friendly, energetic, and did a great job.
