I am so glad that I was able to start the first day of my family  reunion on the Spirit Of Chicago Luncheon Cruise.  My family and myself were so impressed with our Tour at Navy Pier That there is talk already of doing it again. The food and the entertainment were outstanding . We enjoyed all the wonderful sights of the city from the windows as we cruised. I want to thank Tiffany Weinstein for all her help in setting this up for us and working with us at every turn to make sure that we had a wonderful time on Entertainment Cruises. We look forward to doing this again with family members the next time we are in Chicago visiting. I couldn't have asked for more at a very good price. Thanks Tiffany Weinstein and Entertainment Cruises.
