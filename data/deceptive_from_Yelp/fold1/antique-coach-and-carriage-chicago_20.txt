My wife and I had last taken a carriage ride in Montreal about 3 years ago and thought we would try again.  Whether Montreal or Chicago, the experience is fun and romantic.  The drivers have to be animated and have a good yarn.  Both the French Canadian and the guy Don in Chicago met that criteria.  It's more fun when you learn little tidbits about the areas you cover.  I read here how some people criticize the horses, I am astonished that they would dislike animals and take these rides.  There is no accounting for taste.  If you like to see a city from a different view, try a horse carriage and find a driver who will be edgy and entertaining.  It's worth the money.
