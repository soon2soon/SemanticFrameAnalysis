Our first outing with the team ended up being the last event held at the Red Lion pub on Lincoln. The three of us had paranormal interests, but still had that inkling of doubt because we'd never experienced much firsthand. I can cut to the chase and say that we all left without the doubt. It was a great experience, and Brian and the rest of the CGI crew is friendly, professional, and made this well worth it. We all want (and need) to do it again, and I'm always telling people that express an interest that CGI is the way to go.
