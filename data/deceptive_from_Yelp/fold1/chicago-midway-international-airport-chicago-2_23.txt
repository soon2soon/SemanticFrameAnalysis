I can't express how much I LOVE this airport. It's my new favorite place to fly in an out of since I had a living hell experience at O'Hare this summer. First, I like the idea of outside check-ins if you are checking a bag. I also like that the elevators on the Southwest side doesn't smell like piss and shit. Secondly, this airport has great signage for bathrooms and shops. Thirdly, the carousel people may be a little slow, but that just means that they are working extra hard to ensure proper service to make sure you get your bag. If your not ok with that, please take my advice and go to O'Hell where you'll spend hours upon hours waiting in line at theticket counter and another 3 hours waiting on one line with ONE tsa agent working the lines. Yep, I felt extremely safe that day, NOT. And the last thing I LOVE about Midway is the security lines. There are 3 different lines to choose from, Experienced, Not Experienced, and Family lines. Makes things quicker.
