My wife and I did the city skyscraper segway tour and it was worth every penny and every minute. Â We kind of lucked out though because we were the only two...probably because it's already October and we did the evening tour. It got chilly! But it was nice to see the city in both daylight and after the sun set (the tour goes from 6p-8:30p). Chicago is so beautiful at night. Our tour guide (Vincent) was really great and knowledgable and the route we took was awesome. Would definitely recommend this! (Oh, and learning to ride the segway takes a few minutes at the beginning but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun!)
