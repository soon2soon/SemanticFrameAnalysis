I rented the Chicago Brew Bus for a Bachelorette party.  I needed transportation for 11 girls, at an affordable price, and for us to be able to stand inside & do "Dares", but  I couldn't afford a party bus.  Thank goodness I found the Chicago Brew Bus!!! They were VERY accommodating & affordable! Kevin, the owner, even let me check out their bus before I committed to renting it out. He even followed up on me the next day & inquired how our night turned out. Jonathan, the driver, picked us up early & even put up bachelorette-themed decor! He was the perfect gentleman--- very patient, fun, friendly, and on-point with whatever activities that my party was doing.  He even had suggestions for perfect photo ops in downtown. He was the driver, DJ, tour guide, all around awesome guy!   I highly recommend the Chicago Brew Bus for any event--- whether or not you're just renting out their bus or going for their tour. With much gratitude to Kevin & Jonathan for their great service, Mae
