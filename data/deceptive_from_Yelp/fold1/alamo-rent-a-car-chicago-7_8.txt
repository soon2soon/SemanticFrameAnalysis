I have always rented from Alamo but my last experience was not a good one. I reserved a car for Thanksgiving weekend, at least 5 weeks prior to my arrival.  When I got to the counter I was told that they did not have ANY cars - there were cars "on the way" but they had no idea how long it would take or how many cars were coming (how they could not know how many cars were coming is beyond me). When I got to the counter there were already 10 people waiting for cars. Of course, it being Thanksgiving, everyone was anxious to get on there way and a estimated 20-30 min wait ended up being 90 minutes. I ended up missing my family dinner because I didn't get out of the airport until after 5pm. Super disappointed with the fact that the manager did not once show up and explain what was going on or why they were short so many carsm, he left it to the poor guys at the counter to take the brunt of the aggravation from customers.  When I left there was a line of people still waiting - not a very good way to start out a holiday weekend.  Not sure that I will rent from Alamo again, which is disappointing because I have always had good experience from them. Just a note - all of the other car rental places DID have cars, so this was not something that is common, apparently Alamo just really overbooked for the weekend.
