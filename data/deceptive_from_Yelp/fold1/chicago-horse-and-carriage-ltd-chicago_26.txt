I was in Chicago last year and I was able to find time to ride the horse and carriage around Navy Pier.  What can I say, but wow!  Definitely had a great time and I am looking forward to heading back to Chicago to ride the carriage again.  Very classy and I would recommend riding with Chicago Horse & Carriage the next time you're in Chicago!
