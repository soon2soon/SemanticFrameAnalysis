W estayed in Old Town in North Suite 2 for Labor Day weekend. The suite was nice a little small though. We loved the neigborhood, it had such a homey feel. I liked the community grill. We were able to barbecue on Monday which was a nice way toi end our trip. The other guests were very nice. Only issue was that we were below another suite and it was really loud. You could hear loud stumping early in th emorning and late at night which made it very hard to get sleep. Sunday night and Monday it was better. I would definitely request to be on the top suite at my next stay.
