Alamo Consistently offers excellent service At a very reasonable price. As long as you reserve online check-in is a breeze and takes no time at all. Returning the car could not be simpler as agents will complete your transaction and get your receipt and in seconds. The buses to take you to the airport terminal are right there. I experience with Alamo is better than with Hertz or Avis. I typically use Priceline to get the best deal possible and I have been highly satisfied. The advantage with Alamo is it is not necessary to pay in advance as with other Priceline participant companies meaning that if you cancel your reservations there is no fee. I highly recommend Alamo
