I had a terrible experience with this company on my wedding day.  When I first called and asked about the price (after having given ALL of the details about time, number of passengers, etc) the receptionist told me the price would be $135.  In the time it took me to get out my credit card, she said it was $155 and that I had misunderstood her the first time around.  I didn't argue because I was already so stressed out about all the other wedding details I needed to take care of the same day. The day of the wedding, the driver was incredibly rude and uncourteous.  When we reached our destination (the church) we were a few minutes early and I asked if we could sit in the limo for a short while so that the guests wouldn't see me.  He told me that this was not in the contract and that he had other places to be.  So we swung around to the back parking lot of the church so that I could enter the church through the alley, essentially (lovely, I know).  This maneuver took about 2 additional minutes and when we got out, he said "That will be $189."  Mind you, this did not include tip. I'm not a petty person.  I will not call them to argue about this just to get some pocket-change back.  But I just wanted to warn others about this company.  The other reviewer seems to have gotten a wonderful experience, but I wouldn't want someone else to take that gamble on their special day.
