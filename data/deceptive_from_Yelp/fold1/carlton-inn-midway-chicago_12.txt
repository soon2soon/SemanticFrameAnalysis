The staff were very friendly from the cleaners to the desk staff. We asked for advice on transport to and from 2 sporting events and got spot on advice. We had a front room and it was a little bit noisy but to be expected on a busy street. We were disappointed with the cleaners talking loudly outside of room before 9am. We feel very safe here. 2 minutes from red bus and loss of places to eat close.
