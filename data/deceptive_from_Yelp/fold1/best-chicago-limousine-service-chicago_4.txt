We contracted Best Chicago Limousine for our July wedding and had a great experience.  Our driver, Luciano, was extremely helpful and courteous.  He politely assisted me out of the limo at each picture stop - which was much appreciated in my cumbersome wedding dress.  He was on time, the limo was clean, and he knew the city well.  Great job!
