Needed a passport soon, but not same day, for work travel.  Tried to use the expedited service offered by the State Department.  After waiting nearly 2 hours, I learned that the clerk nor his supervisor understood the definition of "within.". Told me I'd have to wait days for my passport.  Took the same paperwork to passport agency and had my passport the next day.  Will never deal with the State Department and its uneducated, power hungry, ill-informed clerks (not all are this way) again.  What a waste.
