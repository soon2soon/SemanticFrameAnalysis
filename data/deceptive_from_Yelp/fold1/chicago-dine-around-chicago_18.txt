This will be the third time doing the progressive dinner.  Great time!  Good food!  Will plan on doing it again in the future. First restaurant, included wine, pizza and salad for appetizer. Second restaurant was considered a french restaurant which included chicken, potatoes and non alcoholic beverage. Final restaurant was a Latin restaurant for desserts and coffee. The desserts at the restaurant were very rich, and honestly, not that great. However, this is a very good time. You meet new people and learn about some of the history of Chicago.
