It was an absolutely amazing experience!!!! I wouldn't change a thing, besides the fact that it rained a little. Our tour guide was the most genuine, nice, caring, and funny person around :) I highly recommend Dustin as a tour guide for you to choose :) He was very helpful and encouraging with the passengers and myself..... He helped my mom and I and he made me feel comfortable and very safe :) If you decide to go to "Absolutely Chicago Segway Tours", don't make the mistake of not choosing Dustin as your tour guide. He made it extremely fun and exciting :) Thank you Dustin and everyone at Absolutely Chicago Segway Tours...... Samantha Lambro
