Unbelievably good  Best service I have had for either Private or Public service. But make sure you have all your paperwork ready so they can process it (help them to help you). I arrived at 6:30 AM for the early spot in line, but the Agency was able to help those that came as late at 10 AM (but don't count on coming late and getting done on the same day). Make your reservation through the federal 800 number so you have a confirmation number to get in (although I did not have to wait until my appointment time) I had my passport by 2 PM (same day) and was able to make my 6:45 PM flight out of OHare. Also note that there is tight security to get into the building (think Airport security).  So make sure to leave your bottle openers, nail clippers, water bottles, etc at home.
