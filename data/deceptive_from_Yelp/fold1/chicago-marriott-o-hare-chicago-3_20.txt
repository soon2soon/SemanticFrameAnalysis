I stayed at the Marriott O'Hare in Chicago from Tuesday until today and I have to say it was not wonderful.  Checking in was the worst.  When I made my reservation I was told I would be on the concierge floor and my points would be used for two days of my stay.  I check in and am told they have no record of what the person told me.  They ask me if I have anything in writing.  I remind them I made the reservation by phone.  They make me feel like I am lying, which I was not.  The front desk manager didn't do anything to help me, he just repeated what the other person had said.  My friend asks isn't their anything he can do to help with the situation.  He says we don't negotiate room rates.  I say we're not negotiating we only want what was promised.  They did let me use the points for the two nights and then charged me the full rate for parking my car when the group rate was half.  The next day I bump into a manager and tell him what happened.  He says he will look into it and I will be called.  Right.  Never heard another word.  Real nice hospitality.  I eat lunch in their restaurant.  They had a buffet.  Coming back to the table I see the bus boy looking in the bag I had left on the table!!  I mention it to the hostess and am told he was just checking to see if I left it behind and wanted to return it to me.  NOT.  He saw me and said sorry to me when I got to the table.
