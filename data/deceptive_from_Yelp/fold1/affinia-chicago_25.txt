I've booked here twice, the last time through getaroom.com for a spring getaway. I especially enjoyed the last stay because I got to go to C-House, the on-site restaurant, which serves up some mean steaks. Great location on Magnificent Mile near a slew of shops and restaurants. The staff couldn't be more helpful, and my room was awfully comfortable. This hotel gets two thumbs up -- the only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the hotel charges for internet access.
