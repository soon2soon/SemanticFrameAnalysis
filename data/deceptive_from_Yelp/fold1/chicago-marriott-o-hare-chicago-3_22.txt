What sets this Marriott apart is the staff- at least for me. They aren't just nice, they always seem to be extra nice. And typically speaking if I am at the Marriott at Chicago O' Hare, that means United Airlines found a way to delay/cancel/ruin my flight somehow, and now I'm stuck in Chicago for the night. Somehow, the Marriott folks find a way not to piss me off anymore. That may seem like a trivial accomplishment, but trust me, it's not! One stay they even gave me a substantial amount of Marriott Rewards Points when I checked in to make up for United canceling my flight! And despite usually booking things way late notice (thanks again, United- you bastards), they usually get me a good room and sometimes a pretty nice upgrade. It would be nice if it wasn't a 10-15 minute bus-ride away from O'Hare, but oh well. This is my go-to hotel when United jacks up my travel plans.
