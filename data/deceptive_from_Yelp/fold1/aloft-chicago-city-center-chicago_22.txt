The hotel is trendy/ contemporary style with a young vibe, which we enjoyed. We got a room on the corner and it was bright and spacious, very clean and well-maintained, with a decent view of the city. There was a little bit of noise from the traffic (6th floor) but nothing unbearable. Although the hotel seems to be popular with young people, we haven't experienced any bothering parties or loud noises, but we also stayed there for three nights in the middle of the week. Weekends might be a little different. The staff was nice and courteous. $20 credit for breakfast everyday, but the food was just...meh. It is conveniently located close to many dinning places and bars. This was a business trip and the hotel was booked by the company but we would definitely consider this place next time when we're in town for visiting.
