My boyfriend out tickets for this for my birthday... and I'm sure glad he did! I had an absolute blast! Kevin was out tour guide and we went to Goose Island, Haymarket, and Moon Shine Brew Pubs for some beer tasting. Kevin was really funny and chill yet so knowledgable about the Craft Beer Industry! My boyfriend and him got along great and he was a pleasure to be around! All three places were cool to go to and experience first hand. I had a great time and have already recommended this beer tour to my family and friends!
