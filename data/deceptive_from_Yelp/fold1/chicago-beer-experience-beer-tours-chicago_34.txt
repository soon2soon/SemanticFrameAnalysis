This was a really fun way to spend the day with friends. Hanging out, learning about beer and drinking plenty of it, and getting a taste of some local bars. We went for a friend's birthday, and it was the perfect way to spend the day before going out at night. If you love beer and Chicago, you'll learn quite a bit about both as you enjoy the tour.
