I used a 10 passenger limo from Chase for a bachelorette party I hosted in the city. I was worried at first because they felt a tiny bit unorganized when I was booking them, but I went with it since they were the cheapest I could find. I shouldn't have worried because they were amazing! They were 10 minutes early, the driver was so sweet, the limo was brand new and beautiful, and the driver took us to awesome lookout spots I didn't even know existed! Did I mention it was a great price? I would use Chase Limos again in a heartbeat.
