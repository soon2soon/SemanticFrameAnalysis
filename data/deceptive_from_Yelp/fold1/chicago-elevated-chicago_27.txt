I just took two tours with Margaret last week (yes, she was that good I signed up for two!).  I did the Pedway (which was cool and a totally random thing to do esp if you are new to Chicago - but if you love cities and urban development stuff, you will enjoy the Pedway tour).  I also did the Red Light District Tour - which was less walking, but just as colorful and, perhaps, a little sordid (it's a red light tour!) which was what I was hoping for.  Margaret is enthusiastic about Chicago and it's contagious (in a good way!).  I'm so glad I tried these tours out -- very affordable and very enjoyable ways to get to know Chicago better.   Just do it!!
