I purchased a 45min ride for 12/2011 @ $60 (actual date unknown).  Anyway, due to the Chicago frigged winter weather I was unable to use my voucher at that time. I just used it on Memorial Day 5/28/2012.   Due to the original purchase date, they weren't gonna honor it (driver questioned it) they radioed into Stacey who I had communicated w/ originally she informed me that there is a time frame.Unfortunately, I cannot tell you what the time frame for voucher use is, and I have looked up and down for the  info on their WEB page and I still do not see it.     Nevertheless, they were very gracious and honored partial ride on them (so to speak) I paid for a 45min ride (originally) but received a 30min ride.    I thank them for their cooperation, it was a beautiful night with a great person, and something that neither one of us had done before, a night for us to remember, and I would go again in a heart beat.  Cece the driver, and Milo the horse were awesome and I highly  recommend this romantic adventure with this particular company.   Just in case of bad weather (heat, tornado, typhoon, hurricane, snow storm etc... Find out the voucher policy... lol A very satisfied customer, Tracy~
