A group of 6 of us were visiting Chicago from Toronto to see a few baseball games. Bruce was great in working with us to accommodate our already busy schedule. We booked a private tour on Monday afternoon for the Lincoln Park/Lakeside Tour. Even though we were a little bit late, Bruce was friendly, funny, approachable, and most of all knowledgeable about everything he spoke of. He really impressed us at every location we went to. Our highlight was the bacon and beer at the second bar (unfortunately the name escapes me) and because we were on a private tour we had some extra time to chat with Bruce about Chicago's beer history. This tour was definitely one of the highlights of our visit to Chicago. I strongly recommend trying the Chicago Beer Experience! Thanks Bruce! Sincerely, Chris, Sean, Dave, Luke, Berend and Kyle from Toronto. GO JAYS!
