What a day!  We took the blue line from the burbs, got off at Clark & Lake and it was a short walk to our afternoon of fun!  Pete was our tour guide.  He gave each of us a lesson on riding and safety.  It was easy to catch on before heading out.  The path along the river was amazing.  Our stops were informative and the views awesome! Pete knew his stuff. So much fun, I can't wait to do it again.  It's the best way to see Chicago and it's hidden gems.  WooHoo!!!
