No wifi?! Seriously???? How can this be one of largest, business commuter airports in the country, and yet I can't get a wifi connection to save my life?! It's especially inconvenient since my flight is delayed and I have hours of work sitting in my lap that I can't touch because I can't get on-line. My iPad is also about to die, and there are no outlets in sight, so I can't even use it! Get with the times Midway!
