Rachel gave us an excellent tour and totally impressed us with her knowledge of the food, tea, spices and all we encountered. The neighborhood history offered so much that even as locals we learned things about the city we never knew.  This was my second Food Planet Tour and  can't wait to do another!  My invited friends agree and we'll all be spreading the word.
