We recently spent a weekend at Best Western Plus Hawthorne Terrace Hotel. Our room was beautiful. This is truly a landmark hotel. On Sunday morning we had the best breakfast in a long time in the hotel's restaurant. The lox were unbelievable. So good, in fact, that I want to go back for that reason only.
