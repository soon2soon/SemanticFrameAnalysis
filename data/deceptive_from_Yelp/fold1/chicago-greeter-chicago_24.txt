One of the best free things in Chicago is InstaGreeter!   I signed up at the Chicago Cultoral Center for the 2:30 tour, grabbed a quick lunch at the Subway just up the street, and joined eight other visitors for a great, two-hour walk through the many historic buildings in the Loop area.   Pat Martino was our Greeter and did a superb job of showing us so many things we would have never found on our own.  She started us off with a quick but excellent tour of the Chicago Cultural Center, with its beautiful Tiffany dome than we were off to see so many buildings like Marshall Field's, The Rookery, Chicago Board of Trade building, State Govt. Building, Block 37.and many more.  Thank you, Chicago Greeter!!!
