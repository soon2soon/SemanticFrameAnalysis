Stayed there for a couple of nights last week and would definitely recommend this place!! Staff is super friendly, everything is very clean and there's free breakfast and wi-fi. The location is nice too: it's not exactly downtown (though it's only a couple of metro stops away), but it does have a great many caf√©s and restaurants nearby. When it comes to hostels, this is about as good as it gets!
