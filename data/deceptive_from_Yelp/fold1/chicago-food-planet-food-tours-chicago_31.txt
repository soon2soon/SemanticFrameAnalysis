My boyfriend and I took the Bucktown & Wicker Park Food Tour with Heather last weekend and HIGHLY recommend it.  The tour was extremely well run from start to finish and we got to see some great little spots in a cool neighborhood that we might not have otherwise explored. Heather was super friendly and well-spoken about the area.  She gave us some great tips if we return to Chicago, including a $3 falafel which was awesome!  I loved her background commentary on some of the local chefs and owners of the establishments we visited. You will be 110% full by the end of this tour, but the ice cream finish is well worth the extra pound.
