A great experience!  The segways were super fun and easy to ride.  Our guide, Scott, was very knowledgeable about the city and very patient as we all learned to maneuver the segways.  Even as a native Chicagoan, I learned a few new things on the tour.  Our trip was planned at the last minute, and we hadn't brought a camera.  Scott was nice enough to take some pictures of us and e-mail them later in the day.
