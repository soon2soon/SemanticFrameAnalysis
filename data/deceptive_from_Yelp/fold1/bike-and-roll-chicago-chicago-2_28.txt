Went to the Bike and Roll on Wabash and Wacker and had a tour with Anthony.  He was amazing! He was so incredibly personable, knowledgeable, and patient with the newbies!  It felt like he was part of the family by the end of the tour.  He didn't once let the bad weather affect the tour at all.  We had an amazing time, learned all about the great city of Chicago and were master segway riders by the end of the tour.  We will definitely be back again, and we'll ask for Anthony for sure!
