We enjoyed Bike and Roll in San Francisco 2 yrs ago and riding the Golden Gate to Salsalito was great. So we thought we would try them again in Chicago. Same results...good bikes, easy rental process, easy return/drop off-especially from a different location. I will always look for a Bike and Roll when visiting a new city.
