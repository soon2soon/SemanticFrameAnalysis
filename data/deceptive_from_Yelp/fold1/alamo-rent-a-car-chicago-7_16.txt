Alamo MDW in Chicago is by far the best in customer service and selection of cars at the airport. The Customer Representatives are always friendly and helpful. They make sure you understand all of the options available with helpful tips based on your travel needs.  I've traveled weekday, weekend, morning and afternoon.  Although week days are a bit busier due to business travelers, it's still a pleasant experience.  The big plus for me with Alamo is that they DON'T secure a deposit on your credit card. I've never understood the competition's enormous hold on the credit card to be released 3-5 days later. If a customer has a valid driver's license, credit card and insurance, I think it's a safe bet that the car will be returned or suffer the consequences....which will be a lot heftier than $350-$500. I'm now an Alamo insider because customer service and their cars are EXCELLENT!
