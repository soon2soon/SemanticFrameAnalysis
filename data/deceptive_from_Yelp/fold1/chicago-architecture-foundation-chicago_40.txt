This is my first ever visit to Chicago where it wasn't a layover at O'Hare.  :-)  Chicago is a great city.  My friends and I decided to see it from the river.  Victor is the BOMB!!!  Great tour guide.  Exceptionally knowledgable about not only the architecture but the Chicago-based firms, down to the actual names of inidividuals.  He told Chicago stories, "rumors", and history with great flare.  Because of him, that was the best riverboat tour I have ever taken - including ones I have taken in Europe.  They should give Victor a huge raise.
