Wow,  Only tour I needed to take.   I didn't realize that we were going to have a little bit of everything.  Neighborhoods, Buildings, History , Chicago Hotels, Pubs and on and on.   The Hollywood movie clips we saw were also awesome.   Pat our tour guide was great.  I really don't think that the website for this tour does it justice.  It definetly should be called Hollywood and more... Only negative was that it was a little long however the day I went the traffic was bad .  A++++
