This was amazing! Took my boyfriend for his 25th birthday and had a blast. It was his first time in Chicago, and it was a great way to introduce him to Lincoln Park. Great beer, fun facts, amazing guide, fun group of people. Perfect amount of time at each bar. loved the bacon! would definitely recommend it.
