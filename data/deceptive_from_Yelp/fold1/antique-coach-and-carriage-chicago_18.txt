This past Friday my daughter & her friends had their senior prom. I thought a carriage ride would be a different and enjoyable way to end their evening. I spoke to Debbie reserved 4 carriages and was able to prepay the entire adventure. When they arrived 4 carriages were waiting & ready to go. They rode around the city & absolutely loved it! A few of the girls said the carriage ride was the best part of senior prom! To make things better for them, the hummer was even able to park where the carriages were waiting for them! I would definitely recommend a carriage ride!!
