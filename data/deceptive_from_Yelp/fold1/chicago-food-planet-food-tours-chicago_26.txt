Went on the Chinatown tour and it was the BEST. I highly recomend this tour. We had so much food and it was great to hear the history. I have lived here all my life and have never done this and will do it again. I recommend bringing your out of town friends next time they come to town. Carlin was the best, she was so friendly and made us all feel relaxed and welcome. She sure knew her stuff. Thank you CARLIN!!!!!
