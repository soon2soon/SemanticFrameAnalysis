Just came back from the Guatemala tour.  If you like sitting on bus for long periods of time this is your tour!  The bus rides were extremely long and uncomfortable.  The last day of the tour was a 12 hour ride from Peten Province to Guatemala city. It was horrible with travel on a one lane road all the way back to Guatemala City.  The tour director was obnoxious and never stopped talking so clients were unable to rest.  What a non-vacation!  As stated earlier...you must love sitting on a bus and listening to the tour guide drone on non-stop for twelve hours at a time.  Proceed with caution!
