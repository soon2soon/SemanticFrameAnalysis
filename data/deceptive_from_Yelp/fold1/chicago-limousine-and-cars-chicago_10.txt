I've used Chicago Limousine for over 6 years now.  Each week my driver arrives  early at the door awaiting my exit.  99% of the time any delay at the airport is related to the failure of the City of Chicago to improving the Limo/taxi lane or just plane construction. Chi-limo makes it very easy to do business with them with.  I use their iphone app to book, reserve, cancel my reservations.  I can see my historical invoices on PDF.  And any questions about billing are promptly answered. I have found this company to be very reliable and often referred them to other colleagues.  I also use their services to pick up my extended family.   I rate them FIVE stars.
