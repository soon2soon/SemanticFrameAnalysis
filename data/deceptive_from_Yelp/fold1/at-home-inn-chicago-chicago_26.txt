We planned a 3 night weekend trip to Chicago and could not find a hotel for any sort of reasonable price so we started looking for alternatives.  We had never experienced a rental apartment before, so we were a little leary, but after this trip, we will always look for these types of accomodations and would definitely recommend At Home Inn Chicago to other travelers.   The At Home Inn Chicago staff was easy to work with on the phone while we were investigating possible locations and were very prompt in meeting us at the location so we could get the key and then meeting us again when it was time to leave.  They were very accomodating with an early check in and a late check out as well.  We had talked on the phone with a few other apartment rental businesses and they seemed more interested in getting the person who would stay the longest rather than trying to help travelers. We ended up with an apartment right on State street in the middle of downtown Chicago.  The apartment was very roomy and had a full kitchen (which we used even though we thought we would just eat out every day), living room and dining area and a seperate bedroom with a queen size bed and a bathroom.  It was HUGE compared to a typical hotel room in Chicago and was MUCH less expensive! There were a few minor things that needed attention in the apartment such as a broken door under the bathroom sink and there were some loud noises in the ally outside the apartment that woke us up a few times, but we were right in the middle of downtown, so that was to be expected. Overall we would highly recommend the staff for At Home Inn Chicago and definitely plan to use them again the next time we are in Chicago!
