We had a great stay (4 nights, for vacation). The hotel is in a perfect location as a tourist - we walked nearly everywhere (a few times taking the metro up North to see shows and go to Wrigley Field). It's also walking distance from all the metro lines. Our room was very clean. It was a bit on the small side, but we are used to tiny European hotel rooms, so we had no problem with it. Our room was very clean and had excellent ventilation. The hotel also does a happy hour from 5-6, offering free beer and wine. We thought a drawback was no wifi, but were told on the second day that by signing up for their rewards program (it was free) we got free wifi.
