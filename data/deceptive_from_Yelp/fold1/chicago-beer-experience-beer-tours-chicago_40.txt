I had about 8 friends in town (I'm 28) from college and I figured this would be a good idea to get our Saturday started.  It was AWESOME.  Every one of us had an absolute blast.  There were about three other couples who were on the tour too and we were all having a lot of fun together.  The tour guide kinda made the tour.  He knew what he was talking about but also really personable and fun.  We were looking to have several beers, and we were able to do that for sure.  We actually had a pretty good buzz going by the end of it.  Two of the other three couples were a little bit older and they took it easy, so there's no pressure or anything and the tour guide really catered to each person/couple.  I actually think the two older couples had the most fun.  They were loving it.  Not only was the beer good, but there was actually a stop at one place where there were BACON pairings.  It was unbelievable.  We of course were kinda rowdy but everybody was making jokes, including the tour guide, and overall it was a blast.  I'd give it a 10 out of 10.  It was a perfect way to see a different area of Chicago and my out of town friends loved it.  I highly recommend it.
