We had a great stay here in September 2012, and were there for three nights. We were in a female dorm room that was located on the basement floor of the hostel. The building and facilities were kept very clean and tidy, and the beds were pretty comfy and squeak-free! Front desk staff were helpful and friendly, especially when I needed to store my excessive amount of luggage and access it daily. We were there during a busy weekend, as there were several groups of travelers, but everyone was courteous and friendly. The breakfasts in the morning were standard but good, toast and bagels and fruit, no worries. Our only real complaint would be a few other guests that stayed in our room, slamming doors and turning lights on in the middle of the night, just generally being inconsiderate. This in no way effects the quality of the hostel or it's staff or facilities, just shows that I'm just a little too old for the dorm rooms! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others visiting Chicago.
