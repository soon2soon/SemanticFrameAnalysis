We took the Segway skyscraper tour yesterday and it was AWESOME!   It took about 25 min to get all 16 of us first timers trained individually on the Segway.  Our guide Ryan was very patient and made sure I was 100% comfortable.  It's all about finding your balance and trusting. :). If you are nervous, I suggest you be the first one to get trained so you have more time getting used to it before the tour.  We started on the path by the Chicago river (less crowded) all the way to Soldier's Field via the lakefront - breathtaking views - and went back through N Michigan Ave (more crowded).  Our group guide Anthony was fun, knowledgeable and kept us moving at a good pace with mandatory breaks to ease our tired feet.  I highly recommend taking this tour around the beautiful city with bike and roll Chicago.  Thanks for a fantastic and memorable adventure! PS: This bike and roll location was not easy to find as it's a little shop across from the seventeenth christian science church.  We found a cheap valet parking garage in the mb financial building on wacker road across the street for $6 only (till 4pm)!  Garage door will open when your car approaches.
