Tried out the pizza and cocktails on a Thursday night. We went to Flo & Santos, Coalfire, Sono Wood Fired, and ended at Pizano's. The tour guide was pretty nice but recommended me to check out the daytime version if I wanted more of a history tour of pizza in Chicago since alcohol can make people gabber on in a group. A nifty thing that's not in the daytime version of the tour besides the alcohol is that at the last stop they bring out dessert as well, definitely some of the best deep dish ice cream cake I've tried. Will be making it out to the day time version the next time I'm out in the area.
