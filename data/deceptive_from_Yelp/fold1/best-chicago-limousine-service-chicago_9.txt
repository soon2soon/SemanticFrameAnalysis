My teenage daughter found and booked Best Chicago Limousine Service and from day one the response time and service has been exceptional. She and 7 others booked the limo for one of their friends sweet sixteen bday party last weekend and the limo was on time and the driver was polite, helpful and extremely professional. He treated the group with respect and made their night out the best ever.
