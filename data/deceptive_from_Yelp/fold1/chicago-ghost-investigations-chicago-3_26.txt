A couple of my friends and my 22 yr old son came along with me for this.  I wanted to learn more about this other side because of things I have been experiencing.  I was a little apprehensive at first but as soon as we got in the building our guide made us feel very comfortable.  Apparently I was one who brought my own ghost.  My brother was killed in a car crash last nov and we made contact with him.  The ghost box allowed him to communicate things to me.  There was another couple, complete strangers to us, who heard everything we did.  The best part was hearing, "love you."  We made contact with a few others also.  This was everything and more.  I got quite a few pics of orbs also.  On a personal level, I got the peace I needed.  I'm definitely planning a trip back and would reccomend this to anyone wanting to explore the paranormal.  These guys do it right and have good relationships with the resident ghost.  This is the real thing and an amazing experience!
