This is such an amazing experience!  I promise, encounters with ghosts has to be one of the best experiences that you'll have in Chicago. This tour is just like the  'Ghost Hunters' or 'Ghost Adventures' shows except that you are the investigators.  And I can tell you, that even if you are a skeptic, this tour will seriously make you question that.  There were just to many unexplained events on the tour to be purely coincidental. Plus, the guide, Lisa in our case, was extremely knowledgeable, polite, and down to earth.  She even gave us a ride back to our Hotel.  Brian the owner of the company is great too. +1 for this tour.  I'll definitely check this out again.
