Last night I went on my first Chicago Dine-Around tour and it exceeded all my expectations. My husband and I went on the tour with two other couples and this was the most fun we've had in a while. Great food, fun crowd, easy transportation, awesome, professional host and progressive dining - what a unique concept. Â I highly recommend this adventure for Chicagoans and tourists!
