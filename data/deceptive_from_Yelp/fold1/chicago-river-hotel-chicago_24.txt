This hotel has been decent until the experience I just had. The rooms are a little drab and not many amenities. Appears fairly clean but is not very cozy. My real problem? I have a huge business meeting in the morning and my fire alarm starts "chirping" as I'm in bed falling asleep, at 11:30 at night. I called the front desk and they said "oh we'll send one of our guys up right away." Their response time was fantastic, but really? Sending a guy up to the room of a woman who repeatedly tells the front desk "but I'm already ready for bed and in bed". I realize there may have been no other way to resolve this and the employee who responded was nice and was in and out. The whole experience is annoying, is now affecting my sleep, and made me uncomfortable as I'm traveling alone. Oh, and while I realize it was the quickest solution, there is now no fire alarm in my bedroom. Hopefully no fires!!!! Seems safe.
