Chase Limousine is pretty awesome. I do a lot of Business in Chicago, so I'm traveling to Chicago at least 7-8 times a year. I was getting upset with the Limo company I was using before. So I called my buddy up and he told me about Chase. I've used chase about 4 times now. They have been great everytime. I usually arrive and leave Chicago really early and they are always on time to pick me up and drop me off. I will continue to use them.
