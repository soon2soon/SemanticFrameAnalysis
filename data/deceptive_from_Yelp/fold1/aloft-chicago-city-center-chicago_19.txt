Very disappointed in our stay this year.  We stayed at the Aloft in December last year for over $100 less per night.  We enjoyed our stay so much in 2013, we decided to stay again this year even with the huge increase in cost.  We arrived, unpacked and then discovered the A/C did not work.  We had to repack and move one floor up - same room.  A/C worked but we got no cell phone service and limited Wi-Fi access - off and on.  One night, the cable went on and off.   The window didn't close all the way increasing the outside noise.  one window shade was out of shape and did not close properly. All the above coupled with facing a brick wall with very little natural light available made our stay less than comfortable.   We made an annual trip to Chicago from California for a Bears game and likely won't be staying at the Aloft next year.
