I'm a very biased member of the CAF, and love their tours.  All the docents are volunteers with rigorous training that each develop their own talking points which makes each tour unique.  I love the walking tours because I learn something every time plus it forces me to walk a little slower the next time I'm strolling next to these great buildings we have in Chicago.  Seriously, if you're a history nerdette like me, the membership is one of the best values in Chicago!  Depending on your kids' attention spans, ages, interests, and maturity level, the one-hour tours may be the better bet.
