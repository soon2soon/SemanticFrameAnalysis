I took the tour yesterday and I think learning to ride the Segway and the tour itself, was one of the most unique and fun things I have done. Paul was our instructor and guide and did a great job doing both. The tour took us to places where we had fantastic vistas of the Chicago skyline and Paul was brimming with interesting tidbits and facts behind some of the buildings of the city. It was enough fun that I will probably go on one of their other tours in a forthcoming visit.
