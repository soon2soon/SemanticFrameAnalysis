My husband and I had a BLAST!!! Crystal our Guide was Awesome. It was our first time on a Segway and I was a little nervous but it really was easy!  Crystal was patient with the teaching process. and had a lot of information about the city. We will be back again!! Thank You!   But please put those helmets somewhere they won't get wet!!  That was the only bad thing, putting on a wet helmet! :)
