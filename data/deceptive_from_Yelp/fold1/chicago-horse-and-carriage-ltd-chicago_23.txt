This was a lot of fun and interesting. We had a new horse being trained for the streets of Chicago. The trainer was from Poland and didn't speak much English, but the horse understood and we had no issues with a new horse. Both drivers took us through old Chicago. Great ride and not vey expensive for a 30 minute tour. Everyone should do at least once while near the Magnificent mile.
