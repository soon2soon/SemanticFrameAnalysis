I was in Chicago for Labour Day weekend and decided to take the Chicago Crime Tour. I took this one because there was a Groupon being offered for it. I had a pre-existing fascination with and decent knowledge of Chicago crime, but our tour guide, Clarence, made it so much more exciting. Clarence was the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable tour guide I have had. His very genuine excitement in telling the stories that made Chicago what it is was pretty infectious. That was necessary considering that the bus had no PA system and it was blazing hot outside. The seemingly arbitrary tour route helped learn the city a little better. Great tour. Great guide. Highly recommended.
