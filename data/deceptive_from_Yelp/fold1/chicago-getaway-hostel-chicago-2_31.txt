A friend and I came to Chicago for the Pride parade and stayed here. This place is above and beyond excellent. The check-in guy on duty met us before we were even on the front steps and was totally friendly, helpful, accomodating, and all around great. He even asked me what song I was humming and played it on the lobby's speaker system! The amount of free stuff that they provide for guests is unheard of in a hostel. Free breakfast, free dinner on BBQ nights, free wifi, free internet stations with free printing, free pool tables, free guitars, free soap and shampoo in the showers, free storage if you need to check out early. I even heard that they provided free netbooks if you asked for them! In the interest of being fair-handed, I have to say that the bathroom was hotter and damper than a jungle, but I'll take a hostel with a hot bathroom and great staff, free toiletries, food, internet, etc. etc. any day of the week.
