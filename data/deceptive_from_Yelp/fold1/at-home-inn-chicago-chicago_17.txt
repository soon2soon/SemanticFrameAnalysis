I stayed at the North Side Suite 2 for five nights.  There were six adults and one child in our party.  Booking was easy and I was able to reach the owners easily with questions (actually, two adults arrived a few days late and we weren't charged for them!)  Upon arriving, I found the apartment to look exactly like the pictures.  Everything was spotless; there were enough towels, linens, and kitchen items; and the information booklet included everything we needed.  The apartment is in an adorable neighborhood with a playground across the street and numerous parks close by.  It was also only a few blocks away from the El, a coffee shop, grocery store, convenience store, and restaurants.  The apartment advertises that is sleeps 6, and it does with the pull-out sofa.  It did get a little tight, but certainly do-able, and I didn't hear any complaints about the pull-out! I'll be saving all this information for a future stay, as this is a great alternative to nightly rates at a hotel.   I would highly recommend this apartment for a family stay, or any other reason you might be visiting the amazing city of Chicago!
