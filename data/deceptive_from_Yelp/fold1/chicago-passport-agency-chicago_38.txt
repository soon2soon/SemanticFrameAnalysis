Wow nicest agency for getting your documents! I live 5 hours away, when I planned my trip I only left 30mins to spare. Huge mistake I did not factor in morning traffic spent about 1h30min in traffic. I was so frustrated and was about to turn around but I'm like I traveled 4hours and just to turn around, the worst they could do is say no. if so I'll just have some chicago pizza, relax then drive home. So my appointment was at 8:30am after traffic, parking, security screening(10min), waiting in line(5min) it was 10:12am. I gave her my confirmation number, she did not say anything about being late. I brought the wrong birth certificate lucky I was born in chicago. She told me to go to a building and get it printed off and come back did not have to wait in line. When I came back It was packed good thing I did not have to wait in line. Took about 20mins after wards, they told me to come at 3pm!
