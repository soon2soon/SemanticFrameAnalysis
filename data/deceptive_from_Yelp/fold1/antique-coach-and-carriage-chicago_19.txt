I was pleased with the service I received when I took a carriage ride with Antique. Our driver was kind to us and her horse. Some of the drivers seemed a bit gruff, but know that there are kind ones too. As for the carriage experience I found the gentle motion of the carriage to be soothing and calm, and a nice chance to see the city lights and also enjoy the quiet company of my friends (you get a nice sense of privacy if you ask for the windows to be up). Maybe it's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. If you really want to see the city, ask to have the top put down. I think these horses are well taken care of. You have to keep in mind that a horse at rest will hang his/her head and cock one foot up. When you see horses looking like this while waiting for customers, they are simply taking a break. Our driver actually told us that there would be a short wait since her horse needed a rest between rides. Â Plenty of these horses were lively and curious. They were clean and well fed, and upon asking a few of the drivers where they stayed, I found out that they have 2 weeks per month rest on a ranch southwest of the city. Overall I had a really good experience and would recommend Antique highly. Remember to tip your driver well. It turns out they see very little of the $40 you pay for a ride, and rely on tips to make ends meet.
