PSA - dont go here around tax time as there are 10,000 clowns standing around waiting to file tax extensions. Took me 1.75 hours to get through security at the base of the building. Actual passport agency was fine, aside from the annoyance of being unable to surf your phone as you wait, in and out in 15 min with a next-morning pickup time for my passport.
