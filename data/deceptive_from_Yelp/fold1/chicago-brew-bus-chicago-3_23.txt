Great concept and breweries, but not too comfortable on a normally hot day without air conditioning.  The high temp that day was about 82 and the a/c was broken so they rigged a fan to a cooler which did little.  Small windows at the top of the bus were closed and it was cooler outside.  Beer and heat are not a good combo.
