The Affiania is a boutique hotel in a great location, with a reasonable price. Â Not cheap, but for what you get in terms of service within the hotel and location, it's worth it. It's not getting a four star due to shady (and expensive!) valet/parking service, and lack of eateries that do not require a reservation within close proximity to the restaurant.
