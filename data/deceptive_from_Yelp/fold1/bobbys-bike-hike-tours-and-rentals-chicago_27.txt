Perfect way to see the city!  We did the neighborhoods tour on our first day, which was perfect. You see a lot of different areas and can decide where you want to go back to see more.  Also have an option to keep the bikes for the rest of the day for a nominal fee - would recommend as it beats walking between all the spots you want to see!  Our tour guide, David, was very friendly and provided great info on the city and local attractions. Would highly, highly recommend Bobby's Bikes!
