We had a wonderful experience on our dine around. We d id a public tour for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was the perfect dinner event in Chicago. How else can you experience what three different city restaurants have to offer without having to worry about reservations and parking? The food was great, we did not leave hungry! and Brandon our tour guide was excellent. I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion or fun night out. Our tour was a good mix of chicago residents and tourists, and everyone had a great time.
