Things I was happy with: -the size of the room -the walk in shower -the location -the room's view on the 17th floor -the maid service -it was new -the price Things I was not happy about: -Lighting in the bathroom was scary flourescent, gave me low self esteem everytime I looked in the mirror :O -the lightswitches- didn't make sense how to easily turn on/off desired lights -the lack of door to bathroom- kept sleeping person awake while other was getting ready -the most important thing about a hotel? THE BEDS! They sucked. Very uncomfortable like they were old and had two sunken in body shapes on each side. the sheets were gross polyester which made my hair extra static and the pillows were all too large so i slept with my head at a crooked angle. Also the comforter was covered with a sheet (not a duvet cover) that kept coming off and exposing the duvet - gross! Didn't sleep well for 6 nights! i give the bed 1 star! -the window shade was broken
