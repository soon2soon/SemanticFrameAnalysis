Great way to try different kinds of pizza and learn about the city!  Before we even went on the tour, we had such a great experience coordinating our tour with the owner Jon; he was so easy to work with.  Danny was our guide and totally awesome.  Not only was Danny super knowledgeable about the pizzas, pizzerias, pizza makers, and the city of Chicago...he was a ton of fun!!  We started the tour at Pizano's and went to Coalfire, Pizzeria da Nella Cucina Napoletana, and ended at Pequod's.  We got to try an awesome variety of pizzas from Chicago Style Deep Dish to Neopolitan to coal fired (the n'duja was amazing!).  This tour was so much fun and with so much great pizza!  Definitely go hungry, and you won't be disappointed!
