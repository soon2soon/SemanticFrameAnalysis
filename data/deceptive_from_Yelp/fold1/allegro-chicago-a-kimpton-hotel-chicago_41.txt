Donna's Custom Flowers has never reviewed a Hotel before... but this Hotel Allegro is definitely "Top Notch"! The cleanest Chicago Kitchen I have seen.... The staff was very friendly and helpful during our set up process. The back room elevator went straight through the kitchen and into the ballroom. The staff showed us where to store the boxes for our rental items and assured us that all my rentals would be in safe keeping. I watched the wedding coordinator walk my customer every step of the way... It was relaxing to see the process run so smoothly. Â The food smelled delicious.... My staff was treated respectfully~ As a vender, this is rare. Rest assured, You are in good hands with this Chicago Hotel!!! Donna's Custom Flowers-Donna
