I purchased a Groupon to take this tour during the slower winter months. Our bus was completely full on Feb 15th (maybe 36-ish people?) and it was heated, with comfy seats and large windows. Our guide was Briton and he was fantastic! Wish the tour was longer, just so we could listen to more of his stories and knowledge. Briton was engaging and funny, and he had excellent improv skills. Being from Chicago and up on my history, I was wondering how much more I could learn from this tour, but I was surprised at the amount of interesting, obscure facts I ended up hearing for the first time. We got out of the bus two times to get a more intimate look at a few places (Biograph Theatre and church), but I wish we could have gone inside those places to poke around and visualize what things were like 80 yrs ago. This tour is highly recommended for both locals and tourists alike...had a GREAT time!
