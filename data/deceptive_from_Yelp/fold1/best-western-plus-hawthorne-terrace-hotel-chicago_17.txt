There are lots of fun places to eat and shop but still close enough to the Red Line for all the other Chicago attractions.That is what I get from other reviews. But thereality is so cruel that I have to say something. Although the price is just okay($180/nigh),but I think te arranged room is not big enough.Secondly, we didn't find proper parking space,. The waiter didn't have so much enthusiasm. The appearance of a pair is idling about.. I have no ideas
