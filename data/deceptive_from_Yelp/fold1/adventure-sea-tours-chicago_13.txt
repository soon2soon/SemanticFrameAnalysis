From start to finish everything was perfect!  The crew was incredible, they were so accommodating not only to us, but to our guest. From the moment we stepped on board everything was taken care of. We just had to show up! (and say "I do").   We can't say enough about the food. It was delicious! From the appetizers to the cake! (and if I can add the Cake was scrumptious!)  Everyone had plenty to eat and drink and nothing but good things to say about it all~ Saying "I do" in front of Buckingham Fountain was awesome! Seeing the skyline and Navy Pier under the full moon was breathtaking! Highly recommended! Thanks Captain Val and Crew!
