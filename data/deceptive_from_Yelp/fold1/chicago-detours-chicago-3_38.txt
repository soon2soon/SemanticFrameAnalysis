My friend and I took the "Good Times Historic Bar Tour."  Amanda, our tour guide and the owner of Chicago Detours, is very knowledgeable and offers unique information from interesting old sources.  (You can't get this info on Wikipedia!)  The tour utilizes ipads to display pictures of Chicago history.  My friend and I are from Chicago but we definitely learned new things and will see the city differently after this tour.   The bar crawl aspect is fun.  Our tour was sold out with a mix of tourists and Chicago locals.  (I'd guess that most of the people were in their twenties/thirties/forties.)  Everybody was very nice and we really enjoyed talking to people at the different stops.  You can choose beer, red wine, white wine, or soda.  They have the beverages and appetizers ready when you arrive at the drinking stops so everything is very efficient.   Overall, the Good Times tour is fun and informative.  I'd definitely recommend it to other people.
