Most tour guides present a city as a string of unrelated landmarks, famous events, and restaurants, as they rattle off a list of facts and dates. Â Not so with Chicago Detours. Through meticulous research, multimedia aids, and great storytelling skills, our tour guide, Amanda, brought Chicago to life! I learned about history, art, architecture, transportation, commerce, and local culture. The other patrons were young, intelligent, educated, and friendly. I had an amazing time. I'll definitely be taking another tour with this company again!
