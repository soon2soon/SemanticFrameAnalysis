The condo location, LP21, was perfect for us coming from out of town for a family wedding in Lincoln Park, but that is about all that I can say that was good about it.  The condo pictures online are very misleading. The unit is quite run down, rusted kitchen sink, tiles missing around the bathtub, floor in disrepair all over the unit, cracked floor tiles, and in some areas the wood floor was so severely sloping, they had to prop up the front 2 legs of dressers in the BR with 3 shims so the dresser would sit level. Also,  only 2 coffee cups and 6 plates total in a 4 BR condo???  I emailed the company the morning after we arrived about the deficiencies (hoping maybe they would at least bring us some coffee cups and plates for our group). No response at all to the email!! None at all!!!!  Do yourself a favor and avoid this building. The first and second floor units didn't seem much better as I glanced in the doors while walking up the stairs to our unit (which were covered in very dirty carpeting).
