We arrived at the hotel on Saturday morning and checked in. Did some sight seeing and came back to the room around 4 to change and get ready for dinner. We left our room and came back around 9 to discover that our computer was missing and all of our bags were rifled through. We called security and waited for about 10 minutes and no one came. We called again and they finally came. The security officer who came took some notes and seemed like he had other places to be. He asked us a few questions and gave us a number to call(we called the number and it wasn't for the guests to call, it was the claims department and that was the hotels job). We called the front desk and talked to the manager and there was really nothing they could do because the loss and prevention manager was out until Monday and the security guards had to work out front and watch for the rowdy drunks so they couldn't deal with it right now. We called and filed a report with the Chicago PD.We felt the hotel could of cared less about this. No one was doing anything or has done anything. Who was in our room? Why can't you watch your security footage? Where is the room history of who entered our room? We are worried about fraud and our identity. We had many passwords and lots of personal information on the computer. So now we wait until Marriott claims processes our statement. The way our situation was handled is UNACCEPTABLE!!
