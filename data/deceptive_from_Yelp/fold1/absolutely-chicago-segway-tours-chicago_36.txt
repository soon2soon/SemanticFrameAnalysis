ABSOLUTELY I would recommend taking a Segway tour with this company. The whole staff is accommodating and very knowledgeable about the great City of Chicago. Our guide Brittany made our tour unforgettable and by far made our whole group wanting to come back again! I have raved about our experience to all of my friends and would guarantee that once you have been on a Segway with ACST, you will feel the same. Â Thanks Brittany for making our trip memorable and we hope to see you soon.
