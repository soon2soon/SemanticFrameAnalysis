1st off I only use Alamo where ever I go. the Folks here were great ! They were helpful, in plain site and wanted to assist. Kiosk was a breeze and agents waiting in lot to show you to a car. I always do a walk around inspecting for damage; but before I said I'm doing this they advised it . thumbs up to that!!!! . only draw back I have with Alamo is 50-50 crapshoot on interior cleanliness. this one was ok, Got one in Daytona at end of bike week that reeked of pot, made me sick and they had no other cars
