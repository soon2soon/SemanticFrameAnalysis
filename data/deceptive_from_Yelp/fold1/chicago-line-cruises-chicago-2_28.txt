Have gone on this tour multiple times and it is by far the most informative one I have ever taken. Regardless of which boat you are on, the tour guides all are very qualified and know what they're talking about. The free food and drinks was also amazing. There aren't any other boats or tours I've taken or even heard of that do that. If you are coming to Chicago or even just visiting the city at all this is an absolute must.
