I've been a member for a while and I've seen the service decline. The last time I needed them they left me stranded for over an hour. When I called back to see if the had dispatched a tow truck yet the still had not, and it would be quite a while longer. I asked why the weren't using Stuckman's, the closest local tow company, and they lied and said they weren't in the network anymore. When I called Stuckmans they said they were in the network, but as backup, and that they could have a driver there in a few minutes, but that I would have to pay out of pocket since AAA had not called them. I said fine, since I didn't feel like roasting in the heat for another hour or so. Every other time I've used them in the past few years the wait has been considerably more than the hour they promise, they've showed up with the wrong equipment, etc. Â I've been stranded in sub-zero weather with no heat, 90 degrees with no AC, and once was blocking a mall entrance on a major highway with traffic backing up. I canceled my membership since I can call a tow company myself if I have to pay out-of-pocket. I can only assume that a lot of these 5-star reviews are fakes posted by AAA employees. I've never in all the years I've used them seen anyone show up in 30 minutes. What a laugh....
