We LOVED our tour with Chicago Private Tours.  Our guide, Matthew and driver, TJ were courteous, punctual, very well informed and had a great sense of humor.  They were immediately accommodating when we asked to see a site not on their regular city tour.  They changed the route and still managed to drop us off on time for our dinner reservation.  Everyone from the new college graduate to Grandma enjoyed the experience.  We are still talking about how much fun we had.
