Great hotel with awesome service-we had our dogs with us and so we kind of adjusted the maid service a time or two to avoid having our dogs in the room when they were cleaning, which was great. I was super impressed at the fact that this  hotel has been a Hotel Allegro since the 1920s.  The bed was super comfy, and our room was on the corner of the building so we had two windows with great views from the 16th floor.  Didn't use the work-out room but I did check it out and it is small but has great equipment-if I ever stay there again and don't have time for a real bike ride,  I am definitely going to use the stationary cycle-It has a virtual screen where you can pick courses and also race previous users' times and courses.  Anyway, the hotel is in the theater and government district, which seemed to be a little bit further from the super touristy zones, which was great for our style. It was very close to the L, so we were able to easily use the transit system, and it is in walking distance from a lot of great restaurants and bars with a more local scene.  Great bell hop service too.  Be aware that the walls are thin, and also you can hear everything anyone is saying in their rooms from the hallway.
