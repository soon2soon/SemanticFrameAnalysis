One of the most amazing, intense experiences I have ever had! Not at all what I expected... But in a positive way! I have done other paranormal tours in Chicago that were interesting, but not much more than a history lesson with some ghost stories thrown in. (no actual interactions or indications that ghosts were among us.) but this is THE real deal! Not only did we learn about and get to use all the scientific ghost detecting tools, but we actually communicated with spirits and captured anomalies in photographs! I definitely believe wholeheartedly that this location is very haunted. Don't be surprised if your own personal BYOG ghost communicates with you while you are here. It is so emotional if/when they do, you may want to have some tissues handy! I will definitely be visiting CGI again. It was money well spent for the experience of a lifetime! I'm a believer!
