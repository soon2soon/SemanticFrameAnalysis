Four of us went on the Segway tour of the lakefront at night.  Two parents and two sixteen year olds, one visiting from France.  It could not have been any better!  Learning to ride a Segway was very quick for each of us, going at night was fun because seeing the City lights was a blast.  Jaime B is an EXCELLENT tour guide - some info and some humor - plus he timed our return trip to see the fireworks at Navy Pier!  He did a great job keeping us safe and making sure our two sixteen year olds didn't fall in the lake (not really a possibility) on their Segways.  More fun than we thought it would be.  I want to go again and do the architectural tour of Chicago on a Segway.  Really fun!  Wear good shoes for support.
