My son (17) and I had an amazing time with Absolutely Chicago Segway Tours. Segways are alot more fun then they look. Booking the tour was fine, staff helped us to determine which option would be of interest to us (they offered a few).  The training was quick but thorough. Our guide, Alejandro shared quite a bit  of interesting history about parts of the city,  buildings, sculptures, etc.  Not to mention...the segway was just plain old fun! Thank you, Alejandro, Aaron, Dustin and the rest of the  ACST staff. You definitely set the bar for any future tours.
