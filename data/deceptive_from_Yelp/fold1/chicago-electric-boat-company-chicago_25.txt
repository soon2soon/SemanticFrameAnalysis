I used a Goupon for this (that's how I heard about it).  I have to say we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (friends were in from NYC).  We only had six, but I think one or two more still would have been comfortable.  I grew up going fishing in the the Great Lakes (from Michigan) and to be on a boat and have it so quiet is very much relaxing.  I will say that you should pay attention to the weather (wind) to see how choppy the water may or may not be.  Anytime guests are in town this will be on our list of things to do with them from now on.   PS. The price may seem high at first, but when you consider splitting it between a small group it becomes very reasonable.
