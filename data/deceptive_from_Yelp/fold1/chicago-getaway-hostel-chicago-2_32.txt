You can't beat this for the price... I was a little worried about staying in a hostel because it was my first time, but this place was recently renovated.  Modern fixtures, furniture, and they also have free WiFi and let you print for free.  Bathrooms are fairly newly remodled.  Workers are friendly and helpful with directions.  Its a 10 min walk from the train station and bus stops. I would recomind to anyone looking for a safe and comfortable stay in Chicago!! One down fall, in the room I stayed in for two nights did not have AC but they do give you a fan.
