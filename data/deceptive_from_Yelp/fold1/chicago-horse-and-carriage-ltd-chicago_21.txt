This place ruined my anniversary. I bought a voucher a year ago and wanted to use it this week for my anniversary. They magically decided that the vouchers expire 2 weeks after you buy it, even though it doesn't say that anywhere. They say it says it on the site, but if you go to the place where they say it says it, the bottom of the paragraph is cut off at the bottom of the screen, and you cannot scroll down and see it. I explained this to them, but they didn't care. They said it was a problem with my browser, not their site. Horribly run business, and very rude and impolite people. They stole my $60.
