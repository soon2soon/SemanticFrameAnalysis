This hotel did a great job at making you feel comfortable and welcomed. The executive lounge was excellent. He was very personable and had everything there that you would need or want. Great place to stay when in Chicago. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago for business or pleasure. Great to see the videos in the elevators on the history of the hotel. Pretty impressive to say the least. Great job...Best Western Plus
