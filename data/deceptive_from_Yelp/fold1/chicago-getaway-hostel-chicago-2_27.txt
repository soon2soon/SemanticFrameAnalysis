First time staying in a hostel in America, and wasn't sure what to expect. This place exceeded all of my expectations. Highly recommend it and would absolutely stay here again. Incredibly clean. Room was spotless. Very minimalistic, which is all we needed and what we expected. We spent very little time in the room (which is how any vacation should be, right?), so it was perfect. Cool lobby, lounge area. We arrived at about 1:30am and people were playing beer pong in the kitchen area. Full kitchen if you want to cook, free daily breakfast and free weekend BBQs if you're into that. (We preferred to try to the local Chicago restaurants, though). Very laid back staff. Extremely helpful and full of local knowledge. Giant room in the back to store your luggage after you check out. Location was ideal. Cute Lincoln Park neighborhood has the true Chicago feel. Walking distance to Clark St., which is filled with bars and young 20-somethings. Short cab ride to many of the main attractions. Or walk if you're up for it! That's what we did. Overall, clean, great staff, perfect location, and affordable price -- this place was too good to be true!!
