When I first walked into the hotel I was like wow, what did I get myself into? It was pretty outside my comfort zone in decor, but the price was great when I booked it. Immediately, the front desk staff was very friendly. In fact, they let you order hot coffee, free, in a thermos every morning and drop it off at a designated time. The location was excellent, walking distance to several restaurants and attractions. Initially, were not going to park at the hotel as I couldn't see spending 35 dollars a day but the logistics won out, and they gave us a pass so we could enter and leave as much as we needed to. Anything I needed, the staff took care of including a last minute steaming of my dress for a wedding. When I returned home I noticed something strange on the bill, and when I called the hotel they promptly remedied the situation. The room was small, my view wasn't great, but I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was clean, modern, and the bed super comfy!!
