I went on the Inside the Loop tour with my brother through a deal on Groupon.  Even though we got a deal, however, afterward I would have to say I would gladly pay full price for this or any other tour with this group.  Amanda was our guide.  I can't speak highly enough of her.  I liked how she started by sharing with us how she got involved in offering tours like this.  She said how she was a Rick Steves tour guide in Italy but felt like she'd like to come back to Chicago and offer people a more in-depth look at the many treasures around us right here in Chicago.  The stops on the tour were well-chosen and she really took her time in telling the inside stories while never getting bogged down. She was witty, knowledgeable, and good at promoting an interactive vibe.  The choice to use only four iPads in a group of about 16 was a good idea... it encouraged a team atmosphere and getting to know other people in the group.  I'm pretty sure this was the idea.  The video clips and pictures were well chosen, and the many anecdotes were perfect.   I learned so much during this tour, while being stimulated to go and explore more on my own in the future.  I taught high school for almost ten years, and as an educator, I have to say that Amanda was simply fantastic.  She was never didactic and did not come across as a know-it-all; rather, she displayed great interest and by sharing it with us we caught the interest too.  I am looking forward to the next time I can take another tour with Chicago Detours!.  Highly recommended. What a great service offered to the people of this great city!
