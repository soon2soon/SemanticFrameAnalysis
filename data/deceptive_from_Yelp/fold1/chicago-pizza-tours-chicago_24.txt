I just recently took this tour and have to say it was quite excellent.  The tour guide (Jon I think?) was very passionate and his material was very entertaining.  Yes the tour was about pizza and wow was it delicious, But it was so much more than just pizza facts/history.  I really enjoyed how we drove around to the different neighborhoods of Chicago and he would discuss pop culture facts (like were some famous movie scenes were filmed) as well as interesting history.  I am not a history buff at all (actually I find history really boring) But the places he took us were actually things you'd want to know about that are special to Chicago and he was funny.  Never a dull or boring moment on the bus tour. And now onto the pizza.  4 different pizza styles which was a nice variety.  I enjoyed Ginos the most because I just love the deep dish.  And at first I was thinking 4 pizza places might be too much food but it was the perfect amount.  The bus ride kind of gives you a break between each slice.  And after the 4th slice at the last place I was full and satisfied.   All and all I'd give the Chicago Pizza tours 2 thumbs up and would definitely go on it again when family/friends come to visit.
