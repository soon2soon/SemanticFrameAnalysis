Great little hotel!  I'd definitely stay here again.  The building is a bit older, but very clean and we'll-kept.  What they lack in modern decor, though, is more than made up for by the awesome service!  The staff will bend over backwards to make your stay pleasant, and they are very knowledgeable and helpful.  The included amenities--wifi, breakfast, shuttle--make the affordable price even more attractive.  The shuttle is quick and efficient, and available pretty much on demand. Don't forget to stop by the office and give their mascot Buddy a pat on the head!
