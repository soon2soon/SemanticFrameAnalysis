Celebrated my husband's 40th birthday party on the Valara VI.   We all had a great time. The captain and crew were all friendly and catered to our needs. The bartender made sure everyone had drinks.   Mary Antoniette, their event specialist/coordinator was great to work with.   Thank you Valara VI for helping make this a memorable experience for us all.
