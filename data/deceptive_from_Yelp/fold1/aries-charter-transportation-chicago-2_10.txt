I brought a group of 80 people to Chicago last week, and we needed to divide into multiple groups with three stops a day for multiple days, and I could not have been more  pleased with the level of service. During the contract stages, all my questions were answered promptly and with full detail. I was given the names and numbers of all of our bus drivers well in advance, and all of the drivers showed the utmost courtesy and professionalism. I never once worried that one of the busses wouldn't be where we expected it it be when we expected it to be there. Despite snow and traffic, we always arrived on time or early to our destination, but never felt like the driver was speeding or driving unsafely.  The buses were clean and in great shape.  On our internal survey, 100% of our participants ranked the charter service as 100% meeting or exceeding expectations. I can't thank Aries Charter Enough for making our work so unstressful and upholding the level of professionalism that we wished to convey.
