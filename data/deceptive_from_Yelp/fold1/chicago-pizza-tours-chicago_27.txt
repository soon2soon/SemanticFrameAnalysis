We won this trip through at an auction that Chicago Pizza Tours had generously donated to, and I'm glad we went! Jon did a terrific job not only talking about pizza and the spots we visited but also about Chicago history and landmarks along the way, very informative. You won't visit any chains on this tour, and honestly if we had not been on the tour i don't know that we would have gone into any of these pizza places but I can guarantee we will visit them when we come back, especially Pequod's, delicious deep dish pizza!! We will definitely go on the tour again and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago....just make sure you go hungry!
