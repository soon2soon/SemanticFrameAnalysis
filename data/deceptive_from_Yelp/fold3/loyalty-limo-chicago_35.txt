Loyalty Limo was great!  I was in a bind about a week before the bachelorette party I was hosting, when my previous transportation company fell through.   I contacted Loyalty Limo and they were able to arrange a Navigator Limo for my date and time with no problem at all!  And for a reasonable price. And it wasn't a normal pick up and drop off trip!!  We had arranged a scavenger hunt all around the city- from the northside through the loop- for the bride to be.  Our driver, Emile (sorry if I spelled it wrong!), was great!  He took pictures when we asked, he took us right up to our stops, waited patiently as we completed tasks at each stop, and when he couldn't park and wait, made sure I knew where he would have to move to so we wouldn't be looking for him.   I really appreciated Loyalty Limo's service and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for limo service!
