Pros: -Location, location, location- we were literally a walk or a quick cab ride from every place we went -The room is simply adorable, it almost made you forget that you were in Chicago. It was also very big, which is something we were worried about. -There was ample street parking as well as less expensive garage parking in the area -Free Wi-Fi Cons: -Not sure if he was having a bad day or not, but the tall black gentleman who checked us in was utterly rude and didn't even ask if I needed help with my bags -The room was a bit expensive for it to be a weekday trip All in all my stay was enjoyable. Is this a boutique hotel? No. But it is a cute hotel in a prime location.
