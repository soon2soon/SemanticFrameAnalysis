I am a regular passenger.  At least the harassment of female passengers by train personnel has died down a little.  If you want to take a folding bike on the train, be wary.  Even if you follow the rules posted on the nictd.com website, some train personnel take it upon themselves to bar entry to te train or will harass you. I find this really strange because they don't seem to enforce any of the posted rules on the train.  You can be a drunk passenger bothering everyone, but If you take a folding bike in a bag on the train, watch out.
