We spent a weekend at the House of Two Urns and had a delightful stay. Our rooms were spacious and immaculately clean. There was lots of informations about the area and our hosts gave us great suggestions about things to do in the Wicker Park area.We had everything we could possibly need and more. Kapra is a wonderful cook and was even willing to share her recipe for the waffle syrup she served!!
