I'm actually shocked to see the positive reviews on here for this circus act of a company. We booked them for a pickup at Midway days prior to our arrival with Jim even guaranteeing, 'you made the right choice, you won't be sorry.' Uh oh. Once we arrived at Midway, we spoke to Jim and he said they were having trouble connecting with their driver in the cell phone lot. Isn't that why they created the cell phone lot - so you won't have trouble finding someone? Seems like half the truth to me. Considering we have two small children and stacks of luggage, the news wasn't ideal, but we were willing to wait. From there, things got worse and the runaround continued as now they were trying to find another SUV in the city - to no avail. It was time to move on, cross this company off our list and snag a cab. Jim offered one last salvo that he didn't fulfill, 'we'll comp your ride back to the airport and I'll call you before you leave to set that up.' Needless to say, that didn't happen nor did we expect it to. To call these guys unreliable would be generous, to call them competent would be a compliment, to select another group to pick you up would be wise.
