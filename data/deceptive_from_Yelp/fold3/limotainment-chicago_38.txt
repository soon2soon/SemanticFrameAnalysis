Soooooo my whole experience was great. I was planning a birthday party for a 26 year old female and I could not have been happier with the result. We had no where to pregame and we thought.. why dont we get a party bus.. Now most of peoples experiences with party buses are not good. They are expensive and just a one time event. I will say that I would definitely use Limotainment again. Mike is freaking amazing. As you can see from all of the reviews.. His wife is like the luckiest girl in the world.. I swear I have not even met this guy face to face and I was thinking about this in my head haha. In summary, Mike was great to work with. He was flexible, and just had outstanding business ethics. He wasnt trying to rip you off essentially. I hate throwing these kinds of things honestly, because in the end the person who puts down the money always gets ripped off. Didnt happen. He was THE BEST! even for a 49ers fan. Ok on further to the bus before I sound like a creep. We had a unfortunate circumstance happen to our group in which their needed to be immediate, (i mean immediate a week in advance), adjustments to our schedule and contract. Mike was willing to help. He understood our circumstances and worked with us to make it work. That is someone I would definitely use again. The limo was clean, large and in charge. The lights in their were great. It was very spacious and not crowded. Sound system worked perfectly. THe driver took us wherever we wanted to go. He drove very well and was highly skilled. He showed up 15 minutes early, answered any questions, was very accomodating. Bus was stocked with beer and champaign. Everyone had a great time. So yea.. my reaction WOW. NICE. AMAZING. GREATFUL. APPRECIATIVE.. All that stuff... If you are looking for a bus for a event.. I would say if you do not consider limotainment you are an idiot. Talk to Mike! He will adapt the bus to your needs. He will work with ya... Atleast consider it!
