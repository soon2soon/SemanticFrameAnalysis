So here is the caveat, I never actually got to use the car because I never made it out of my home airport to get to Chicago - but I will tell you that the customer service while my flights were being delayed, then cancelled, then delayed again was outstanding! The dispatcher called me to let me know that they were monitoring the status of my flights and that whenever I knew what was going on or if I got on another flight / airline to let them know. They kept up with me for nine hours! they were kind and professional and wonderful. The car was the one thing I did not have to worry about as my travel plans were falling apart. Thank you to Home James!
