This was my first experience using a travel agent. I had a specific time line and specific needs. Amanda was amazing! She not only coordinated everything for me from trains, lodging, tours and flights, but she also was very sincere in the manner she worked with me. I was traveling in Europe for business and leisure, and she was able to incorporate everything I wanted to get done during my leisure time, while still taking care of business. While I did touristy things, she also customized the trip for my interests. She also was available during my time in Europe to answer any questions or navigate any concerns. Amanda was genuinely invested in making sure I had a positive trip. I will be using her again in the future, and I laud her professionalism and care to everyone I know. Hi-five Amanda!
