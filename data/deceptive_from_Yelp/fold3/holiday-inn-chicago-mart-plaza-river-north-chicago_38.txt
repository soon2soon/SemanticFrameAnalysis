I loved this place! Great great location it is very close to the city. Great view of the wilis tower right from my window! The lobby is super great, cozy, relaxing, and it had a great coach! Also there was an amazing restaurant in the lobby! My room was great! I was on the 22nd floor I had a great view of the lobby and the city! The beds were super comfy. The bath Pom was super nice too! Also the employees were very helpful and nice. I would totally recommend this hotel'
