I've visited L&E at least half a dozen times.  I love it for the beer and whiskey selection (best whiskey list in the city bar none), as well as the cheese platter.  I've only eaten a full meal there twice - mostly because the wait is always horrifically long, ie, over 1.5 hrs with no reservations.  To L&E's credit, their service has always been excellent and they usually threw in a free round of drinks if we waited longer than an hour. If you love whiskey, good food and a mostly upscale hipster crowd at the bar, then this is the place for you.
