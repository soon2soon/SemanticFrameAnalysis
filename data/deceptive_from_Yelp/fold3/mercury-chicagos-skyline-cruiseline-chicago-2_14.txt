Our family thoroughly enjoyed the 6:00 p.m. tour on Saturday, August 26. Our cruise director Cameron rocked! If he was operating from a script, it was hard to tell. His patter was engaging and entertaining, not to mention enthusiastic! When he learend that one member in our party of ten was celebrating a birthday, he led the tour group in a chorus of "Happy Birthday". We are all in agreement that Cameron made the ride an event to remember. We learned a lot and we had a great time. Awesome!
