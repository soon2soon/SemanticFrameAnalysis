Absolutely LOVE Lucky Dog Sailing!  My friends and I have sailed with them two summers in a row (the first time using Groupon).  We just sailed again on Saturday.   The boat is beautiful and very well kept.  Captain Tom & Kristi are incredibly friendly, good people.  We sat back and relaxed the entire trip.  They are fantastic hosts.   We will definitely go again next summer.  I would highly recommend Lucky Dog Sailing to anyone who wants to enjoy a relaxing day on the lake.
