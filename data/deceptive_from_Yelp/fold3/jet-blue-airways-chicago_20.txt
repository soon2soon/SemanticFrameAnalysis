Before traveling on JetBlue, I was skeptical since I haven't heard much about them.  My skepticism turned into a pleasure surprise once I arrived at the counter.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  This great customer service continued on the plane.  Plus, there was plenty of room and individual TV monitors for every seat.  I will fly JetBlue again.
