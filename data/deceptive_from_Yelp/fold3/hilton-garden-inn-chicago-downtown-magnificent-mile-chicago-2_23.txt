HORRIBLE!  Never will I stay there, or recommend this hotel.  It was loud, mosey, and slamming doors just to start.  They overcharged me from the beginning!  I'm being charged 4 times to my bank account.  My bank had to call 4times to get the charges reversed!  They have no sympathy for their mistakes!  Front desk was rude, and didn't bother saying hello, or ask if we needed help with our baggage.  I'm still disputing a charge as I'm writing this....I'm on hold.  I called for the manager, ans suddenly she isn't available!  Really!!  I'm calling corporate.
