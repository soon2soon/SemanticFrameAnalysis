There were 8 of us from 5 countries (Japan, Germany, France, India and America) staying in Chicago for a Fall break. 1 older couple and 6 college-age individuals. We took the Blue Line CTA Division Street Connection and easily walked to the Hostel. We arrived the morning of Oct 12, 2013 and stayed 2 nights.  It was the weekend of the Chicago Marathon and everyone was booked Oct 11th, even HJ, but we were able to stay the 12-14th thankfully. Holiday Jones had just opened 2 weeks prior and already had a full house. The accommodations were great. The first night 3 of us stayed in a private room with a shared bathroom. The bathroom was clean and well taken care of between the guests. Then we stayed in an ensuite bathroom the second night. The five others had 2 joined rooms with an ensuite bathroom.  All of our experiences were very good. Breakfast was easy and friendly. There were people from all different countries.  Oatmeal, cereal and bagels for breakfast when we were there, a great amenity for the low prices.   Everyone at the front desk was welcoming and helpful and went out of their way to serve our needs. The front foyer room was great to sit at the table and hang out or sit in the soft chairs and visit with other guests.  Well done, Holiday Jones on Division St.- Chicago! We'll be back! Suzanne
