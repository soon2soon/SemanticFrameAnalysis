This is directed at the Southwest Service.  If I could Metra a negative rating I would.  There hasn't been a week where I'm either late to work or late coming home.  It has the reached the point that my employer no longer accepts "late slips" from SWS because we are constantly late.  I work 2 blocks from Union Station and yet I still can't make it to work on time.  The morning train I take is supposed to arrive downtown at 7:25 a.m.  but I still can't make it to work by 7:45 a.m.  Again -  I work 2 blocks away from the station.   Half the time we are late we don't receive an explanation - it's just because.  I'm pretty sure the excuses Metra provides are all lies anyway.  To add insult to injury starting next year I get to pay more to be late to work.  Way to go Metra - you suck.
