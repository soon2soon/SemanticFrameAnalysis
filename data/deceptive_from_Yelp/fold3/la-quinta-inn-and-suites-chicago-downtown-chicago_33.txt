never have I been so disgusted with the service of a hotel!!! I stayed here for a weekend with my girlfriends for a birthday and when we arrived we had reservations for 11 am that were confirmed the previous day, the front desk people told us we couldn't check in till 3! we than sat in the lobby for no more than 10 minutes planning what to do because the service messed up our plans we were asked to leave the lobby!!! later they informed us of noise complaints yet we were not loud and the rooms nearby were empty?? hmmm our refrigerator Â was broken and we waited for a handy man to come who brought a new fridge that smelled of fish and made our entire room stink! he than took forever to bring us a third fridge... later a rude woman barged into our room without knocking to tell us we had left too many times.... like what??? how is she gonna tell us when we can leave! these people crazy do not come here!
