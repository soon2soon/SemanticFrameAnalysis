My husband and I just got back from spending three nights here.  It was our first B&B experience and a wonderful one!  The owners were out of town the first day we were there but the substitute inn keepers were very delightful and talkative.  The owners have a very lovely B&B and the food was much better than I even expected.  It was a wonderful experience in a hip neighborhood.  If we ever return to Chicago, we wouldn't think of staying anywhere but here.
