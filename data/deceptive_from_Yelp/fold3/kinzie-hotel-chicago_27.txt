Such a great hotel! Booked through HotelsTonight app and was pleasantly surprised - friendly staff, great location downtown, good sized room/bathrooms, and awesome amenities. The Cocktail Hour was the cherry on top of a great stay - complementary hors d'oeuvres and drink each night. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to friends visiting the Chicago area!
