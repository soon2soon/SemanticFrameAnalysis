What a joke!!!! First off I booked my reservation through Priceline and read on that site that I could call the hotel directly to make sure I had a room with two beds. I did that the very same day I made the reservation. So we were going to Chicago to celebrate our daughters 17th birthday with our 12 year old son, that's four of us staying on the room. When I called they said yes we were booked in a double bed room. We arrived and to our surprise we were put in a room with one king bed. No pullout couch nothing. So we were told sorry they were fully booked and that because we used a third party they could do nothing to help us. We were also told we could possible get a cot. The cot never came so I had to call to ask for one and asked if it was possible to get two they said they would check and call me back. They never did and then showed up about an hour later with one. The man that brought the cot said no way we could get another because of fire hazard. So needless to say we slept terrible!!!! My husband and I slept with our 12 year old son and our daughter slept on the couch. The staff were not the most pleasant either. I do have to say it was very clean and the view from our little room was very pretty. It is a very nice hotel and the location is very convenient. Ready to go home and get some sleep though!
