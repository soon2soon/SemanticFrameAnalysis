We had an amazingly great experience with this hotel. We stayed for 5 days over a weekend for shopping, shows and dining.  When we got to Midway airport an hour and a half before flight time, we discovered that we had forgotten our passports in the hotel safe.  I called the hotel and they offered to deliver them to us at the airport.  The hotel manager, Jim LoveKamp, drove our valuables from downtown Chicago to the airport in record time during rush hour, just in time to get us on our plane.  He wouldn't take any compensation for this either.  All he would accept is our thanks.  Thank you. On a side note about the actual hotel, it was quite nice. I had stayed there before in the summer and liked the location: right in the middle of the shopping of the Magnificent Mile and lots of amazing restaurants.  The hotel restaurant (Weber Grill) was really good; especially the mashed sweet potato with maple butter. It was really nice to enter the lobby and smell a scent that was like lemon tea; it felt like the smell of coming home.   Thanks again, Jim, for a wonderful visit to Chicago and service that was above and beyond anyone's expectations.
