I stayed at this hotel last weekend, and had a wonderful experience. I love that they , supported local businesses on the second floor by holding an event called a pop up market. The general manager was there, greeting guests and locals who stopped by. "Abe Lincoln" was there because of Presidents Day. So fun! Great location. You are close to downtown and can still explore the uniqueness of Lincoln Park. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and accommodating. I definitely recommend staying here. You won't regret it!
