My husband and I have been on the Old Town and the Pilsen tours, both with Joyce. She is very well informed, speaks clearly and well and makes the whole experience a delight. She helped us with good advice about a spot to eat and parking. If she doesn't know the answer to a question she will find out and email you the result. We look forward to more walks with her!
