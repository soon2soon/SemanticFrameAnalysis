This is a great company to do business with! they are looking out for you and want to make sure you have a good night with no hassles. they are prompt with their limo service and get you where you need to go in the timing that you ask. the limo-bus itself is very nice with a very good sound system. well cooled and im assuming itd be well heated when necessary as well (i hired them for Prom in hot weather) the one thing about their limo-bus is that they advertised it as a 30 person bus, and my prom group had but 29 people but the seating was tight with one or two of us forced to sit on top of the drink cooler compartments. the head honcho over at limotainment was super friendly and easy to communicate and work with, ONLY once you got a hold of him. it took a couple of days and calls to get him to pick up my call and before then there was no response to my calls even though i left a voice message.
