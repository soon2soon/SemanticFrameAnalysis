Metra Chicago has very rude employees, especially a conductor Jim B. who is very unprofessional. I rode the Antioch line on the morning of May 24 from Vernon Hills to Union Station.  The conductor punched my ticket twice, as I was using a 10-ride ticket.  As he came around the second time I told him not to but he did anyhow and then admitted afterwards that he had heard me say 'no' but did it without checking first.  That conductor wrote a note in the ticket stating the mistake.  He signed his initials. That evening, I rode the train back home leaving Union Station at 6 pm.  The conductor on the evening train would not honor the mistake and even said it was "my problem.". So he punched my ticket unfairly for the ride back to Vernon Hills. The evening conductor needs to apologize.  His name was Jim B.  He was extremely rude and unprofessional.  It was the worst customer experience I can ever remember receiving.  To blame me for the earlier conductor's mistake is incomprehensible.
