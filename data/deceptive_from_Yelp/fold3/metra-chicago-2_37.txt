Metra sucks! People are packed in like stereotypical cattle/sardines. This creates a public hazard that goes unmonitored by anybody. The weekend schedules are a joke -trains only run every 2-3 hours. The toilets are a mess, and totally inadequate for the amount of people in the station everyday. Now they're cutting back on the puny train washrooms to make more space.Everything is aimed at cutting costs. For those who have a problem it's "tough luck-quit complaining" etcetra. Be thankful you have a train option, right?
