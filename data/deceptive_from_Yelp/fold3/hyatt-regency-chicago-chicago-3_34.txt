One thing I always pay attention to is the bathroom when I stay at a hotel - Does it smell? Are the curtains moldy? Are there enough towels for everyone?- And for the first time ever, this place passed with flying colors! I ended up on the 23rd floor in a double room. We were facing the city so the view wasn't as great, but who cares when you have a super soft bed with 4 pillows? The hotel staff were friendly at check-in and check-out and we had no major issues with our stay. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars - no pool (Why!?) and no internet included (WHAT!?). For a room at that price, internet should have been included. What time period are they living in??
