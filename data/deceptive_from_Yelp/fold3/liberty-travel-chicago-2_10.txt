This was our first time using a travel agent and Alison was amazing! We wanted to book something relaxing for our anniversary, but with all the options online, it became too overwhelming. We asked Alison for help and she was able to not only book an amazing hotel, but she also arranged out tour, transportation, flight information, dinner reservations and she was available if we had any issues. When we did come across an issue with our dinner reservations (the hotels fault) she immediately took care of it and the hotel provided us with complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champagne and our initial dinner reservations! The entire trip was amazing and we were able to relax because Alison took care of everything for us. This was by far, our best vacation and we will be using Alison and Liberty Travel again.
