My husband and I loved the Hotel Monaco -- the location (our room had a fabulous view and the hotel is walking distance or a short cab ride to great shops/restaurants), the service (we needed to catch an early flight home and they arranged to have a cab waiting for us in the wee hours of the night) and the amenities (comfy room, free wireless if you join their loyalty program, great room service)! It was wonderful and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.
