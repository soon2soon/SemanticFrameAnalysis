We booked our honeymoon with Aimee from Island Getaways and I am so grateful that we decided to use her as a travel agent.  This was our first time using a travel agent and we are hooked.  She helped us explore a number of options and was always upbeat and encouraging even with ALL the questions I had (and I had a lot).  She genuinely wanted us to have the perfect honeymoon tailored to our specific personalities.  She successfully did this and we had such an unforgettable honeymoon at Sandals Grande St. Lucia.  Even after we chose our location she walked us through the long list of confusing room categories to help us find the perfect room with the best views that was in our budget.  It did not stop there, as Aimee suggested a number of excursions, the best restaurants, and local things to do to truly experience the island.  She also set up our honeymoon benefits for us and signed us up for Sandals Rewards which gave us double points after we returned home.  We highly recommend Aimee's services (aimee@myislandgetaways.c…) to all our friends and family and will never travel without her expertise which made our ease of travel effortless, especially after all the wedding planning we endured.
