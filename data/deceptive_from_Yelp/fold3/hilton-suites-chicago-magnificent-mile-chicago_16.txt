I recently stayed here to celebrate my fiancé's birthday and I was initially impressed with the room and the space. After doing some shopping on Michigan Ave, we came back to the room to relax. As I laid across the bed I saw the biggest bug that I have ever seen in my life (no exaggeration). I'm not sure what kind it was but it looked similar to a beetle. My fiancé but a garbage can over it and a hotel employee came to get it. I spoke to a supervisor who offered to switch our room out and asked if we wanted to come to the front desk to get the key, which I thought was a bit unprofessional, so someone brought the key up. Shortly after I hung up the phone, another bug appeared. It was smaller than the 1st so I called the desk again to speak to a different manger (Alfredo) who was very professional and refunded 50% of our stay which still isn't good enough when you can't relax or sleep because you're afraid that bugs may crawling on you. I will not return here.
