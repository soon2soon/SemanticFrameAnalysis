Metra, Metra, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1) The deafeningly loud speaker announcements telling us about the 'quiet cars' 2) Airlines: always a 'weather delay'; Metra: always 'freight train interference' 3) Late Slips: ahhhh, just like grammar school 4) The 'time machine' experience: not a bit of technology that wasn't available 50 years ago (you just don't see people with coin changers that often anymore) 5) Higher fares, less service: The government-run formula for success 6) Raindrops keep fallin' on my head: Inside, on the platform 7) Surrealism on display - The scene: Three teller windows open, 65+ people in line, and some guy at the head of the line pointing out the next open window, like after 25 minutes of standing there you haven't figured out the system. The math: go open another window instead of just pointing out the obvious, and instantly achieve a 33% improvement in productivity! Only you, Metra, only you... Yes, I said love, but I have a confession: Metra, you have a rival for my affection. You see, there's this other monument to modernity and ruthless drive to excel: the Post Office.
