If there was a way to give no stars, I would, but the site requires to put something.   I called to make a reservation one Sunday morning, only to be rudely interrupted by the dispatcher's breakfast. I did not think limo offices were in restaurants, but for this company it was at the time.   While trying to give the details, I could not help but notice the clinging and clanging of a fork hitting a plate as it kept being scraped in the background.   Apparently pretending to listen to anything I had to say, the dispatcher was scarfing down whatever was on his plate into his piehole, which was probably a pile of pancakes. The only response I got from the questions asked were a lot of "mm hm's", which makes me think he had shoveled in his mouth a face full of flapjacks. Already annoyed by his customer disservice, when asked to call back later, his response came through sipping his straw.  Because at that point the only thing heard was that irritating sound of a straw slurping on an empty drink, when it is the loudest.       Needless to say there was no return call, and never will.
