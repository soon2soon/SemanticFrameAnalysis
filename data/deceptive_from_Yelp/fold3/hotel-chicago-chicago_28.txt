I've had better customer service a La Quinta.  1) TV wouldn't turn on, but after maintenance never showed up, I got behind it and reset the power (I think an internal breaker tripped) myself; 2) I didn't need my room fully cleaned for a short stay, but when I asked the maid if she had an extra wash cloth, she simply uttered, "No."   Not, "Can I go get you one," or "Can I bring one to you in a little while."  Just "No"; 3) The food at the restaurant was sub-par, though plated like it was high-end.  I was attending a conference and lunch was provided... chicken and two sides. I asked if I could just get a plate with the two sides, minus the chicken.  Nothing special, nothing uniquely prepared for me, just the same plate without the chicken on it.  The waiter mumbled, "no."  I thought it was surely a mistake, so I went and asked the manager.  "No," again. The room, like the hotel, was supposed to look fancy, but it was really falling apart.  The thermostat was clearly broken such that it never kicked off the fan, so it blew constantly on me all night long. Go elsewhere.  There are too many nice places in Chicago to have to be treated like this.
