We just had our reception here in July, and we were treated like royalty the entire time. Kerry Craig was a fantastic help in planning our big day. She answered all of our calls/emails immediately and was very knowledgeable about the whole process- thank goodness- because we sure weren't! Everyone complimented us on the beautiful hotel: rooms, pool, most delicious hotel restaurant ever, helpful staff and free wine tastings. During the actual reception, I had numerous people attending to me and got every last thing I wanted. Also, we had several people tell us that this was the BEST FOOD they ever had at a wedding or any other function, and we happen to agree with them. Plus, the ballroom where we had the reception is stunning with high ceilings, glamorous chandeliers and an outside balcony with a view of the city. It was my DREAM wedding!
