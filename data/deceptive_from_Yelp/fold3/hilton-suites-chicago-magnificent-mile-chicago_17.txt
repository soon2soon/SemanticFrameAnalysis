Woke up in the middle of the night (2:10am), due to Marijuana smell, penetrating through my bathroom and bedroom vents. The smell was so terrible that the whole non-smoking suite smelled as if it was a joint kit. Terrible. I called the front desk and guest services, and they sent someone up with a air freshener spray... it did not help. i did not sleep the whole night and at 6:30am i went to the front desk to ask for another room. I got it, however, the guest services attendant asked me if I could take my stuff out on my own, because there was nobody who could help. finally he asked security to help me out. No sorry, no refund for one night, i even needed to ask if the could transfer my Internet to my new room (they charge $12.95 pr night). This is not what I would expect from a 4-5 star hotel. You can better go to the Westin, same class, same price, much more responsive, and next to the Hilton suites. I always stayed at the Hilton Suites, when I was in town. But no more.
