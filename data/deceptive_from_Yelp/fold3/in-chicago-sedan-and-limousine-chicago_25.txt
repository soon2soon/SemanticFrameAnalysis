Booked Chicago Car Service to take my wife and son to a Hawks game while they were visiting Chicago.   On the way home from the game the driver even took them on a quick tour of Chicago.   That's personal service.   I recommend them highly! By the way I found them through Yelp.   Believe the ratings, this company is for real.
