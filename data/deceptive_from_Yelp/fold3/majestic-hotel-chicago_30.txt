As a frequent visitor to Chicago I have experienced many different hotels and I can honestly say that The Majestic Hotel is at the top of my list.  This neighborhood boutique was a perfect fit for my needs...close to my kids who live in Lakeview, walking distance to the train, restaurants, nightlife, not to mention reasonably priced overnight garage parking right next door.  The room was very clean, professional staff, great continental breakfast..I could go on and on...loved it!  Even the bathrobes were a pleasant surprise.  Oh, and the water pressure was awesome in the shower...just sayin. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay then may be this place is not for you but then again it was not outrageously priced either. I believe it was quite reasonable for the value received. Parking was only $22 overnight, the room was $200 and included two tickets to Shedd Aquarium, I'd say it was quite a deal if you honestly breakdown your costs to stay at a budget competitor.
