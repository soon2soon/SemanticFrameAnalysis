Just stayed at the Hard Rock hotel last Friday November 22nd for a Bachelorette party. We paid for the upgrade to a double bed. The floor we were on was Madonna, that was sweet. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our requests for extra blankets. We got a kick out of the decor with Madonna and also the sensor for the snacks. This would have been a 5 star review except for the mis communication with the valet. We had no problem paying for valet, one girl in our group had her car valet. When we went to check out the next morning we were going to divide the cost for her car to valet and each girl pay some of it. No big deal; however the guy at the front and at the valet said no charge it was part of the upgrade. So the only thing on my bill was the upgrade for the room. However; now that I get my bank statement the valet has been added to the room upgrade. In the future can you please include the valet in the room receipt that is dropped off; or take the money when someone gets their car to check out. Terrie Fox Updating this review, I contacted the hotel and they were able to refund my upgrade charge, while it was not the full cost of the valet, it was something and I appreciate the response from the lady in the billing department. Kudos to Hard Rock for making it right!
