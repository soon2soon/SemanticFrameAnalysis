I rely on the Yelp community for pointers and insight frequently, but this is the first time I was so impressed with an experience I needed to post it myself! The Hotel Burnham is an amazing space, with the quirky elegance you expect from a Kimpton property. The architecture and decor is excellent, and the restaurant in the building (Atwood Cafe) is inventive, fresh and tasty. The location is perfect, looking out on the State St Macy's for shopping and the holiday decorations. But what really sets the Hotel Burnham apart is the staff and management. Through no fault of the hotel's, our New Year's Eve reservation was mis-dated. We showed up on NYE evening to discover this at the front desk. The gentlemen at the desk, Darnell I think?, went far above and beyond the call of duty: finding us a room at the last minute and locating the manager to work a deal with us on the charges. Again, this was totally on their own initiative - we were clear that the mistake wasn't their doing! When we checked out, Suze made sure that all the charges were correct and turned the invoices around before we even got home! The rest of our stay remained at that level of extraordinary service and support, from room service to the restaurant's staff to the concierge and front desk. It is clear that the most important thing to all the staff and management is the quality of their customers' experience and they will do everything they can to make this the best hotel stay you can have. I strongly recommend the Hotel Burnham to anyone looking for a hotel in downtown Chicago!
