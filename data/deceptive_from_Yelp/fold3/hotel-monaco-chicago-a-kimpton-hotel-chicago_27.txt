Stayed here one night while visiting relatives downtown for the holidays, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. THE place to stay if you are bringing your dog. Excellent service from the front desk to the doorman to the restaurant staff. Beds and linens are incredibly comfortable, and the robes are one of a kind.
