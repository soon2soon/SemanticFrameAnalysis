This limo company was incredible. Used 7 stretch limos to transport 70 kids at the end of a scavenger hunt bar mitzvah party. Jorge the owner was fantastic, reliable. Drivers were all fantastic and reliable. The cars were all clean. Can't say enough great things. Jorge even answered one of my phone calls while arranging this all while running the last three miles of the marathon, now that's dedication to your business!
