We went out last Sunday morning for a wonderful sail on the lake. Parking at the marina was a snap. we headed right over to the dock to meet our crew. Captain Tom and Kristi were cheerful and engaging hosts. They went out of their way to make sure everyone had a great time. If you haven't had a chance to see the Chicago skyline from out on the lake, this is the way to go! We'll make the Lucky Dog an annual part of our summer fun from now on.
