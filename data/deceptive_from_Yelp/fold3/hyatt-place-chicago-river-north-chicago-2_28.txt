Lovely experience for a family trip. Helpful, friendly staff, delicious full breakfast, comfortable room. Walking distance to good restaurants, trolley to Navy Pier is across the street. We spent the second half of the week at the Swissotel (for complicated reasons), and I wish we'd stayed here the whole time. Biggest difference between the two: I checked out of Hyatt Place owing exactly what I'd expected to pay; checked out of Swissotel this morning owing about $500 more (breakfast, internet, even the usually-standard coffeemaker in our room cost an extra $20, not kidding). I am feeling warm and fuzzy toward Hyatt Place at the moment! We'll stay here again.
