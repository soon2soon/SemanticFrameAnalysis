What a nice experience to check into a hotel that quickly and politely has your reservation, addresses you like they actually want you to stay with them and makes professional service a priority from all of their staff. Nicely appointed rooms, great location, amazing fitness center-just nothing negative to say about our stay. Â Looking forward to staying there whenever we are in Chicago.
