The owners need to give management more support to screen staff better. When we walked up, we didn't get an offer to help with our bags out of the taxi, and the guys stood there until we were half-way in the doors. On the check-in (4 waiting, 1 staff), we all heard the young man tell someone, "I'm sorry, sir, I wasn't part of that conversation or reservation, and I don't have you checking in on that date." We had our own surprise with this same check-in person, and we asked for a manager. Long story short. He was stunned and put out when we asked, and had to "run upstairs if we really wanted that, leaving the desk unattended." We said, "Oh yes." Randy came and saved the day...and even he got some lip from this young guy and dealt with it patiently and deftly. Amazing. We also enjoyed Leena and Felicia for spa services and tips on local sites. Really, they failed on the first impression, though. I guess check on your reservation here every day until you arrive --- if you stay here. Can't say enough good things about Leena's talents as well --- very nice. She works at several of the other spa properties affiliated with this hotel.
