Jackie and Corey at the Holiday Inn Express made my stay in Chicago a great one. I've stayed at this hotel 3 times and will always come back,  Love the complimentary breakfast.. not just a wrapped danish. Cozy lobby (free coffee)  away from front desk makes it easy to unwind after shopping all day.  Thanks again to the staff, your hospitality was greater than most 5 star hotels.
