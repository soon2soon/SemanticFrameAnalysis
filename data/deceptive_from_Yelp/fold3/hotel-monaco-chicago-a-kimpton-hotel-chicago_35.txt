I've been a fairly regular guest of the Hotel Monaco for the past several years--usually a summer vacation, holiday shopping trip and a couple of weekend get-aways.  The Monaco has been my go-to hotel because its service has been consistently exemplary, its amenities were top-notch and I always felt as if it were my home away from home. We just completed a weekend at the Monaco and, we're sorry to say, things have changed.   The in-room shampoo, conditioner and lotion used to be high-end L'Occitane brand.  A fabulous touch.  This trip, the L'Occitane was gone, replaced by a cheaper product...it actually burned our skin! Our room was showing some pretty significant wear and tear--peeling wallpaper, a hole in the curtain and another hole in the seating chair's upholstery. The biggest let-down for us, though, is in the loss of front desk service.  The Monaco staff has always been world-class, remembering everyone by name, making great conversation and showing genuine care for our hotel experience. This trip, when we approached the front desk to check in, the desk person barely looked up to greet us.  Once we settled into our room, I returned to the desk to ask for the address of a restaurant where we had reservations.  The woman who checked me in said, "the concierge is away.  You can ask him when he gets back."  Mind you, from the angle at which I was standing, I could see that she had Internet access at her work station because she was looking at a Facebook page!  I remember last Christmas when a different desk agent at the Monaco spent 20 minutes helping me compile addresses and transportation options for various activities and even printed maps to show me the way.  This time, though, Facebook trumped a simple Google search to find my dinner spot.   Honestly, we'll most likely stay at the Monaco again this summer.  We have had too many perfect experiences there to simply write it off.
