Their normal hours end at 11pm.  After 11pm there is typically a premium charged.  I was picked up after their 11pm cutoff time frame but they didn't charge me for the extra time...that part was good.  When the driver came, he popped truck but initially didn't get out of car to load suitcase.  When he got out, he walked to back, and I had to ask to confirm "Home james?", he said "yes" and grabbed my bag but he didn't introduce himself or walk over to open my door as a client.  (Ok?)  His dress shirt was completely untucked/disheveled, and he offered no apologies for having me wait 20 minutes because they were running behind even though they promised they'd watch my flight information and be able to confirm when I landed. The car was comfortable and free from smells, but a large spray of oil in the middle of the seat in the back which looked like a half attempt to shine it up.  I didn't see the spray initially and placed my hand there first so it actually made my hand greasy for ride home.  Another point was that during that ride, he didn't say  one word to me until I initiated conversation with him about 10minutes into it.  There was no "how was your flight", "is everything comfortable back there", "would you like music or silence", etc??   I just don't understand the lack of customer service. It was equivalent to paying for a cab ride and getting the same service.  At least I could have hopped in the cab immediately instead of waiting 20 minutes for my driver to show up.  Again, the car itself was very comfortable and it was nice not watching the meter run up so that part make it an "OK" ride.
