We made a reservation through Expedia.ca for our stay in Chicago from July 13-18, 2011.  The pics on Expedia looked nice enough, and the main attraction was that is was in Boystown.  When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised, because it looked even nicer in person, so to speak.  Our room (the Winsor) was beautiful and in a quiet area.  The staff were all very nice, helpful and friendly, helping us with routes to take to various attractions, restaurant suggestions, and were quite knowledgeable about the gay village.  Aside from a wobbly ironing board which I had to ask for, and which nearly gave me third degree burns when it dropped, and a bathroom that seemed to have no motorized fan, it was a very nice place.  The breakfast choices were varied and eating in the beautiful breakfast lounge put us in the right remark of mind first thing in the morning.  The un-room snacks, drinks and alcohol were all very reasonably priced.  Considering the horrendous prices that some downtown hotels charged, this hotel gave them a run for their money, offering great location (near Addison L-line and Lakeshore) and great value for the money.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!
