Granted this is my first review, and typically I cant stand "Yelp" My experience at Longman has thus prompted me to maybe actually use some form of social media to express my experiences eating out. So here it goes, short and sweet. Granted The staff means well and they are all nice people, but frankly the service I received on Tuesday morning was embarrassing. Myself and some friends upon entering were asked to wait at the bar and enjoy some drinks while we waited for a table. We obliged and grabbed some libations. It took a good amount of time because there were some problems with the lines to the taps which is understandable because well, shit happens sometimes. We sat there for 15 minutes and as soon as we got our drinks the host asked us to close our tabs and have a seat at one of the many empty tables inside that remained empty the entire time we were waiting to have a seat at the table that was empty three feet from the bar we were sitting. We sat at the table for 20 minutes working on our drinks waiting for a server to come to the table. At that point we just decided to get up and leave. I have been here a few times, and I was never impressed but never disappointed. I like whats going on here as far as the food concept and aesthetics of the space, but there needs to be some serious improvements to service.
