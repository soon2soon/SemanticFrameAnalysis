My husband and I stayed here 4 nights July 2014.  We were very pleased with the hotel itself.  Make sure to get a room with a city view, we had a room with a view of the back alley.....very lame!!  Also, great location in the city - close to some excellent deep dish pizza (Lou Malnati's), a very cool Irish Pub (Fado), and other excellent eatery's and stores nearby.  Also, very close to Michigan Ave and other sight seeing locations.  We walked everywhere the whole week and loved every minute of it. Also, the breakfast is OK for a couple days but my husband and I were staying at the hotel for 4 mornings and we are huge breakfast fans, so this didn't cut it.  They do have fresh fruit, oatmeal, cottage cheese, etc.  But, as you might expect, the "hot items" were not that hot....french toast, some cold and old and hard breakfast sandwiches, etc.  I've been to hotels with better breakfast.
