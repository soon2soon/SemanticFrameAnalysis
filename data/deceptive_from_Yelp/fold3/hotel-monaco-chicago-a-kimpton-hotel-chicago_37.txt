We stayed at Hotel Monaco the weekend of April 23rd for our anniversary.  We splurged and got the Rock and Roll suite for a pretty good AAA discount.  The room itself was awesome... plenty of room, big jacuzzi, decent view, 2 plasma TV's, and an electric guitar.  The best part was the jukebox, which we were pleasantly surprised to find out didn't cost anything to play.   However, we missed some basics like no pen/paper and no lotion.  A guitar string was broken which made it feel like it's been there awhile.  The jacuzzi looked impressive, but was pretty weak... one of the jets didn't even work.  For the most part we got great service... the bellhop that brought us to our room found out it was our anniversary and said he was going to send us a "gift" that never came... maybe I didn't tip him enough?   Overall a pretty good stay.
