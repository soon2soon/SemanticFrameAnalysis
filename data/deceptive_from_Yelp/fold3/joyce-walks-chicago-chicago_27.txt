If you really want the "Windy City's" history with a true Chicagoan's twist, then you want to take the Joyce Walks Chicago Tour. Our convention group learned more "inside info" and got to see parts of the city other tours bypass. For a group of educators, we got an exciting lesson with the opportunity to ask questions and take lots of pictures. Experiencing Chicago from the ground up was the highlight of our trip!
