Dorina does a great job on her non chip mani. Its a cute small place, with lots of great services. I was offered to try some samples of the dermologica line she uses for her facials and I'm in love with the products. I will def be back to purchase. She also makes beautiful quality handmade jewelry at a great price. Not to mention Dorina is such a doll and a pleasure to talk to. I will def be back. Shes the best.
