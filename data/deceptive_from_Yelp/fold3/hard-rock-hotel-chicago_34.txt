Was recently visiting Chicago and stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Upon checking in everyone was warm and friendly.  I loved the look of hotel. Modern and clean but not too trendy looking.  When I checked in at front desk there was a very sweet young women named Jessica who helped me.  The hotel was not super full and Jessica upgraded me to an amazing suite on the 34th floor with a beautiful view of Chicago... Really enjoyed the whole experience and would come back again.  Also, the food and service were great! Thanks:)
