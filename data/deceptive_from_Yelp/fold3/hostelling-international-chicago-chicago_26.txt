It was my first time in Chicago and first time staying at a hostel , so I didn't know what to expect . The staff was helpful and knowledgeable , Thank you Mike . Mike was great right from my very first call he was helpful in giving me advice on how to find parking and many things to do near by . Kyle pointed me in the direction of great music . Waking up to their breakfast was super , lots to choose from . Everyone was nice , from the front desk to the gals bringing out the breakfast they all made me feel at home . I would recommend staying here to my friends . Knowing what I know now , I would book more in advance .
