I stayed in your hotel on 10/11/2013 in room 865. The hotel room was a gift from my office for my wedding night. When I checked in I was told that I needed to present my credit card, and I explained to the person who checked me in that the room was already paid for, he told me that it would be for incidentals only. So I proceeded to give him my credit card. A little while later I just happened to check my bank statement and I was charged for the room. So I immediately went down to the front desk, and had to explain my situation all over again, that the room was a gift from my office for my wedding night, and I should not have been charged. Now mind you this was about 11pm. So after 2 hours of going back and forth with the front desk personnel, my office manager, and my boss that issue was finally resolved. And by this time is it 1 am and needless to say my wedding night was completely ruined. So the next day we go to check out around 12:15 and valet was called to bring my car around. After waiting outside for almost an hour my car finally came. After valet kept telling me that it was coming. Then a manager finally came out just to tell me that they had lost my car. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you again for RUINING what was supposed to greatest night both of our lives!!!!!!
