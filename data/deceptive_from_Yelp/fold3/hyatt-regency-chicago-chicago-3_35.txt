Scored a great deal bidding on Priceline. This is one of the biggest hotels I've ever stayed in with over 2,000 guest rooms. They are going through some renovations so some areas were closed off but you were able to maneuver around that. Check in was quick even though very busy, staff very friendly and they honored my requests. There are many resturants and shopping in walking distance. Getting to and finding the hotel was easy for my first time to Chicago. I flew into Midway Airport then taking the CTA Orange line train to downtown where the stop is a few blocks away from the hotel. For those flying into O'Hara I think there a Blue Line train also that takes you into Downtown Chicago just find the CTA website for more info.
