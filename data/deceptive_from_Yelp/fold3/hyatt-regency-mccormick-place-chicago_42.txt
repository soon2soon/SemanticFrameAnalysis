Stayed here five nights with two family members, one of whom was attending a professional meeting at McCormick Place, over the Memorial Day weekend. It makes sense to stay here if you have business at McCormick Place, particularly in Winter. No other hotel is as convenient. The tradeoff is that this place is like an airport hotel: it is far from the better parts of town, and its restaurants and shops, and those of the adjacent convention center, are priced to exploit a captive audience. The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, but the hotel's billing policies are somewhat rigid. It is best if the first person in your group to check in has in his possession the credit card that was used to reserve the room. Also, with three people in our group and two beds, the hotel would not give us a rollaway bed due to "fire regulations". Fortunately I asked about the third-bed policy in advance, and brought a sleeping bag just in case. I needed it. The carpets and upholstery were surprisingly worn and dirty for a hotel of this grade. The free wi-fi worked adequately but repeatedly hijacked my ios browser to the hotel's Facebook page. I assume they wanted me to click the like button. The DIY laundry facilities on the fourth floor are clean and inexpensive. I didn't use the gym but heard that it is good. If you want to go to the Loop or Near North the #3 bus stops in front of the hotel and goes up Michigan Ave. Get off at Roosevelt Rd to shop at the grocery stores near Roosevelt and Wabash (the Trader Joe's has excellent bread, cheese, wine etc.). A cab ride from the hotel to W Ontario St cost us $15. The blue "Divvy Bike" rental bicycles in front of the hotel are also a good, fast way to get around in good weather.
