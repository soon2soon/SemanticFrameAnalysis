Wow! Fantastic way to get to Midway!  Coming from NW Indiana, we considered taking the Tri-State Bus to and from the airport.  However, this was rather costly for a family of four and their schedule for tansportation doesn't always coincide with flight schedules.  Since our flight was leaving at 6am and our return flight was scheduled to land at 11:45pm, we decided to look into other options. After reading several reviews and seeing that we could get a discount for extended stay parking, we decided to give Midway Park Ride & Fly a go. We were so impressed with the service and the ease of getting to and from the airport.  It was a breeze.  When we arrived back at Midway, we placed a call, got our luggage, walked out the door and immediately got on the shuttle. Our vehicle was waiting for us, in the same condition it was left.  The driver pulled right up to our spot and unloaded our luggage.  We were out of the lot in a matter of minutes and on our way back to Indiana. We will certainly use this option in the future when flying out of Midway.
