This is one of the best hostels in Chicago. I resided here one weekend in February earlier this year and it was absolutely amazing. The beds were super comfortable. They also have individuals night lights, bright enough to read, write, or any other activities one may need light for at night. The morning breakfast, while not much variety, is satisfying. Fresh orange juice, toast, cereal, etc. Another thing I find interesting is that you wash your own dish; for some reason it gives you that home comfort feeling. There is a computer room available even though you have to pay per minute of use, that's a turn off. However, most of us who live in the common era of the 21st century, will usually have our own technology, so it really didnt bother me. There also common rooms for you to be along. The staff members and guest are very friendly. This hostel is just another great compliment to Chicago's wonderful environment. I recommend this hostel to anyone looking for a great place to stay as they explore the city of Chicago. Its also right in the heart of Chicago, the center of everything.
