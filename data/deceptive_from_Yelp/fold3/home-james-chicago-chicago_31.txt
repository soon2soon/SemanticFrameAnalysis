We used Home James Chicago a couple of times last week-- once to pick up my mother-in-law from O'Hare and once to take a group of us to O'Hare.   It was easy to book the trips and we received e-mail confirmations and reminders.   Both times the driver was there exactly when we requested him (actually early for the trip to O'Hare).   The drivers were extremely friendly and the cars were in great condition.   We'll definitely use them again.
