We had our wedding this past weekend and chose limotainment for our party bus. We had a "first look" at the wedding venue then drove around the city for all the great city photos.  The bus came stocked with beer, champagne, waters, pop, etc.  Our driver, Priest, was great. Dealing with the owner, Mike, was easy. The limo bus itself was the coolest thing any of us had seen. The inside was clean, HUGE, and just overall amazing. The rates were comparable, even better, to other companies we looked at. If we ever need a limo - you can bet we will be calling mike!
