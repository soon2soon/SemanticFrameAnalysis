I came across this spa driving around the neighborhood, since I work in Marketing its hard for me to find a great place around my area that will accommodate my schedule, I need to get a facial done and a massage, when I walked into this place I felt like a was home right away! The place was very cozy and very relaxed, Dorina was very friendly and help me out right away offered me coffee and told me to wait while she was finishing up a pedicure in the spa room! Then she took me to the facial room where soft music was playing and I felt like i was in Hawaii the ocean sounds were so relaxing! She gave me an amazing facial with her Dermalogica products and the message was heavenly, I would recommend this place to anybody thank you Dorina for your great service,see you soon!
