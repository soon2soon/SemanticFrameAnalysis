Had some friends stay here visiting me from out of town and so we booked a big party room... it ended up being so fun! Great location for going out, right at the famous 6 corners area. Was really easy to meet people here and just had the right atmosphere. Keep in mind it is a hostel, so you have to share bathrooms and it's sort of clean up after yourself, but yeah... overall clean. I love the big windows too... very lofty.
