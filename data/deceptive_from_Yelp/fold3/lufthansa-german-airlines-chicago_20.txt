I chose to fly Lufthansa because of all the great reviews I read on this site, however, I unfortunately had a very POOR experience with Lufthansa when I recently flew from NC to Munich to Venice, Italy and returned Venice to Frankfurt to O'Hare. The service from the flight attendants as well as the ticket counter was the worst I have ever experienced.  I've had better service with Southwest!!!  These folks were extremely rude, condescending, and inconsiderate. Im giving Lufthansa1 Star for safely and timely flight to and from Venice, Italy.  They definitely did their job well in that respect.  However, the next time I fly to Europe, I will NOT use Lufthansa Airlines ever again!!!!!
