"HOW I GOT SCABIES"/"BYOS - BRING YOUR OWN SHEETS" I stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel on MagMile from August 30th to Sept 1st. That's right, just one night. From a Sunday to a Monday. We arrive at 4PM, and at the concierge desk they tell us that our room isn't "ready" yet. How convenient. So, we check in our bags to the bag boys, though I don't feel comfortable putting my purse with my iPad in their hands so we have to walk all the way back to the car. And when will the room be ready? They don't know. "30 minutes" they say, though it may take longer. Anyways, what an inconvenience for us since we were only staying 1 night. Turns out, these housekeepers were so behind, one of them must have just said "Fuck it!" when it came to washing the sheets! The next morning, I woke up with little bumps and a redness between my 3rd and 4th toe on the left foot. It mildly itched but I thought, maybe a spider got to me? Anyway, it itched off and on for a few weeks, and, after 6 weeks, I noticed it didn't go away. It itched more and more, at night. Now, this past weekend it was exactly 8 weeks later, and I have full-blown scabies. It itched so bad, and now it has spread to both feet, both ankles (inside and outside), both wrists, and on my hands. Doc has prescribed a lotion and antibiotics. Hopefully, the skin under my toes will grow back soon because scabies does that, it makes the skin between underneath the digits die. I've never had any type of parasite before. I certainly wasn't thinking about any type of parasite from the big city, and the Intercontinental Hotel! I've never even had lice, ticks, worms, etc. Now I have probably hundreds of scabies living under my skin as I write this. DISGUSTING. I am praying that this hasn't spread to my family! Now I have to do laundry everyday at the laundromat for a week or more, while rubbing lotion on myself from head to toe (literally) since some ASSHOLE couldn't do her fucking job and change the sheets ONCE.
