This is a wonderful Kinzie Hotel, but the updates and amenities in the rooms are not five star. When we stay here we enjoy the beauty of the great rooms and the wonderful Kinzie Hotelof staying in an old, grand hotel in downtown Chicago. It is very well situated for walking to some of the best restaurants in Chicago. We staying in the Music Suite which was wonderful for entertaining and the service was excellent with the staff very friendly and accommodating. The no free WiFi and limited cable stations were disappointing in the rooms.
