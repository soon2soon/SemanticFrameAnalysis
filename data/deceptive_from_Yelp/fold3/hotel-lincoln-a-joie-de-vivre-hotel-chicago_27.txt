We stayed in one of the lake-view junior suites for our honeymoon. We loved the location and the atmosphere of the suite and the hotel in general. The entire staff was welcoming and helpful. The breakfast buffet was included with our stay; while a far cry from the incredible Sunday Brunches Hotel Lincoln once served, it was a pleasant start to each day. If I have one complaint, it would be on the housekeeping side. It's sad to see such a beautiful room tarnished by mold and mildew in the stand-up shower and a thick accumulation of dust around and under the furniture.
