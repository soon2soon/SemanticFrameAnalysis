Let me begin this review by stating that the food was delicious. However, after our experience last night I am unable to Â review this restaurant based solely on its quality of food. Nothing, in my opinion and at my age, is worth waiting for two hours. We put our names on the list at 7:30, were told the wait was 1-1.5 hours and were seated a solid two hours later. By that point, despite several drinks, we were all cranky and beyond hungry. Once seated, they offer nothing in the way of noshing--no bread service for gluten eaters, no olives for gluten-free peeps, nothing! For those with food allergies/intolerances, beware! Our server was super snarky with me when I told him about my need to avoid gluten and dairy. He suggested two dishes that I could eat on the entire menu because, in his words, "we don't want to deconstruct a dish and sacrifice flavor." Bah! Insensitive? I think so. When the food arrived at 10:30 it was definitely yummy. I give the restaurant props for good-tasting food. But, no reservations, a wait much longer than expected, and an inflexible kitchen (or maybe just server) for those with food allergies are reasons why, no matter how good the food may taste, I'll never return to this restaurant.
