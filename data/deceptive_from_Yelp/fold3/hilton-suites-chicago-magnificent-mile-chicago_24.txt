If we were to use one word to describe this hotel, it would be: PREFECTION!!!!!! We are loyal Hilton members and have to say this is probably the best OVERALL hotel we've stayed at in a major city. The front desk were exceptional always willing to help with any request. Housekeeping was excellent keeping our room cleaned. We didn't eat at the restaurant downstairs, but seemed to be packed and looked good from the see through kitchen window. The LOCATION of this hotel is superb, right next to the Hancock building and blocks away from a bus that takes you pretty much anywhere around Chicago's hotspots. The executive lounge was also a great hit, breakfast was yummy and always fresh, the afternoon appetizers were tasty too. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE WHO DECIDES TO STAY IN CHICAGO. OUTSTANDING LOCATION, SERVICE, AND ROOMS.
