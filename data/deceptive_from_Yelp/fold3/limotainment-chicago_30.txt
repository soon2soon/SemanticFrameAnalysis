Wish there was a 6th star!! Booked Limotainment as part of my wedding celebration.  We had myself, my wife, and 14 bridal party members - and it was legitimately a party on wheels for 3+ hours.  Mike Yonk did a top-notch job with everything - from the music selection (IPod compatible, champagne & beer (both in coolers), glasses, light show inside, A/C on a hot July day, and on and on.   Mike was great and very easy to work with.  He made sure that all our details and wishes were personally carried out.  This is why I would recommend this bus/company without reservation - for whatever type of event - corporate, wedding, party, etc., you will not have to worry about the atmosphere of the bus - because Mike helps craft it along with you.
