I booked a 20-room block at the Hyatt for the night before and of my wedding. It was an unmitigated disaster. They delivered the guest bags 36 hours late - meaning no out of town guests had a map of the weekend events - and only after three additional asks. When my husband and I arrived, they had cancelled our reservation. They gave us a new room but provided a key that didn't work. After two staff attempts to open the door, the security guard did so only to find other people sleeping in the room we were assigned. The hotel took so long to try and fix the problem (we sat in the hall in our gown and tux for 40 minutes) that two of our wedding guests gave up their room, doubled up with friends, and gave us their room so we would have somewhere to sleep. If you're looking for a place to accommodate your guests, look elsewhere.
