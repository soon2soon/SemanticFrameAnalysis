Loved the hotel.  Many extras.  Had a King Suite and the suite was very large.  A sitting area with a kitchenette (microwave, sink, refrigerator) TV, chair, and sofa bed as well as the regular bedroom area. I would have given 5 stars except for no in room coffee maker in the kitchenette, snow not removed from the sidewalks in front of the hotel ,and the parking (did not like walking from the garage to the hotel at night). Overall, a great hotel with very friendly staff
