I contacted Loyalty Limo a few weeks before my sister's bachelorette party in Chicago. The entire process could not have been easier - I confirmed pricing via the chat feature on their website, then followed up a couple days later to book. I spoke to Vince each time - he was very professional and answered all of my questions. Everything was outlined completely in the agreement he sent to me. Pricing was affordable and even included two bottles of champagne & beer! I highly recommend Loyalty Limo, and would use them again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Vince!
