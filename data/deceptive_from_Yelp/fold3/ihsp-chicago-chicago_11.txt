Me and 4 friends we were staying at this hostellast weekend  and We had the worst experience in our life and my advice is: Stay away from this place!!! It is very disorganized when we checked in (in the morning period) they did not have any towel for us. At NIGHT we were getting ready to go out, we asked for towels and to our surprise THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY TOWEL TO US YET, we had to wait almost an hour and when we got the towels it was WET and USED, USED smelly, I had to dry with sheet full of hair. DETAILS we needed 5 towels and they gave only 3 towels ( USED). We were in 5 and the room had only 4 beds, I had to sleep to another room (no problem) but when i got to the room (just to sleep) the bed was a mess!! NO SHEET, and NO pillow. I made a room reservation and i did not even had a bed for me. I PAID FOR THAT!!!!! The NEXT DAY when my friends and I asked for towels guess what,..  no towels!!!!!! This is ridiculous thousand times ridiculous!!!!! Very disorganized. I did my check out on Saturday and I forgot my sandals in the room but  my friend was still staying at the hostel, I thought it would not have any problem, but to my surprise the girl from front desck did not  let her enter the room to get my sandals!! I would like to get feedback from someone responsible to know:  Why my friend could not get my sandals??????? Thank you Nadia I will wait for the answer. nadiamancilha@hotmail.com
