This could be probably be the worst hotel I've ever experienced.  There is no way this place should receive 1 star let alone 4 stars.  First off, the rooms are so small that you literally cannot move in them.  I booked on Priceline and  called ahead and was told I could have two beds.  We get here and they have no rooms with two beds.  We are four guys in this tiny little joke of a room with two in the bed and two on the floor.  The staff was rude to us and refused to even compensate us in even the smallest way for our troubles.  This supposed great hotel has only one tiny plastic cup in the bathroom.  The bathroom also has no exhaust fan and when you use the facilities the room literally stinks for an hour. I can't recommend enough to stay away from this place.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Worst hotel I've ever been to in Chicago.
