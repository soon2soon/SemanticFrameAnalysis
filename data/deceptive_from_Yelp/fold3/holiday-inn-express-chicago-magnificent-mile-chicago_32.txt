Despite the negative reviews I've read about this hotel, I would recommend this place to ANYBODY! I visited Chicago for the first time this past February and I loved it. Yes the room was small, but the decor was nice, the bed was nice and comfortable and then on top of that you have FREE wifi and a FREE breakfast. With that part of Chicago being moderately pricey, it's good to be able to save a few bucks here and there. I will definitely be staying there my next visit. To get a really good deal, use Hotwire.com. I paid 50 bucks a night!
