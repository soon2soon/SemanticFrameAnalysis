Stayed at the Palomar for 3 nights.  Let me say, I didn't want to leave.  This was my first time staying at a hotel  in Chicago; I always stayed with family since I was a kid.  Once I open the door to my room, and say the windows  with the lake, and the building surrounding  the Chicago River, I felt like a tourist for the first time in Chicago.  I wanted to do everything, and see everything that there was to do. The service was top notch.  Valet attendants were very nice, and remembered me every time i came down stairs for my car.  It does take a while for them to bring your car around, so call down to the front desk before you leave your room, and they will have the car waiting. The little touches that this hotel did, is what made my stay exceptional.  Dog bowls with treat and water for the dogs.  Coffee and tea in the AM. Water in the afternoon, and wine in the evening.  Slippers, robes, and extra pillows in the closet.  I forgot about the umbrella, which came in handy a few nights when i poured down for about 20 mins.   I will definitely say here again.
