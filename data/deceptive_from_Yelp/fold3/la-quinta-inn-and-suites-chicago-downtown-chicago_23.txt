When ever I travel I always use LA Quinta motels.  I'm a rewards member plus they are always pet friendly so you can bring your furry friends.  So it was no surprise that we stayed here while on vacation.  The prices are affordable especially for rewards members,  the beds are always comfortable, the rooms are big and have refrigerator and microwaves in them and the breakfast is fantastic here.  Let's not forget about free Wi-Fi. The front desk made sure that they grouped all of our rooms together which was awesome.  We never had an issue with a rude person and we were there for 4 nights.  All in all great stay and we will be going back here over the summer on our next family trip.
