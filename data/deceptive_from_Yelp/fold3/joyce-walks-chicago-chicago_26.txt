My friends and I participated in a Joyce Walks tour of the Maxwell Street area and  found it to be extremely interesting and educational, without being "classroomy".  The walk through today'a market was fun, and Joyce's thorough knowledge of the subject matter is evident.  Her descriptions helped us to visualize the Maxwell Street market and surrounding area of the city as it really was back in "the day".
