We held our wedding reception here on September 19, 2014.  It was absolutely amazing.  The staff are wonderful.  They were attentive and friendly throughout the entire wedding process.  Our guests raved about the food and the service.  The catering manager, Janet Donovan is a sweetheart!  She made me feel like I was the only wedding she had on her plate.  She responded quickly and thoroughly to all our emails and phone calls.  The city view you get from the ballroom is breathtaking.  I would highly recommend them is you are looking for a downtown location without breaking the bank as the the pricing is very reasonable.  Thanks Janet and the HICMP staff for giving us a day to happily remember!
