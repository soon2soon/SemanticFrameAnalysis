Exactly what you'd expect. Pull in, get ticket from kiosk, park somewhere, shuttle pulls up next to your car (nearly immediately after you arrive), driver loads your bags, drives you to airport at your airlines ticketing door, driver unloads your bags. Upon return, acquire your luggage, go to "parking" pickup island (or call them if after hours), shuttle driver loads your bags, drives you to your car, unloads your bags, you drive your car to kiosk and pay and you're on your way. We had parked for 2 weeks so the bill was high but the attendant immediately discounted the total when we were surprised! Will definitely use them again.
