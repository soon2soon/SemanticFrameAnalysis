So recently my wife and I decided to book a room at the Sax with a groupon and were thoroughly surprised when staying, not in a good way! The hotel is going through renovations and the hallways are basically ripped apart from the ceilings down. It's supposed to be a glamorous hotel, not so glamorous when you're walking and wondering if something is going to fall on your head. The heat in room did not work in the middle of December in CHICAGO. aside from the room being clean, nothing else stood out about this place; Cheap towels that felt like razor blades (obviously the hotel doesn't use fabric softener), cheap toiletries and lack there of as well, horrible bedding that felt like cardboard and a bed from hell, half of the channels on the tv did not work, no free wi-fi, not even complimentary bottle water and/or coffee.                The room was poorly insulated and by that I mean you could hear everything from guests laughing in the hallway, the toilet flushing above us, boats on the river, and even traffic EIGHT floors above ground level. There is no pool in the hotel and for the price per night one should expect more bang for your buck.     My wife and I have stayed at the Embassy Suites in Streeterville in the past and were pleasantly surprised with our stay there. Next time we'll consider going back to Embassy or even trying out the Penninsula for a little more moola.
