The hotel is clean, attractive and in a great area of Chicago for tourists.  The "front staff" are polite and professional.  Unfortunately, we encountered one minor issue with hotel policies that management failed to post in rooms or in any literature received at check-in.  A simple and honest inquiry resulted in a barrage of insults, harassment and unwarranted charges added to our bill.  Management refused to professionally address the matter, failed to return our phone calls--even after promising to do so-- and treated customers, who had paid in full up front, spent hundreds of dollars patronizing the hotel amenities, etc., like garbage.  Several Management reps who we spoke to outright lied over and over when we, the customers, pointed out the discrepancies. Two witnesses observed the obvious dishonesty and inability by hotel management to address the pardonable matter with any honesty or or scruples.  It's a shame that Hyatt allows such inept, tactless, abrasive, dishonest people lacking any customer service skills to manage their beautiful hotel.  Our experience with Hyatt management won't soon be forgotten and have no future plans to stay at Hyatt Chicago or any other Hyatt facility. Kelly is the name of the manager at this specific location who made every attempt to ruin our otherwise perfect vacation in the windy city.  Close, but no cigar Kelly.
