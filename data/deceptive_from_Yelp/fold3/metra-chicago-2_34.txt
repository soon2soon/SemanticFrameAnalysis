I highly suggest to avoid this train as much as possible.  Sadly, they have a monopoly around chicagoland, basically.  So they can charge whatever they want.  Their prices are already overpriced and as of next month they're increasing their prices 30%.  The employees are extremely rude whether they work on the train or selling tickets in the station.  None of the bathrooms have working faucets.
