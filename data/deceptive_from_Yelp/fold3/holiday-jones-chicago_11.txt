so far beyond expectations on every level.  Tiny rooms that find a way to comfort a weary traveler, convenient to train to downtown, in hip neighborhood.  You get your own theme music in the lobby from your geographic origin.  Hard to find more genuine hospitality and thought out service, at any price. Ok, maybe not the ACE, but give them a few months figuring out the smallest details and you will not be staying here, just reading about it in the Times review section. the bad; low quantities of coffee in the morning, some unfinished drywall in the basement. Coffee is cured by the famous Filter coffee in stuber distance and a st arbucks next door- AND, they are working to get local roaster service.
