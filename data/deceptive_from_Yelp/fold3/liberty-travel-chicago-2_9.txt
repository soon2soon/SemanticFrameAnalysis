I worked with Sara in the LaSalle & Jackson branch of Liberty to plan my honeymoon. My husband and I had an idea of where we wanted to go (Greece), but we were unsure if a scheduled tour or travelling on our own would be best. Sara gave us a lot of options and helped us decide that travelling on our own would be best for where we wanted to go in Greece. She listened to what we wanted and delivered with great hotels and day tours. Before we even got home we started thinking of ideas for our next trip, that we'll definitely book through Sara.
