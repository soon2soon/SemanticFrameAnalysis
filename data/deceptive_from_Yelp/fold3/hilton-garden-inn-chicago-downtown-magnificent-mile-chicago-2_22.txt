The rooms where nice. But I was charged 200$ extra for a one night stay. At check out they removed it to later put back on plus another 100 making it 300$ on top of 200 which was supposed to be the total. When asked was told it was a new policy. Upon reading the sheet said there would be a 50$ Â hold per night incase of damages. Instead I was charged 300 extra. A 200 dollar 2 night stay turned into 700bucks.
