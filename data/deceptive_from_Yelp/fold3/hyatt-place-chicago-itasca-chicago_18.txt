So I will be honest that we don't usually stay in super nice hotels (we are the budget-y) types, but this hotel was blocked for a wedding and we wanted to use the shuttle. Plus, really, it was pretty affordable! Ok so given that, I still have to say that this is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. They gave us a tour which made us feel special, the room was really nice and updated, and the breakfast was awesome (we get so tired of the free breakfasts from most hotels that include just like three carb options, but here there were egg sandwiches, yogurt, plus the carbs like pancakes!) There was one problem while we were there, a weird beeping noise at night that woke us up and we couldn't locate, but the hotel sent us a personal email stating that they were looking into the source of the problem. I was impressed by their service.
