Had a fantastic stay at the Hotel Palomar recently on a two-night stay. This follows two prior stays in previous months. On each occasion, I have been equally impressed with the hotel, and staff. I stayed in the King Spa Premier room - very spacious, clean, bright, and bathrooms are a highlight with Etro bath products and deep, large soaking whirlpool tubs. Location is perfect - very easy to reach by train from the airport (with Grand station one block away) and easy walking distance to several top restaurants, bars and Michigan Ave. Staff - from the folks welcoming guests at the front, to the front desk staff, to the concierges (Mark and Bobby are very knowledgeable, friendly and patient to answer any questions), the entire experience is not to be missed. Five stars are earned - especially when considering the hotels in the comparable price category....
