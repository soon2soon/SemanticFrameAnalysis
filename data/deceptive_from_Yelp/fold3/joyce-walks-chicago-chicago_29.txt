Joyce was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Her expertise is shared in a down-to-earth manner, that shows her genuine love for history and the neighborhoods.  She gave me and my girlfriend plenty of pro advice for restaurants and stores to visit in Chinatown. Best of all, we will be able to go back to Chinatown and feel confident thanks to Joyce.
