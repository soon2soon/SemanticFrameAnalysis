On 6/29/12 my husband and I enjoyed two walking tours with Paula.  In the a.m. we did the architectural tour of the Loop; and, in the afternoon, State Street.  Paula is a great tour guide, very friendly, knowledgeable, and interesting.  Her enthusiasm for all things Chicago is contagious, and we thoroughly enjoyed the day.  She made every moment count, and never lost a beat with her humor and often detailed information.  Even a downpour before the first tour ended did not deter our group of 4.   Without hesitation, I would recommend tours with Joyce Walks Chicago.
