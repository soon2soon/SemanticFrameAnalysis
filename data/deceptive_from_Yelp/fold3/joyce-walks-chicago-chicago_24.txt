I brought a group of 32 Spanish students and we were given a fantastic tour of Lincoln Park and Old Town. Joyce and her guides were well-informed and articulate. We were given historical explanations about multiple sites along the personalized tour route that was led at a relaxed pace. The guides interacted with the students sharing their anecdotes about the neighborhoods; Â answering questions; and making recommendations - Joyce took extra time after the tour to show a group of them where to find the best lunches in the area. It was an entertaining and instructive morning that made the trip to Chicago all the more memorable for the participants. As a participant and the trip organizer for the group, I can't recommend Joyce highly enough. Paul F.
