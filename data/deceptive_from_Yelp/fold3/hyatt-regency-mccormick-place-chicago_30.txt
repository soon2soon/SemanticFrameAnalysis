Typical great Hyatt service and professionalism.  Only complain is the rooms were very small and motel like and not what I expected from a Hyatt.  Food was outstanding just disappointed in the size and decor of the room for the price.  I would stay there again if I had a convention at McCormick Place b/c it is right next door or if I was going to a Bears game becuase it is very close to Soldier Field.
