This is a wonderful airline.  I have been on may.  This by far is the best one I have been on in a while.  The staff everywhere is so so friendly.  They give you a whole can of Coke and a good size snack with many to choose from.  I couldn't believe it the first time I was on one of their flight and you could watch regular TV.  Yes they have satellite TV.  No more having to drag 2 DVD players for the kids or a bag of movies that just get lost.  My husband and I flew to Boston with 2 kids and all we had to bring were headphones and my purse.  Truly amazing.  The only con I can think of is that they don't fly everywhere.  We wouldn't look any further than Jet Blue if they flew everywhere we wanted to go. On top of the great experience on board the flight we also could check our bags without being charged!!!  If jet blue flew everywhere they would put the rest out of business that's for sure.  Oh ya the leg room was twice as much as the rest of the airlines.Oh so very very very impressed!!!!
