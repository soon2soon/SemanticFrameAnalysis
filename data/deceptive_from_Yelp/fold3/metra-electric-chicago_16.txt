Been riding the train for a few years now. I really like it so yeah... Does anyone know why sometimes the conductors switch with other conductors on the train and they are still working on the same train just at a different section? Like for a few months they will be at the front of the train then switch w/the other conductor for like 9 weeks and come back? let me know.
