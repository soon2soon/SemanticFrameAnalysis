Love this place! Along with unbeatable rates, IHSP Chicago offers a safe, clean, and friendly environment for young people traveling in Chicago. The staff go above and beyond to ensure a comfortable, fun stay and are knowledgeable about the area. From finding a place to eat to a way to spend a rainy day and how to get there and back, they can help. I have returned several times and recommend IHSP to anyone seeking an affordable way to stay in an eccentric, beloved neighborhood in the windy city.
