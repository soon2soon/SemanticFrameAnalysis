Female desk clerk resists work.  When asked to lookup something, pretends to be nice and then whigs out and screams.  Satanic server girls who had no problem telling me so.  Get these girls on meds.  Pronto.  Not a good place to do business in.  Girls more concerned with "other" things then being helpful and friendly.  May want to get security's number before going.  May want to check out the Hyatt McCormick if you  insist on staying at the Hyatt.  They have very helpful, friendly staff.
