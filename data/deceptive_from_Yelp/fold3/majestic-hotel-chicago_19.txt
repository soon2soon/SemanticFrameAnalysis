Stayed here 30th Jan - 3rd Feb 2014. Beautiful hotel in the middle of downtown Chicago. TV show castle was being filmed at the time of our stay so we also watched some filming for that. Parking is $40 for 24hours. We parked in the Pershing square car park which is on Olive street outside the hotel for $16 all day and overnight.
