Me and my wife was here on a business trip for two days, I would never stay here again. The service was horrible, my wife ordered room service while I was in meetings it took over an hr to be delivered and she said the food was cold and nasty she ate three bites and was finished. After a long night we decided to go up to our room and relax and right now we're laying here waiting for there TV to come back on. I don't know if they didn't pay the bill or what but I've stayed at cheaper hotels with a lot better rooms and service. We're here with over 100 people and 70% of us our very very unhappy. We will never nor will our company come here or book anything again. Last thing don't hire workers that's going to whistle at girls out front of the hotel just trash. UPDATE YOUR HOTEL. TRASH!!!
