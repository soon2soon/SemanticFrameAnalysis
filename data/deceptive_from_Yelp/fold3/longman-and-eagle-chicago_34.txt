L&E is the jam. Great food, great atmosphere and the best cocktails in town. If you love meat, whiskey and a room packed with stylish people this is the place for you. I do love the L&E but will admit the long waits for dinner/brunch and high levels of noise during dinner take my review down just a notch. I agree with Ben S. on their biggest problem being their success. They have an issue with those things as well as holier than thou attitudes from some of the servers. This seems to happen when success goes to peoples heads. They are very pleased with themselves, but do you blame them? They have a great thing going on. Overall I fully dig this place and go often. It IS worth the wait if you have the patience.
