Stayed last weekend for 3 nights to celebrate a friends 40th birthday! Not only was it a great deal, and the LOCATION WAS PERFECT, close to all the hot spots in downtown. BUT, From the time we got to the front door Rafi the doorman was so helpful & friendly. We were able to check in early and drop off our suitcases even though or room wasn't ready! Meg the front desk clerk was so pleasant and accommodating. Rafi directed us to a wonderful lunch spot while we were waiting for our room. He gave us so much information and helpful hints to do while on vacation. Â  The complimentary happy hour was so nice. Go to mingle with other hotel guests and unwind. Continental breakfast was nothing like I have seen at any other hotel. They put out such a spread and there was plenty of options. The best part is that it is served on every floor outside the elevator. It was so great not having to go down to a lobby or restaurant like most other hotels. They even include trays in every room. One of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in. The entire staff is so friendly and accommodating no matter what time of the day. I can't wait to come back here. Love this place.
