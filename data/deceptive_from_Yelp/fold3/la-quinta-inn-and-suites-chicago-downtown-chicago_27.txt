It was my first time ever in Chicago and the staff was very helpful in directions and sharing valuable information on getting a taxi or public transportation. The suite I was in was tidy and very well spaces. The breakfast needed better selections but over all I had a wonderful stay! The restroom was very cleand and I was very grateful for that!
