The worst $425 stay I've had. I was booked at this hotel for a trip. Plans changed and I called to cancel the reservation the day before check-in. The woman on the phone kindly informed me that as I was calling technically only 23 hours ahead, instead of 24, there was nothing they could do and I would be billed the entire $425. I asked if there was anything more reasonable they could do, such as charge a 25% cancellation fee. Nope. While I understand hotels need cancellation policies, charging $425 (must be their highest rate!) due to a 1 hour late notice seems unreasonable.
