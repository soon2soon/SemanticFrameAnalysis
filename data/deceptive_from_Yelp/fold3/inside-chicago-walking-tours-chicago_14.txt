I've been downtown many times but I never took the time to learn about the history of the buildings. The architecture walking tour was fun and interesting! Our tour guide, Hillary, was very knowledgeable and clearly did tons of research to make sure all the facts are legit! She made the tour fun and pointed out so many things that you would never notice by just walking past a building.
