The one star is for the location on Michigan Ave. The hotel is old and is in need of an upgrade. The lampshades were puckered and torn, the wall was chipped, and the room was tiny. They charged $65 for parking and $50 for a cot. The hotel seems to penny and dime its customers and not provide service! The staff were horrid....terribly condescending and RUDE. They absolutely behave as if this hotel it the Ritz (which let me assure you it is NOT!). No one provided information on where to pick up valet parked vehicles nor where to find the pool or work-out room. Lastly, they have no restroom available on the first floor for guests! You need to trudge up to your room or wander around on the 2nd floor to find a bathroom. INSANITY!!!!! How this hotel keeps a 4.5 star rating is beyond me! It is truly more like a 3 - 3.5 star hotel.
