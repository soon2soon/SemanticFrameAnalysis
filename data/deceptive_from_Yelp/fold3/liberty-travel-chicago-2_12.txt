Alison was our travel agent and we had such a blast on our trip to Mexico. She made sure our insanely large group of girls didn't have to worry about any single detail for my friend's bachelorette getaway. She provided answers to all our questions and kept us in the loop every step of the way leading up to the trip. This was my first time going through a travel agent and I was thrilled about the outcome. Thanks, Alison for helping us build cherished memories with our bride-to-be. Will definitely be contacting her again!
