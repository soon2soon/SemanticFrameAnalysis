Yes Metra's cars are more comfortable than CTA cars, but the trains are not always on time and the conductors can be rude. Service was better back in the day when ticket prices were cheap and service was friendlier. The train does have bathrooms, but I wouldn't step inside them as they are super dirty. Hovering over the toilet will probably get you some kind of disease. Metra has also been subject to investigations involving scams and schemes against riders. (local news media) 1. ex-CEO Pagano committed suicide after stealing millions from the company. 2. Employees were told to stamp incorrect dates on backs of tickets to make them last only a few weeks instead of being valid for a year. and many more controversies..
