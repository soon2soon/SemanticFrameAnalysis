These guys are great.  After a really bad experience at Midway EZ Parking, they are a breath of fresh air.  Unfortunately you wouldn't know that about Midway EZ Parking on yelp.  They somehow got most of their bad reviews "filtered".  Read them if you like.  Just enter the passwords.  Midway Park Ride and Fly is the way to go!  Thanks fellas/ Anyway, these guys get my business now.  It's worth the couple of extra bucks for friendly service and faster service.  They are not rude like the Father and Son team at Midway EZ Parking.
