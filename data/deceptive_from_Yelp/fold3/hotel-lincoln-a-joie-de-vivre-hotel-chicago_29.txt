I was there for a convention. The hotel was beautiful, new style furnishings etc. Unfortunately there were many steps and staircases to get from one conference room to the other which was uncomfortable for my not so young knees. The staff were helpful and the ambiance lovely. Location to high end shopping was great, an!d also to restaurants. I would visit again
