I'm still patting myself on the back for booking this place for my Chicago vacation. It is in the heart of downtown so everything you need is within reach. Restaurants, pharmacies, train stations, are all right there. As far as the accommodations this place is completely renovated so the rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. Oh and the staff couldn't be any cuter! Everyone was so helpful, and attentive, you would have thought we were in the south because we had such great hospitality. It goes without saying I will visit Chicago again, and I will be staying at this hotel!!!!
