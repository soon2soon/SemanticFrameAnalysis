This is a fine hotel with excellent rooms. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are eloquent. There are plenty of big soft towels. On the eighth floor there is a gym with a running track and spa that is better than any of the other hotels where I have stayed. The hot tubs are hot and powerful. I can't say enough about the staff. They are all very helpful in every respect. One of the maids told me that she had worked there over 30 years. Depending on the time of the year you stay there, this hotel can be a bit pricy, but worth it when compared to big city, downtown hotels.
