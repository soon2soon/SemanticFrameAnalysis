The best! Incredibly inexpensive, super clean, nice location, street parking, free wifi, free breakfast, friendly staff. Who could ask for more? Stayed in a 4-person room with bathroom in the hall. Although the place seemed pretty full, I never had to wait for the bathroom. The other people in my room err enter national travelers, two young women from Germany and another from China, all very nice, very courteous. The whole facility smelled so clean, in the best possible way. No chemicals, just clean. Breakfast of fresh bagels, spreads and assorted cereals works for me. Staff was friendly and went out of its way to be helpful. Neighborhood felt safe, facility secure with unmarked keycards. Plenty of on-street parking, though you have to read the signs. Easy access to public transportation, maybe 1/2 hour to the center of town.
