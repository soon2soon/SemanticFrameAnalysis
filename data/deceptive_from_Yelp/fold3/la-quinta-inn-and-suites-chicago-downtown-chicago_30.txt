(First and foremost I've done my fair share of traveling around the world lol so I have experience in hotels, motels, inns..etc.) After looking for a hotel in Chicago on numerous sites, I booked a room at the Raddison. I ended up thinking 'Why am I spending so much money for one weekend when i'm sure I can find better?' and I did. Out of nowhere I came across La Quinta Inn. I cancelled my reservation right away & booked a room, BEST CHOICE EVER. This hotel honestly does not compare to any other in the city. BEST prices, free hot breakfast, pool, hot tub, CLEAN, comfortable, & extremely polite & helpful staff. One more bonus for me is that I wasn't looking at spending so much on 'Incidental Fees' which 90% of hotels have, which is just incase you use valet, room service, damages..etc. I didn't want to spend an additional $75-$150 a night with other hotels, but La Quinta has NO HIDDEN FEES OR CHARGES. So I could use my money touring the city instead :) I have no complaints about this hotel except that I did not stay longer (which I was debating upon checkout lol!) Definitely going back in a couple of months.
