My husband and I took "The World Within" tour last week, and learned so much from Hillary. She showed us little nooks and crannies of fascinating buildings that most people - tourists and people who live and work in Chicago - walk pass every day.   She  took us into a secret room in a popular hotel where huge names in entertainment have relaxed before a show - and showed us how Chicago's history has shaped its architecture. I only wish we'd had more time on our trip to take other tours with this company Engaging, fun and very informative!
