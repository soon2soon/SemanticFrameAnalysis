A great boutique-feeling hotel in downtown Chicago.  The room was pretty spacious and the bed was quite comfortable.  Modern and upscale decor.  I liked the flat-screen HD TV, especially since I couldn't score tixs to the Cubs playoff game. The bar, Crimson, serves up a great martini.  It is a cool place to meet and greet. I'm going back there.  Front desk, valet, bell-man, and cleaning services were top-flight.  Plus it was nice that they had 3 computers avail in the lobby to check email or to print boarding passes.
