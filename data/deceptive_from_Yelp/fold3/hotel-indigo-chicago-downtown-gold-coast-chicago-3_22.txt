Rooms are to small, and smell musty. They have old Tv's where you can barely see the screen.  If you are claustrophobic, you will feel it walking down the narrow hallways.  Our room was way at the end of the hall around the bend two other rooms, but only room for one person to open there door at one time that's how small the entryway is.  As  Travel agent would not recommend this hotel to anyone
