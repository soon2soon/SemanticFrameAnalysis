I have been on the Limotainment limo bus and was impressed with the interior capacity and quality.  We had more people show up than expected, but due to the size we all fit easily.  The driver was on time, kind and very funny.  The event was great and we got there drunk.  I have already booked another event with Limotainment limo bus and looking forward to it.
