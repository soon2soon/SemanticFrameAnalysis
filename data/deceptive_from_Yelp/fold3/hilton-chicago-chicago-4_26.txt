Will definitely not stay again. I recently stayed at this Hilton location for the weekend for the Blackhawks convention. While the rest of the hotel lobbies and ball rooms were nice, the room was a disaster. I was on the 17th floor and for the price I paid for the room it was not worth it at all. The room was dirty from the previous visitors and while trying to look for an outlet I took a look under the bed only to find pretzels and M&M's still under there from only god knows when. The ceilings were falling apart on this floor and the building just seems to need a major renovation. The bathroom was quite dirty as well around the tub and the tray that holds the soap as well. Would not recommend.
