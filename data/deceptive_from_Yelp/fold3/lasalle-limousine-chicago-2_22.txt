If I could rate this no stars, I would!  This place is a joke!  I was part of a bachelorette party that was dumped out at a gas station on North Ave and Ashland.  11 women total!  As soon as we got into the limo, things were bad.  There was no ice and sodas as promised.  When we asked for an auxillary plug to play our own music, the driver told us that he thought someone had took it but he wasnt sure.  We looked all around for it.  We asked him to buy one since he was stopping at the nearby Walgreens to purchase the soda and ice that was supposed to already be there.  He then told us the back radio didn't work and he would turn up the front radio.  Which sounded horrible!  I asked him to roll up the privacy window and he told me it was broken. WHAT A JOKE! Who conducts business like this?!  Then on our way to our final location he pulls over and tells us our time is up. SERIOUSLY?!  ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD??  We were about 25 miles from our destination and he refused to go any further unless we paid him an additional $150 plus gratuity!!!  SERIOUSLY?!  We told him we would pay that once he took us to our destination, we all thought he agreed.  Next thing you know, he pulls over at a gas station and leaves all of us.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU LITERALLY WANT TO BE DRIVEN IN A DUMP AND THEN DUMPED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD!!!
