I was very disappointed that I made a reservation one month in advance and upon arrival, was told the lot was full. As Jerry Seinfeld once said, "You know how to TAKE the reservation, you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation." Alas, the attendant told me to drive to another company's lot that was 1 mile further from Midway Airport. I, however, parked at Midway and it was worth the extra $3 per day. Safe travels.
