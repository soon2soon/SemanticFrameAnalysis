The Chinatown tour was filled with great information. Joyce has a fun, easy-going manner and warm enthusiasm for her work. She also respects this area and the people who live there. We got a very good feel of the people, the history and the commerce in this part of Chicago, and feel more connected to it now that we have had this introduction from Joyce. It was a small group and we never felt rushed - it was a delightful, relaxing way to tour the neighborhood. Would definitely recommended this to others.
