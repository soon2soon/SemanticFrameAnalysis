My wife and I use this company every time we fly out of Midway.  There is never a problem from parking the car to final pick-up from airport.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I honestly would not park anywhere else.  In addition, there is great comfort knowing the car is safe.  It is always one less thing to worry about before stepping on a plane. Keep the yellow card you are given when you park.  It has on it the space number.  Without it the driver still helps you locate the car but it takes a lot longer then if you have the card ready to give him.
