We spent our 35th Wedding Anniversary here and enjoyed our hotel stay. The front desk staff went above and beyond making our check in fast and our stay Â wonderful.The bathroom was spotless and had a tub and shower both. We had to paid for parking, but the service getting our car was fast and friendly. This hotel is well worth checking into, we would stay here again on our next visit to Chicago.
