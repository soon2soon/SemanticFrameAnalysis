The Hotel Palomar... what an experience! I wanted to do something fabulous for myself on my birthday, but my husband beat me to it. We live in Waukegan, so it's a bit of a drive to get to the city, but that's okay. Call it a staycation. When I saw this building, I thought wow, very sleek. Since it was my birthday, they upgraded our suite and we had a Jacuzzi tub in the room. I told hubby to bring on the wine cuz we are soaking in that baby tonight! ... ahem... needless to say, we had a lot of fun, great night. I was a happy girl for my birthday! Highly recommend the Palomar to anyone and everyone.
