I have stayed here twice, once for business and once with the family. Pros:  Perfect location for seeing the sites of Chicago, you can walk, transit or  taxi anywhere.  Big rooms, nice TV, very comfortable beds.  Good service at the front desk, but sometimes it takes them a while because of lines.  Free WiFi.  Reasonable price for location and quality. Cons:  Lobby area can seem cramped and elevators slow when busy.  There can be a lot of street noise.  They provide earplugs on the bed stands,annoying, but not horrible.  Their breakfast is so/so.  They do have hot items, but they are pre-made and not cooked on site.  Tastes fake.  I stick with fruit, granola, yogurt, etc.  Try to avoid bringing a car.  It is $50+ per night parking and you don't need a car at this location. Will certainly be back.  Quality, location and rate cannot be beat.
