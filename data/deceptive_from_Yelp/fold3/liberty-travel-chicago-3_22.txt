A retail storefront that isn't open on Sundays? Really? In the 21st century, with the Internet and numerous other travel agent options, and you're weekend hours are gimped like a Chic-Fil-A? BTW, I noticed that this place has a lot of reviews that are "filtered" many of which are negative. What gives?
