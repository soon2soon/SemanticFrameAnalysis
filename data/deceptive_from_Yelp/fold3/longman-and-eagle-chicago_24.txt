Went to brunch on Saturday.  Hubby wanted to go due to the rave reviews.  Food was extremely salty and out of proportion.  (Not sure where the kitchen staff was trained.  Perhaps they need a refresher course.)  Too expensive.  Wait staff rude, not attentive (her name was Erin) and didn't know much about the menu or the beer selections.  Very disappointed.  Over-rated and too expensive.  Won't be going back.  Won't recommend to anyone (except to stay away).  How did they get such good ratings?  It makes one wonder.  Wanted to tell the owner, who dropped by the table to see how things were going, but felt it would probably fall on dead ears.  Go elsewhere with your money.  Let the hipsters who know nothing about good food have this place.
