We have used Loyalty Limo services last Friday 10/11 for a bachelorette party. The owner Vince was very pleasing and agreed to all our requests regarding change of pick-up times, red carpet and other services. He arranged everything within a day's notice. Â Our Chauffer was on time, greeted us with a smile and very accommodating. Even though we booked the Limo only for a drop off, the Chauffer ensured we enjoyed some cruise time before the drop-off. I would reccommend Loyalty Limo with complete trust!!
