I'd never stayed at a hostel before but was feeling a little adventurous and wanted to keep some extra cash. Having grown up in a big house with a huge family (6 kids), I didn't mind that there were other people in the same space or that everyone had to share. I guess this is just the kind of accommodation that isn't for everyone. It was very clean and well-kept, and the free breakfast was an awesome touch. I hate doing dishes, but figured it was the least I could do after a decent breakfast, right? All in all, I had a lot of fun meeting strangers and socializing, and was happy to see that everyone was courteous and respectful. The staff was wonderful and extremely knowledgeable about the neighborhood and where to go to find whatever it is you're looking for. I would definitely stay here again, whether I didn't have the extra cash or not - it was a good experience!
