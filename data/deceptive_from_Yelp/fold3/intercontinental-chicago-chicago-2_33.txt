Ok, I am hoping if I post something maybe things will change.  Not sure what the problem is but am getting unpleasant curt responses when asking for help in area. So far have only spoken with females.  Not easy when you don't know a place.  Please manager tell staff to be pleasant with guests, this isn't 4.5 star service when people can't get questions asked in a decent manner.
