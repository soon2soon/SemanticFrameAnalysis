My wife and I went to Palomar Hotel few days following our wedding. We had our flight from NYC in the morning and arrived few hours early - the stuff was so nice and stored our luggage until then time we could come back to check in. We really enjoyed every aspect in our visit to the hotel and it helped making our overall vacation to Chicago more pleasant. Everything was so clean and well designed.
