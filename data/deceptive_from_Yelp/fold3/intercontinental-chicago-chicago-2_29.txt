I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago for 4 days in late July. The A/C did not work and the management was not equipped to fix the issue for 4 days! I called in every night and all they did was to offer an apology and a promise to fix the issue the day later. Nothing happened. Later I found out the majority of the people from the conference I was attending had similar issues (i.e. A/C showing 64 while the room is 87). I guess it was a systematic, and unethical, money saving trick employed by the whole hotel. Opening the windows was not an option as I was given a room by the Mich Avenue, where you have Firetrucks etc. running every hour or so making it too loud to sleep. That wasn't the only problem. The internet code for wifi did not work for 4 days. They gave me two cards with two codes and nothing! What else. Towels were not changed one day. I mean come on! This isn't a 2 star hotel. And come to find out the only way to go to your upper floor room is via elevator (i.e. there is no stairs! not even a fire escape), which is problematic when the whole conference of people are trying to go up (i.e. wait times of 20 mins at times). What is worst is management took no responsibility for all of this. None. Unbelievable! This was worse than a Motel 6. Never staying at this or any other Intercontinental Hotel again. Lesson learned.
