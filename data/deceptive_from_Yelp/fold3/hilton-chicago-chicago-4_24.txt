I am sorry but I don't like this place. The building is very old and crappy. The rooms are very old. The showers are disgusting and don't function well. The beds are way too soft and break your back sleeping on them. Â The place is outrageously expensive and not really worth the price. The staff is very nice and helpful, but sorry the place is just not nice.
