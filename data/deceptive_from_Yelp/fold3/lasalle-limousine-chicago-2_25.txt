I used La Salle Limosine for my wedding day, and overall I was very disappointed in the service. After arriving 40 MINUTES LATE to pick me and my bridal party up at my hotel to drive us to the church, the driver's only explanation for being late was that Transformers was being filmed and some streets in the city were closed. Give me a break! If someone is hiring you to drive them around on their wedding day, it is your responsibility to find out all of those details in advance, and plan accordingly. Not to offer some pathetic excuse the day of. If that wasn't enough, at the end of the day the driver had the nerve to hassle me about getting carbon copy of my credit card for his manager, despite the fact that everything was prepaid. I'm sorry, what bride carries her credit card with her on her wedding day, and what year is it anyways!?! Who needs carbon copies anymore!? Bottomline: If you are looking to book a limo company for your wedding day or otherwise, my advice is keep looking.
