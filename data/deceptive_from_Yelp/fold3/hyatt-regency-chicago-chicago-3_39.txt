I enjoyed my stay here in February, but this place is not without its disadvantages. I decided to book via getaroom bit.ly/l3aVjS which was advertising a pretty cheap rate at the time. Pros: - Super close to top attractions including Magnificent mile, Navy Pier, etc. - Attractive lobby - Friendly staff - Comfortable room - Nice gym Cons: - No free internet. Huh? - Food at the restaurant = not cheap - Can sometimes get a little crowded All in all, this place is worth checking out.
