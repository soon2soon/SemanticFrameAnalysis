Hey, this is my home away from home!!  I've been coming to Chicago for business once or twice a month, and the HGI - MM has always my first choice for about 12 years.  The staff are incredibly service oriented, if you're a Hilton Honors member, Zenepa and the front desk crew know your preferences right down to "would you like one large, or two small" bottled waters!  Whatever you need, they will find!  The Weber Grill (in the building) is a fun hang-out, sports oriented bar with giant grills so you can watch your steak being cooked.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.  Ask about special rates, and "The parking package".  Happy Travels!
