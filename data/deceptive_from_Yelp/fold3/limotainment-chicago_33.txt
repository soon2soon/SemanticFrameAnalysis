I contacted Mike at Limotainment to see about getting a coach bus for a weekend day trip with a bunch of friends.  His fleet was already reserved for the day in question but he immediately made an effort to connect me with another contact that could accommodate my plans.  He was immediately interested in keeping a good relationship for possible future travel. My impression is that Limotainment has a commitment to customer loyalty and high-quality service.  If I have a need for future transport services, I will contact Mike at Limotainment.
