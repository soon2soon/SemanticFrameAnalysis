I've stayed at a lot of hotels, and thankfully don't have a lot of negative experiences to compare anything to, but I have lots of superlative experiences, and the Hotel Palomar Chicago has just moved up into that category.  From the obvious - good valet and staff at the front desk, to the subtle - mentioning and congratulating us on our anniversary several times, dropping off a bottle of champagne, and coming by to see if we needed chocolate, this was an incredible time.  Not to mention the really cool bathrobes - if I didn't already have one, this would have ended up in my suitcase for sure!
