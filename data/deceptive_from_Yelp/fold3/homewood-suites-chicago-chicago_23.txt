This is a very nice place. There is free WiFi that is easy-to-use but expires every day and you have to do it again. The pool was decent, as well as the fitness center, both which were on the 19th floor. (Top floor) On the ground floor, there was this cramped space that served as a sort of "lobby". Complete with a TV and slow elevator waits on the first floor, it gets about 2 stars. The main lobby on the sixth floor is where you check-in and get free breakfast and dinner daily. It is a lot nicer then the little space on the ground floor. The standard room is quite nice. There is a living room space with a TV in it and a little kitchen where you can fill out a grocery list and have the hotel management shop for you. They have coffee, microwave popcorn, a microwave, and a fridge in there. Through the door by the TV takes you into the outstanding bedroom complete with another TV and lots of dresser space. Then there is a pretty nice bathroom of the bedroom as well. Overall, Homewood Suites is a nice place to stay, despite a few flaws.
