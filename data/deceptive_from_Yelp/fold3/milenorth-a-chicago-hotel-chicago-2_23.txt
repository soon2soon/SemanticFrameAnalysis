I was definitely underwhelmed by this place. It's just off the Mag Mile and so close to all kinds of dining, shopping, and entertainment. Rooms are OK, too. What set me off though was the incompetence of the staff. We were given a gift certificate to the hotel and so couldn't book online. You'd think handling a gift certificate would be pretty straightforward, but it wasn't. It took three separate phone calls among I don't know how many staff members before we were able - FINALLY - to book our room. It was as if they'd never heard of a gift certificate before. When we showed up to check in, the process started all over again. The desk clerk looked at the certificate like it was written in Swahili and kept going back and forth between the certificate and her monitor. I guess she was waiting for the answer to her dilemma to magically appear. Anyway, we were finally able to check in. They wanted us to provide a credit card to "cover incidentals". You can guess what happens next. We checked out, went home and I logged onto my credit card account. Sure enough, there is a charge for the room pending on my card. As soon as the charge changed from "pending" to "posted", I disputed the charge. Would I stay here again? I don't know. Right now, I'd say "Never". But, in a couple of months, after an appropriate cooling off period, I think I might if I got a deal on the room rate. P.s. The manager is just a complete failure .. Clueless
