I used Home James 3 times total, the first two were very pleasant.  Professional and on time. The 3rd time I had a very frustrating experience.  The company called 10 minutes before my scheduled pick-up to tell me the driver was running 5 minutes late, but was only a few blocks away.  10 minutes past my pick-up time, the company called again and said the driver was literally blocks way and they would be at my place shortly.  Finally, 10 minutes later I called back and the person answering the phone said "the driver lied to us before, and is really further away then they said, but won't say where they are, but not to going anywhere, because the driver will arrive shortly". By the time I ran for a cab and caught one, I ended up missing my flight and was re-booked on one 5 hours later.  The person I spoke to at the company said the owner would call me personally and the company would pay for my cab - but neither happened and I never heard from them again. I would strongly recommend using an alternative car service.
