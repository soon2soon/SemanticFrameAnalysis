Hello, I'm writing this review to tell you about my experience at the La Quinta inn. I personally love staying at hotels, & was excited to try out this hotel. The key element to a great hotel is good costumer service. Well, I wasn't too ecstatic when I got sass from the workers when I first stepped in. The workers had no respect for me. They treated me as if I was their child, letting me not leave the hotel to get food, because I was considered "underage," even though my parents allowed me to leave the hotel when I desired to. Anther mishap that occurred at my stay was a problem with the mechanics. I bought ice cream & put it in the refrigerator that came with my room. The refrigerator was not working, so a worker brought us up a new one. The new refrigerator smelled like raw fish, & had food inside of it. I don't understand how somebody can do that, & get away with it. Lastly, costumers are provided with free wifi. However, the wifi didn't work, and actually crashed multiple apps that I was trying to be on. Next time I'm in the city I'll stick to the Marriott or the four seasons. I advise you to do so also!
