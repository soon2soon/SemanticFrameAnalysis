I took my staff out for our bi-annual Employee appreciation party a few weeks ago and for the first time I decided to use this company and it could not have worked out any better. Mike was my point of contact and was awesome to work with. It was very easy to get it all set up and he even met me at my first pick up site just to say hi. He walked me trough the truck to show me how everything worked so that we would be able to play our own music. We made multiple stops and his driver which I believe his name was Priest was fantastic. He had a good time with us and was very easy going. We are planning another event in July and I know if we need transportation we will definitely be going through Limotainment! Thanks again Mike and Priest!
