I am using Hotel Palomar for the room block for my wedding.  Not only is the hotel beautiful, clean, and unique but April (the person who coordinated our room block) is AMAZING.  She's really helpful and patient (two things that are very much appreciated during the stressful wedding planning process).  She was professional and quick to answer questions, but also worked really hard to get our guests a good deal. Also, one perk that we really love, is that they have adjoining suites at the end of the hall that can be adjoined via a door in the hallway.  This way, the suites adjoin when both doors are open and the hallway door is shut, but they don't share a doorway or a wall.  This is great for a wedding when you want to share a big room the night before the wedding, but then want completely separate suites for the wedding night. Finally, you can't review the Palomar without talking about the Sable Bar.  Easily the best hotel bar in downtown Chicago - delicious food and amazing cocktails. We are really excited to share such a special space with our guests.  We hope they like it as much as we do. :)
