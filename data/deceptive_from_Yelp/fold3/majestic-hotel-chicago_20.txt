The service at this hotel is exceptional. All the staff was friendly and willing to help when needed. The hotel was beautiful and clean. Restaurants were within walking distance and easily accessible. The lounge and outside viewing area was beautiful. We stayed with children and the hotel was very friendly and fun with them.
