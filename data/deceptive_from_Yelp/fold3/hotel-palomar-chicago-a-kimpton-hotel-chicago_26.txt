What a great place to spend your anniversary! I heard about the new hotel from my interior designer. She works for GREC Architects who designed the whole building inside and out. My husband and I wanted to do something special for our 5th anniversary but didn't have time to travel far. The Palomar was the right choice. It had everything we wanted, an upscale restaurant, workout facility and wonderful views of the city.
