I took the tour of Chinatown and I had a really nice time.   Joyce was a great tour guide.   I have been to Chinatown several times before but getting a better understanding of history behind it is great and makes me appreciate alot more.   Also she take you to a hidden gem in Chinatown that is unbelievable.    I have been on several tours before and believe me the type of experience you have depend on the tour guide and Joyce is a great tour guide.   I plan to go on other tours that she offers.
