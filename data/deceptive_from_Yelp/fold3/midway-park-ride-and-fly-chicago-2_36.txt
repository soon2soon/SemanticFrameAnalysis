Excellent experience.  My wife and neighbors had previously used Midway PR&F and recommended it to me.  I used the online features (including a discount).  The lot was easily accessible and the shuttle was waiting for me after I got to my parking space and to take me to Midway.   When I returned late in the evening, I texted the number provided and received an immediate confirmation.  As promised, the shuttle was waiting as soon as I had my luggage and returned me to my car without delay. All the employees were pleasant and helpful.  The lot is large, clean and well lit.
