Top notch place to stay! We stayed there for two nights on our cross-country road trip in 2010. Wow, the staff were GREAT and they were very dog friendly. It was close to shopping and sights. Oprah films down the street and it is a short hop on the elevated train to Wrigley Field. There is a (not so deep) pool, valet parking, wine tasting each evening and AWESOME coffee in the morning. Relatively cheap for a big-city hotel. Oh, and the bathrobes are hysterical!
