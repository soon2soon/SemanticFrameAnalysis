We spent our Christmas here a couple of years ago.  It was our first trip to Chicago.  The rooms were very comfortable and the breakfasts were wonderful.  Our hostess ensured that everything was perfect.  The location made getting everywhere very easy.  It was great having off-street parking and a garage!  We still talk about that Christmas being one of the best!
