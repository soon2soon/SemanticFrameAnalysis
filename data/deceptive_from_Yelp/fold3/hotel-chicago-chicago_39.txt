Quite possibly one of the top ten business-friendly hotels I have experienced with a funky, contemporary flare.  I am still here and enjoying the lively atmosphere that the tranquil lobby transforms into in the evening. As other reviews metioned, the beds are fully rejuvinating and hard to leave.  I will leave more after my stay, but had to jot these down as I have friends looking for a fun Chicago hotel near most everything.
