Was a bit nervous after reading some not so great reviews. We drove from Indy and wanted to save some money on parking on our 3 day vacation to Chicago. We never use out car when we get there and hate to pay the $100 for it just to sit there. So I emailed the South Shore line to ask about overnight parking in the Hammond lot and if it was allowed and the fees. I was very impressed to get a phone call and an email back saying that it would be safer to park on the East Chicago lot since the police headquarters are there and that Hammond usually fills quickly. . She also asked for the year, make and model of our car so that they would know it would be there for 3 days. The parking was free and there was room in the lot at 12:30 on a Friday. Best part was the train was brand new! Very clean, didn't have to pay the skyway tolls and it was relaxing. No need to stress while driving in the crazy Chicago traffic. $5.25 per person each way! Highly recommended.
