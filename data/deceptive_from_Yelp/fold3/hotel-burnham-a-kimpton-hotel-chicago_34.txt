This is the first yelp review I've written but my experience at the Burnham was amazing!  The ironwork architecture is beautiful and the staff is incredibly resourceful and hospitable.  The Atwood is also excellent.  The staff and food was on par with the hotel.  I will only stay at the Burnham when in Chicacgo from now on hands down.
