We drove from southern indiana to the southshore train and began figuring out a place to stay while on it. We should have planned ahead, but luckily IHSP had a room at a great price. We took a taxi over and were amazed to see how incredibly clean the place was, how friendly the people were, and how much free stuff they provided! {netflix, gorgeous roof access, kitchen, coffee, PANCAKES!} Needless to say, we slept great and I will look for an IHSP the next time I travel. Great place for a Great price! And the guy working at the desk was smoking hot. :]
