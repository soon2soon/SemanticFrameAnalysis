When planning a vacation pls go to Liberty Travel and work with AMANDA!!  She is awesome, helpful, and knowledgeable!  I have worked with Amanda on 3 vacations.  One of the trips she totally picked the location and it did not disappoint!!  Amanda planned my honeymoon and most recently a vacation for 4 people flying from different locations in the country (yes I had to make it difficult!) The most important thing to know is that I travel often and is not really cheaper to book online.  I think that is a big misconception when booking travel!  I always do my research and find the pricing the same and in my most recent experience cheaper!! Amanda scored us a free night at the resort!!
