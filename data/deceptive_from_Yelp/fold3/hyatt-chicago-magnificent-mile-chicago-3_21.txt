The staff was top-notch, helpful, and VERY professional.  The Hyatt also had some of the best decor of any hotel I've ever stayed in. The food prices caused me to venture out and I'm glad I did because I found a great corner bakery and a great pizza joint.  Having a Starbucks right on the first floor was great for those of us who enjoy people-watching with our java. Note:  I'm 49 years old and this is the first hotel I've ever stayed at that charged for internet access and the bottled water in the rooms. Overall a pleasant visit though.
