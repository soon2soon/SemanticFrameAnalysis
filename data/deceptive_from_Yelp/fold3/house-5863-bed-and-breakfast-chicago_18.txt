Absolutely loved our stay.  This place is a great value for the price, with lovely modern decor, friendly service (the owner even made my partner a sandwich when she wandered into the kitchen looking hungry!), and a pretty back patio.  It was like staying in the cool downtown apartment of a friend who was out of town for the weekend (and I say that as a New Yorker!).  Close to the L for getting downtown, too.  Would definitely stay there again.
