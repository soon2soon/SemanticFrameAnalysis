A friend and I stayed here while in town for a conference and extended sight seeing trip. The location was within walking distance from the train and plenty of restaurants around it. Including the cute little diner, which is a part of the property. There was a fabulous pizza place nearby and Japanese restaurant right around the corner. Not to mention the famous R Kelly McDonalds across from it... lol. Listen this is a basic motel located a stones throw from way more expensive places. When I come to places like this, its not to stay in the room all day. I'm out exploring and enjoying the city. Plus its better than handing over your money to some faceless corporate chain. Enjoy your stay, I know I did. : )
