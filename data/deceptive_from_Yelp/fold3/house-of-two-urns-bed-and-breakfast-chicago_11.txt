The host is very unfriendly and offputting. She seems to not like people. She offered no assistance with luggage on the very steep stairs. She offers a list of restaurants in the area with no directions, addresses, or hints as to what the food or price range is. She does, however, offer stern lectures on what you can and cannot do, had sniping signs of dos and don'ts all over and in general seems to hate having people come into her house. I might have been more comfortable if I were alone. The rooms are TINY. REALLY REALLY TINY. We were in the Chambre of Tacky Cat Decor, in a small bed crammed against the wall with a desk crammed against the foot. One person is forced to climb over the other to get in and out of bed. IT IS SIMPLY NOT SUITABLE FOR TWO PEOPLE. Â  The decor of the common rooms is period, dark Victorian, nice if you like dark Victorian except for some really angry and ugly art. A common kitchen is offered, a nice touch which is why this gets 2 stars, but be warned it's stocked with really bad coffee. For the price, they should do better than costco cans of Folgers. Wouldn't recommend it. It could be nice with better personalities. Be certain to ask if two people can actually be comfortable in a room.
