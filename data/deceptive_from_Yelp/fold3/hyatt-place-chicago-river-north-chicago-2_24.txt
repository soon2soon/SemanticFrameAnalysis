Stayed here recently with a group of friends, and it was my first time in a hotel in the city. I was very impressed by this hotel! The staff is very welcoming, friendly and helpful. They seemed to go the extra mile to make sure our group was taken care of. The room was comfortable and had an excellent city view! Breakfast is included and it's a nice buffet. The hotel is in such a great location, close to restaurants and bars. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, seems family friendly as well.
