The hotel has a great location, close to subway, buses, and retail. The lobby is beautiful. I was greeted very nicely by the front desk clerk. The room was beautiful with a lot of old world charm. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and beautiful. Overall it was a great experience at La Quinta Inn & Suites . When I come back to Chicago I will be staying there again.
