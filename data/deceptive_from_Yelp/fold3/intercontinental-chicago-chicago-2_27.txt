My husband and I booked this hotel through hotwire (which we use all the time). We chose the hotel because it was listed as a 4.5 star. The Intercontinental is FAR from 4.5 stars. That rank is based on name only. Only thing this hotel has going for it is the great location. We checked in to the hotel and were given what was is probably the "hotwire" hotel. I tiny odd shaped dark, dingy, and musty room. We complained about the room and were moved into a larger handicap room. Because this was handicap accessible the fixtures and whatnot were not as nice. The A/C in this room did not work so at 4:30am we requested another room and they sent keys up. We packed up and went to the other room and the keys would not work. Security came to assist us and we found as we entered the new room that ther was already guests in that room sleeping! In this day to walk in and suprise someone sleeping could be very dangerous!! You never know who those people were! We went back to the lobby where we had to wait for about 30 minutes for the ONE clerk on duty to go in the back office and speak with the manager. They came back with keys for another room. This room was small but much newer and brighter then the first two. A few other notes- the towels are HORRIBLE! They are small, shabby, and worn. I could not even wrap one around myself and I could see through the worn sections on them. The shower smelled of mildew like they used dirty rags to clean it. The staff was rude and not helpful at all despite all the issues we had. They could have cared less that we were unhappy!! I will NEVER stay at another InterContinental again. My husband and I travel quite often and normally stay at Hilton or Westin. I will stick with these top brands! I have never complained or posted complaints about a hotel in the past but I feel this is a must so that other's aren't fooled by this hotel.
