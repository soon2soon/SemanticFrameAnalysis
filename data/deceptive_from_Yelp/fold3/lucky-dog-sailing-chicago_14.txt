Would highly recommend Lucky Dog Sailing.  What a fantastic way to see and show off to your out of town guests the fabulous Chicago skyline! The boat is well kept, spacious and comfortable.  Kristi and Tom could not be better Captain, First Mate and Photographer and Hosts. Through Tom and Kristi's generosity,  we bid on this cruise in a charity auction and would definitely do so again!
