I travel quite a bit and I must say I LOVE HOTEL SAX! From check-in to check-out, everyone that I interacted with made me feel comfortable. My first impression was the nice experience I had with the bell attendant, Murphy. He went above and beyond! Then, at the front desk, the gentleman was very attentive and accomodating to all my special request. Friday night, there were free appetizers in the bar. The potstickers were delicious! The drinks were perfect. The lounge is just as swanky as the rooms. I did meet a few celebrities while staying at the hotel. There is so much to do in the area! Dicks's Last Resort, Bin 36, House of Blues, Bowling, Boatrides - all feet away from the hotel doors. The view from the 14th floor was magnificent. I wish I could have brought the snakeskin armchair home with me that complimented my hotel room! I tried to get Hotel Sax to sell it to me! Parking is $52 at the Sax but I parked in a lot 2 blocks over for only $20 overnight. Everyone in housekeeping was very friendly. The last night I was there, I just so happen to be standing next to the Night Manager, Malachi Armstrong. He had a very nice demeanor and showed so much excitement that I stayed at his hotel. He conversed with me and a friend for about 20 minutes about our stay and making sure we were happy. His customer service was greater than I ever anticipated. He ask us to stay at the Hotel Sax when I come back to Chicago. He even gave his contact information in case I have any trouble making a reservation. It was interaction that placed the icing on the cake for me. I will stay here whenever I visit Chicago. I recommend staying here if you like the feeling of being treated as an A list guest. I felt like this was one of the 1st Class hotels in Chicago. Keep up the great work! I can't wait to return! Chacha
