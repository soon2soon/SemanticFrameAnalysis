Having sailed with Tom & Kristi in the Caribbean, and a number of times on Lake Michigan, not to mention I've known them for many years, you will never find a more gracious, professional, warm and friendly couple to sail with!  They are all about service, safety, and maximizing your experience... 10 out of 10!  Book a trip on the Lucky Dog (named after their very adorable dog, Sammy) before the summer is over - you'll be glad you did!
