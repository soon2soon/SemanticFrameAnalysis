My family and I went on the boat ride for the Firework show last night.  It was beautiful seeing the Chicago skyline from Lake Michigan.  I wasn't too happy that all we did was sit, listen to music, and see the city skyline.  The ticket booth lady told me we would go down the river talk a little bit about the buildings and then go out on the lake to view the skyline and fireworks.  I have to admit, the firework show from the boat is amazing!!!
