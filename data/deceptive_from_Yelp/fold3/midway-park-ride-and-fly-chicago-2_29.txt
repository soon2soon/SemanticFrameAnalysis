I am very impressed.    Our return flight was on New Years Eve and they was several inches of snow on our car.  We were traveling with two small children too.   When the driver took us to our car -  he stopped right behind our car.  There was no need to try to drag all of our stuff plus the kids through the parking lot.   He told us to wait there and he cleaned off our car while we stayed in the warn shuttle. Then he and my husband loaded the car up while I waited in the warm shuttle.   I will always use them when flying out of Midway! Look on-line - you can always find coupons which balance of the booking fee!
