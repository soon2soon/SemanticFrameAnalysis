We can't recommend this B&B.  First I should say that due to a mix up with our train bookings we had to depart a day early. Their late cancellation policy is 'no refund', which we accepted without question. However, checkout time is midday, and minutes after that the proprietor knocked on the door demanding our immediate departure so the maid could clean. We were in a hurry to leave, but this seemed unnecessary, since we'd effectively paid until the following day.   An additional US$75 cancellation fee on top of the full room cost cancellation seemed excessive. Surely a night's accommodation forfeited would have been fair without this exorbitant add on! Their self described 'urban hip' translates to slightly shabby Spartan, though reasonably clean it's tired and in need of renovation. The outdoor breakfast deck is dangerously slippery and needs water blasting. Bath towel had a hole and all linen needed replacement. No toweling bath mat, instead an unhygienic wooden bath mat. Paint splashes all over the bathroom tiles, fittings removed without painting over the marks on the wall didn't look good. Bedroom had no operative overhead light, and only one bedside light was provided. No local maps provided, indifferent breakfast, and indifferent, unprofessional hospitality made this very poor value, especially in comparison to the many faultless B&Bs we've experienced during nearly three months travelling throughout the USA. The proprietor would benefit from professional training in hospitality. His venal, uncaring attitude demonstrates that he regards House 5863 as a golden goose that requires the least possible effort on his part.
