I just went on my first sailing trip with Just Sailing, and WOW, what a way to see Chicago! And what made it even better is how relaxed and knowledgeable Justin was. He makes you feel like everything is control and to just enjoy the ride. Another perk is how close and convenient it is to get to downtown Chicago-literally right at lake shore and monroe. So, if you're just visiting Chicago, its super easy to get to from all of the tourist sites. I work downtown, and its super easy for me to get to. I would definitely recommend this anyone who is interested in seeing Chicago like a local or a local who feels like they have a boat! the intimate group setting is perfect and guarantees memorable and great times!!!
