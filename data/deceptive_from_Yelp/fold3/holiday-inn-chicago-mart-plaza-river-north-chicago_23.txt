My daughter just  had her wedding reception at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza in the Wolf Point Ballroom.  She wanted a true Chicago vibe and this venue was a home run.   First of all, you get to work with Barbara Martin who will take you from start to finish.  For me, I did not need a day of wedding coordinator because Barbara is a working for you the whole time.  Everything went smooth because of her.  She is a true professional and excellent at her job.  The food was better than what you would expect for a wedding and we received many compliments on it (especially the chicken).  The view is jaw dropping!! Lucky for us, we had such a beautiful day. I loved the fact that they had 2 rooms - one for cocktails and one for the reception.   The whole day was flawless and I credit that to Barbara Martin and her staff.
