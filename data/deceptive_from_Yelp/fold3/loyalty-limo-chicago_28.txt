I call these guys up for a reservation and no one has the professional etiquette for responding properly. When I ask the person to speak with the manager or his supervisor....he says they don't have anyone like that and puts me on hold. If this is the kind of service they provide just communicating over the phone then I wonder what their actual limo service is like. I was really looking forward to using this service as it came recommended by friends. But this place gets a sure "Eek! Methinks not." Â from me.
