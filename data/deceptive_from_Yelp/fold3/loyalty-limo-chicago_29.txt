I wanted to do something big for my birthday so I had came onto yelp to help me find a limo company that would be worth the money. I came across Loyalty Limo and it was the best thing that has ever happened to me, Vince was very professional and nice. Everything came to me in a timely manner, the information about the limo and its packages. I honestly can say everything was perfect. The driver got to my house on time and patiently waited for a couple of my friends who were late. I will without a doubt be using them again and will recommend them to anyone. :)
