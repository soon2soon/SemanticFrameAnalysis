We chose the Hotel Lincoln for a recent shopping trip to the city and could not have been happier with our choice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the room was just the perfect size. The location was within walking distance to several restaurants and unique shops. The rooftop bar offered a view of the city like no other I have ever seen. Even though we had already had dinner when we went to check it out, the menu was so tempting that we couldn't resist indulging in a few appetizers while we enjoyed the view. Overall a great experience and I look forward to visiting again soon!
