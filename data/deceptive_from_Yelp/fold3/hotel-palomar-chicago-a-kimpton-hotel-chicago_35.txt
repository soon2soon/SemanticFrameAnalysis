We needed a place to stay for our last night in Chicago - we had been traveling for a week and a half and Chicago had been where we flew into originally and where we were flying home from.  Two days before we needed the hotel I bid for a 4 star hotel on Priceline and go the Hotel Palomar for $100.00!!!!!  Such a deal - beautiful hotel, great location, awesome views from out 8th floor room and again from the rooftop terrace (although it was quite dizzying also). The staff were very congenial and helpful,  the room was large and the bed was very firm and comfortable.  The only problem, and it could be because I'm a little clutzy, was the frame for the bed - it had sharp corners that stuck out and were easy to run into - which I did and sustained a nice bruise - other than that, I would absolutely stay at this hotel again.  Loved it!
