Dear Metra Business Owner, I take the Metra because the traffic in Chicago is terrible and this is a good alternative, but: - The conductors are very unfriendly! Not even boarded and sitting u here "Ticket"  Not a good Morning or a Please or whatever! - The trains are so outdated! We (USA) are supposed to be the world technology   leader! Have u ever seen trains in Europe or Asia? 20 years advanced! - it takes forever! 20 miles ride, 45 min! - usage of the restrooms impossible! Not even running water! The best are the ride price inrease! How can u consider this? What kind of improvements have u achieved? Not even gas prices went up! Overall I would have given negative stars, but I can't!
