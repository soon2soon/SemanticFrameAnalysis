Well, the initial customer service regarding cancellation was a complete joke. I was told that the cancellation policy was 24 hours for the limo, which is what is expressed on their rate sheet (homejameschicago.com/spe…). I  was making a reservation for New Years and would not have expected a 24 hour cancellation policy but that is what their own website said and what was confirmed to me via an email. However, when I receive the contract, I see that the cancellation policy is 7 days.  At the time we were making the reservation, 7 days would not have been any cancellation policy, which is why I was very annoyed about the false advertisement. I was assured this was a mistake on the part of the web site maintenance person and it would be fixed immediately. It is STILL not fixed. The owner did work with me on the issue a bit but in the end did NOT honor the cancellation policy advertised and CONFIRMED to me in an email.  In the end, I ended up giving them a try anyway due to the insistence of the person I talked to that we would be well taken care of. On the night of, our driver was early, but not very friendly. She also did not speak very good English and was not very knowledgeable about Chicago and things we could do except making sure we did not miss the fireworks at Navy Pier. When she dropped us off at our destination (we did the hourly service, by the way), she handed us a card to call her for pick-up but the card was from American Limousine, not Home James. It became apparent that Home James contracted the jobs out, which is not really a problem except, I hired Home James, not some outside service. In short: - Negatives: customer service/advertisement, lack of knowledge of driver and lack of friendliness Positives: Price, clean car, good, safe driving, and only being charged from the time of pick-up and not travel to pick-up. I don't think I'd use the service again or recommend to a friend but I would not rule it out.
