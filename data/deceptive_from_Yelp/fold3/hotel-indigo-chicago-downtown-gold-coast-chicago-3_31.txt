I read a sample of reviews before writing this.  This is the first and may be the last time I ever do a review on Yelp, I'm not a fan of these things, but in this case, I am doing it. I felt many of the reviews were somewhat harsh.  YOU try finding a hotel in a decent neighborhood in Chicago for less than $100 a night (and that included the tax!).  I was surprised and arrived not expecting much.   SATFF AND ACCOMMODATIONS: The staff, for the most part, were exceedingly  helpful, cordial, and cheerful.  This is an older hotel building, so be ready for what hotel room dimensions used to be like, yes, they were smaller, the halls were narrower.  However, I found my room to be more than adequate.  The décor, while possibly out of place in cold, snowy Chicago, was lighthearted and fun.  My room had everything I wanted, coffee maker, Wifi, big screen tv, hairdryer, desk, plenty of lighting.  And it was clean.    Sure, there was a bit of wear and tear showing here and there, but the hotel seems to be in the middle of upgrades, so I'm sure they know. VALUE - For heaven's sake people, do you know what a typical hotel costs in downtown Chicago these days?!?  This place was not only a bargain, but pleasant, clean, safe and convenient on its own merits but with the added benefit of being affordable, the only thing that kept this from being 5 stars is that it's not the Ritz.   CONCLUSION: I will not only heartily recommend this hotel to friends (or maybe not, part of me would  like to keep such a deal a secret) but will absolutely, positively, stay here again on future trips.   Thus endeth my first and probably last review on Yelp..
