Excuse my language but fuck La Quinta. I came here for a birthday party and they limited everything we could do. We came in, the customer service was TERRIBLE, the workers were so rude and almost kicked us out because THEY didn't have a room ready. Also, we couldn't use things that they offer customers like the pool and the fitness room. We had parents with us at all times and they yelled at us for fucking enjoying ourselves. Our refrigerator did not work and we were punished for it. We came not intending on getting two rooms, and we were forced to. Spending way more money than we intended to. Everything was so over priced and the parking was FOURTY SIX DOLLARS FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS. Nearly fifty fucking dollars for one day. I only gave this one star because I had to. Don't waste your money on this fucking shit ass hotel if you're planning on TALKING or SMILING.
