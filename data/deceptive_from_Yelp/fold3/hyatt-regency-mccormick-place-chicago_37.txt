Upon arriving the hotel, I thought I was coming to a four star hotel until it came time to take a shower. There was mildew all over the shower curtain. I called to complain and concierge said they were going to take care of the issue right away. I just thought a hotel with such high standards would be better maintained. For the price paid per night you shouldn't experience such an inconvenience for a newly newly renovated hotel.
