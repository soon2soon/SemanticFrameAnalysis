Like a magic carpet ride! It actually cuts the time getting to Midway. Better than parking and hauling your bags and skis all over the place. This place does it for you. No need to ask friends for rides to the airport. It's located away from the hairiest traffic near the airport, so I don't have to drive that stretch when arrive back at Midway. For details see the other reviews. I loved it. Better than the other park and rides that I've tried to Midway.
