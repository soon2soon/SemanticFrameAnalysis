My company booked Insight to take me to Ohare for a business trip this past week and I was very impressed. The driver was not foreign and the car was brand new. The driver was early to pick my up and did not rush me while I was finishing packing.  He just sat out front patiently in the car. When he saw me open the front door he practically sprinted to help me with my bags. He even offered me the option to be dropped off at the curb or for him to park and help me with my bags to the check in desk.  Best limo service I have ever used to get to the airport! I will for sure use them again!
