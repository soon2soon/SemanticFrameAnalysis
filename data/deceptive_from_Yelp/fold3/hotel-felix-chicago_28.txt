Room was great, bed was comfortable but everything in regards to service seemed to go wrong. Valet took at least 20min to acknowledge our arrival, TV didn't work in the room unless you wiggled the cords, the quick dials on the phones didn't reach the correct department and what frustrated us the most was that the front desk didn't apologize or acknowledge the issues. Good for one night if you need a cheaper high end hotel, but they don't live up to Chicago standards.
