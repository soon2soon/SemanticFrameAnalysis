We asked for a room with a view that allowed smoking and we were given a front corner room on the floor with views towards Pershing Square. I really loved the huge windows that opened. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The hotel itself is very lovely, they have a beautiful pool from the ' with amazing tile work. The location was perfect for exploring downtown and for using the metro and light rails to get around Chicago, IL car-free, which makes Chicago, IL so much more relaxing. We really loved this hotel.
