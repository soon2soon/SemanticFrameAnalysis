My husband & I stayed for a weekend at JW Marriott Chicago for our anniversary in March, 2003 and were so very impressed! The staff was wonderful and extremely accommodating. Our room was just beautiful and very very clean. We would highly recommend a stay at JW Marriott Chicago, especially when celebrating a special ocassion.
