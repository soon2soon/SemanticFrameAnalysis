This is the second time I have used Insight Limo service.  The first was for my wedding and the second was for a birthday party my wife and I had where we brought 20 friends to Medieval Times.   Jorge is a class act entrepreneur.  He treats his clients well and is straight forwards in his approach.  His limos are clean and came stocked with some water, beers, and sodas for the guests.   I would recommend his service above all other limo services in the city of Chicago.
