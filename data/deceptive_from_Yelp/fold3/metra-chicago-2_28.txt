I am from the St. Louis, Missouri area, and was visiting Illinois Math and Science Academy.  My hotel in Aurora told me to take the Metra from Chicago Union Station to the last Aurora stop.  I thought that would be great.  The trip to Aurora was fine.  It was crowded, but everyone was nice.  And, if it's crowded then they are making money.  That is good, they need to stay solvent. The trip back to Union Station from Aurora was a nightmare.  The Metra train lost power in Lisle, Illinois, and they wouldn't tell us anything for about an hour.  I needed to catch the last train back to St. Louis in another two hours.  The conductor was nice, but told me that it wouldn't happen.  It would be three or four hours.  It cost me over $60 for a cab(which I didn't have).  It was because of the generosity of the people riding the train that I was able to get back to Union Station in time for my train.  When planning for the trip, I had allowed an extra hour and a half back at Union Station.  Apparently, that is not a large enough layover if you're riding Metrarail. To add insult to injury, when I wrote Metra about the experience, they sent me a rude form letter that didn't address my particular concern.  At the time, I had a child with me that had Type 1 Diabetes, and not enough insulin to stay another overnight in Chicago.  The conductor was nice, but the only thing he could tell me to do was call an ambulance because they had not kept their people well informed.   I tell everyone now.  When traveling to Chicago, only take the Metra if you have three or more extra hours to get where you need, and they will not refund your tickets if you are on their trains, and their trains quit working.  I can understand, if I hadn't made it onto your train.  However, we were on it, when it quit working, and they would not refund us our tickets.
