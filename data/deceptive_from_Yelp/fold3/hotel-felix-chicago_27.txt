My husband and I just spend 3 days/2 nights at this location.  I strictly choose this location based on the overall ratings on hotels.com, expedia, etc..... * The rooms are oh-so tiny *Our pre-ordered bottle of champagne was not waiting in our room as requested.  When I called the front desk - they apologized and said "the request was buried under a pile of paperwork *Upon reserving my room for two adults - still only one bathrobe in the bathroom (I found that odd considering my reservation was made for 2 adults) *Lamp in bedroom was broken *Some type of splatter all over walls - not sure if it was water leaking within the walls or what - dirty *I am very particular on hotel bedding.  Here is their set-up:  mattress - then flat sheet - then another flat sheet - then comforter - then another flat sheet; yuck!!! *Tried to order a movie at 8:30pm on Friday- our on-demand feed wasn't working.  After trying to fix it, two hours later we were finally moved to a new room at 10:30pm - had to re-pack all of our stuff *You need a card to work the elevator - our card worked 1 out of 5 times *The poor bell-boy was also running inside behind the desk checking people in Overall - way too expensive for what you get.  For an additional $50.00 spend the money and stay somewhere else.  It is a great location - but quality was horrible.
