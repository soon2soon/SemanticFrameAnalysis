Best thing about this hostel are three main things: Location, breakfast and cleaning level. You get pretty good value to your money. Few things you should be aware of: tax in Chicago raise the real price by 16 percent, the wifi works really badly in your personal room and couple of the ladies at the front desk are not that nice. But in general, it's a really good hostel to stay in.
