The suite was spacious and luxurious. Location was great and loved the neighborhood. Roxanna, the manager, was wonderful in helping us resolve a problem with our 3rd party booking agent (Hint: after you find a good rate on a 3rd party website, call the hotel directly so they can match the rate).  Our stay here was wonderful in every way and we were sorry to leave.  But we'll come to the Majestic again!
