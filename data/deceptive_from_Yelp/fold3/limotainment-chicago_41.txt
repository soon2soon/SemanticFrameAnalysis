We had an employee outing and used Limotainment for our transportation.  Could not have been happier with everything from start to finish. Mike and Priest were absolutely great.  The party bus was clean, comfortable, and stocked with everything we need and plenty of space for our 25 person group.  Got to all of our destinations on time and had a ton of fun on the way (the sound system is pretty unbelievable.)  We had a blast and will definitely use Limotainment again!
