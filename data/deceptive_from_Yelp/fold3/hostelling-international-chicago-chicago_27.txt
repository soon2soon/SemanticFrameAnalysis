Great place! Good price, excelent location in a safe area. Near to Millenium Park, The "bean". You can rent a city bike for 7 bucks 24 hrs, And ride on Lake Shore. Near to blue And red subway lines. Friendly staff, clean, open 24/7. In our "female premium dorm" we have a little kitchen, microwave. Free breakfast, its ok, could be better. I recommend it.
