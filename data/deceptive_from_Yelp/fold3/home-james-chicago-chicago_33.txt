I called to set up a limo for this past Sunday evening.  Spent several minutes on the phone with a gentleman who was very nice, took down name, number, credit card, flight info etc.  and confirmed Sunday pick up.  Said I would get an email to confirm but it never came.  Checked spam etc. and it did not get hung up there either.  So I called Sunday morning to confirm and could only get an answering machine so sent an email - again no response and nothing in spam when I checked later.  Called again from the airport still just the answering machine.  Tried once more on the plane and someone finally answered and they had never heard of me, they had no record at all of me in their system or that I had set up a ride.  I was on the plane at this time and had to hang up due to departure so asked them to text me if they could pick me up at the other end or not and gave my number.  Never got a text, call or anything.  I was very disappointed in this company.
