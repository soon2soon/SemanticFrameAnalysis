The car was on time for the initial pick up, but I was disappointed to see a Mercury Grand Marquis instead of a Lincoln Town Car like the company's photos depict and as most car services use.  The driver was neither polite nor friendly.  If fact, he didn't even great me.  He simply picked up my bags and got back in the car.     As for the ride home from the airport, the service was lousy.  I called from Miami 4-hours before arriving at ORD to confirm the pick up time, but was surprised to find that the dispatcher had the wrong pick up location on my reservation.  I had received an e-mail confirmation two weeks earlier, at the time of booking the reservation, that was correct.  He assured me that problem would be corrected.  When I arrived at ORD, there was no car.  Upon calling the company again, I was advised that the car was waiting at the wrong pick up location.  I was then told a car would be there within 5-minutes.  About 25-minutes later, a car did arrive.  Again, it was a Mercury Grand Marquis with the same impolite driver.   Needless to say, I won't use the service again.  A great price isn't worthwhile if the company's reservationalists and drivers can't communicate and get times and locations correct.
