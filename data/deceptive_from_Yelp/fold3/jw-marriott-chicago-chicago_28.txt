In Chicago for work. My assistant booked the room for me. I was pleased upon arrival. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms are nice. The bar is ok...it was kind of boring but it was during the week. The best part is the location. It is close office and the W hotel is across the street. Overall, a good experience and worth the price. Would definitely stay here again.
