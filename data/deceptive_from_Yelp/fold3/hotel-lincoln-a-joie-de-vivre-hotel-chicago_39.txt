Had the best experience at the Hotel Lincoln this weekend. Absolutely love the location and all of the amenities. We couldn't believe all that the hotel did for our kids in the family suite. The room had a kid size table with coloring books and drawing supplies, there were several board games, trucks, lincoln logs, and sock monkeys for the kids to sleep with. They even included kid size bath robes. The staff made us feel so welcome and offered us up lots of suggestions and things to do. I highly recommend this hotel! And plan to stay there again.
