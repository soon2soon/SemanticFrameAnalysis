Had an awful experience doing the fireworks cruise. We were told to be in line by 9PM or so because the tour would sell out. We arrived around 9PM with a start time of 9:30PM to get a good seat. It was also BYOB as we were told at the last minute. It was around 10PM before our boat arrived. No one was told anything and everyone stood around patiently waiting. So around 10:15 we headed to catch the fireworks at Navy Pier only to find the locks weren't functioning. What are locks and why are they needed? We weren't told, I guess they assumed everyone on board knew everything about boating and the Chicago marina. So we tread water for a half hour or so while the fireworks went off. Once the fireworks were done we moved to the lock area and sat in place for another 15-20 minutes. Again, we weren't told why this was necessary or what it was for. Then around 11 or so we were out on the lake for a half hour or so before we headed back to repeat the lock business. Some people had young kids on board and there were also some older couples that were very tired. The ones that were aware of the BYOB got very drunk (I wish I could have joined them so the time would have gone by faster). Total waste of money and no apology from the company about any of it. F
