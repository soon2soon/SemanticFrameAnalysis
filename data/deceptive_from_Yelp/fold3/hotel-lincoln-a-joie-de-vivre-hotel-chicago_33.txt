Looking out my window and watching it snow in Lincoln Park.  Just arrived to the hotel and this place is wonderful.  Doorman out front ran down the street with his umbrella to make sure I didn't get wet from the snow as I arrived!  Thought that was an awesome touch....Not something that can be trained...Nice People are a rarity in customer service and chivalry!
