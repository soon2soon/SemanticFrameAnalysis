We used Limiotainment as transportation to or sorority formal this past April. The bus arrived early for pick up and took us on a great ride through the city of Chicago. Everything was perfect as promised, and the company even though in complimentary champagne. Everyone who went on the bus had a great time, including myself. It was easily the highlight of the night and I strongly recommend this company.
