The hotel is very beautiful. When walking into the lobby it is absolutely beautiful. Costumer service was not very good, but not bad either. Rooms: were okay. When walking into the hotel you also expect fantastic rooms, however that isn't so. The rooms are good, clean but not fantastic like the rest of the hotel.
