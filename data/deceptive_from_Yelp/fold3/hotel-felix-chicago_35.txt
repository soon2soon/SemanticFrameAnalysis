1 star for being clean and in a convenient location. cons: - noisy outside (construction) - noisy airconditioner - other random noises - tiny, tiny rooms. you have about 2.5 feet of room around 3 sides of the bed and that's it, and I got one of the 'bigger' rooms. - no closet. seriously. there is a hook in a small recess in the wall with a curtain to cover it. this 'closet' is barely wide enough for my carry-on suitcase. - horrible WiFi connection. definitely nowhere near 4 stars. Not even 2.
