DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. If you are looking for hotels in Chicago I assure you there are cheaper and better hotels than this crap. My room and all my clothes smelled like weed thanks to the people smoking in the room next to mine. Even though I complained, the staff did nothing about it. Also, I got robbed and again the hotel did nothing about the things that got stolen from my room. Finally, I was sexually harassed by a naked guy with a mask in the hallway. Trust me,stay away from this hotel!!!
