My husband and I used Mark Janus when booking our honeymoon and cannot recommend him highly enough. It's not often that I give 5 stars for the service that I receive, but Mark went above and beyond to make sure that we had a perfect trip. He took the time to really get to know what was important to us, was completely respectful of our budget (he actually helped us find a fantastic option that was under our budget), asked questions that we never would have thought to consider, was extremely knowledgeable about each of the places we discussed and was very honest and reliable. He provided excellent customer service right up until the end.
