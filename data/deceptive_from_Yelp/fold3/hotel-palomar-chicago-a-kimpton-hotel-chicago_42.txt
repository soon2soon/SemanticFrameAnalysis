Treat yourself and stay at the Palomar, it's such a wonderful experience! Background: We blocked rooms there for our wedding (though our wedding was not at the hotel) and the two of us got to stay in a suite for 4 nights at a reduced rate since we were the bride and groom!  It was perfect since it had a large living room and bathroom for getting ready with the bridesmaids and a large bedroom where we could throw all our stuff.  It goes without saying that the rooms are luxurious, there's nothing bad I can say about them at all. Since we were blocking rooms we had a separate contact, Sarah, for all our issues and questions, which was awesome because all I had to do to make reservations was send off a quick email to Sarah and it was done! We had originally booked only 3 nights, but at the last minute decided to check in one day early, AND we asked for an early check-in.  They didn't have a suite available, but they happily put us in a king room at 11 am and let us stay there way past check-out  the next day so we could easily move to our suite. One of the best parts of the Palomar is that they are pet FRIENDLY!  They don't just tolerate pets, they LOVE them.  Our dog stayed with us and received sooo much attention, every doorman, bellhop, and concierge asked us questions about her, petted her, and generally made a big fuss over her - including a welcome bag with a travel food bowel! What really made the stay wonderful was how nice everybody was, and they were really genuinely nice (it they weren't genuine then they were excellent actors).  You really can't ask for more from a hotel - amazing rooms and the friendliest and most helpful staff! Oh! And when we returned to our suite late at night after our wedding....there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for us, with a note from the concierge congratulating us!
