I love but hate Metra. I like the olde timee conductors and or "Trainmen" as some are labeled. I like the smooth cool in summer and toasty in winter cars. I hate the lies of being late do to "Late Arrival of Equipment" code for we're running freight instead of your as$. I love the vintage cars with orange seats and powder green interior. I hate when I have to work late and the trains are 20 minutes behind. MDN / Mayfair to N'brook.
