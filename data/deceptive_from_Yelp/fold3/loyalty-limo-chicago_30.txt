Best bachelor party ever with Loyalty Limo :) I booked a limo with them for a bachelor party, and it couldn't have been better! We got a stretched black H3 Hummer, with champagne onboard and a cooler in the back full of beer (compliments of Loyalty Limo). They had a speaker system hooked up that I could plug my iPod into, so we had music and beer for the whole night. Vince was my contact with them and he was super reliable. I was emailed a couple of days before the party to confirm locations, and then on the day they made sure to get me in touch with the driver (who was also courteous) and let me know when he was on the way. My booking was for 8 hours so we had quite a bit of time in the limo, and were travelling to many locations (i.e. bar hopping) but there was no fuss with the driver, and we got to every location without any issue :) The reviews on Yelp were the deciding factor for me choosing a limo service in downtown Chicago, and I'm glad I chose Loyalty. They were reliable, reasonable, and most of all fun, so I could not recommend these guys more highly! Cheers gents for a bachelor party to remember!
