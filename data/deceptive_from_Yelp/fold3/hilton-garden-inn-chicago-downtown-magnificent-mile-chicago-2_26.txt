Great location and good value. Was overall happy with the room which was clean and had lovely views of Chicago. Concierge staff were very accommodating and friendly; they assisted us with changing our room when we had different needs. The only issue we had on our visit was lazy valet staff who fell asleep on the job in some small office. However this was dealt with by other staff members and I would return to this hotel in the future.
