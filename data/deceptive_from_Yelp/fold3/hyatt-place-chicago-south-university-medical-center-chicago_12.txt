I was so happy that they opened a hotel in the Hyde Park area. It's so nice not to do the drive downtown. It's a lovely quaint hotel with an excellent staff. I stayed there with my husband and son and the room was large enough that we weren't all on top of each other. We went out for lunch and returned and my key card didn't work. Not a problem because the staff took care of it.
