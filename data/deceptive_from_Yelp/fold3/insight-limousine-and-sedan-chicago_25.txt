My experience with Insight Limo & Jorge couldn't have been better! After initially booking a different limo company & learning via Yelp that they have a habit of not showing up on time (if at all) and frequently charge random fees onto your credit card, I was frantic to find a limo to take 8 of us to a concert the next night.  I called about 10 limo services and found they were either booked or charging exorbitant rates.  Enter Jorge - he was completely friendly and professional from the minute he answered the phone & his rates were affordable!  After telling him my situation and where we needed to go, he informed me that he had one car available & would drive us himself (he's also the owner).  Since he knew we were going to a concert, he let me know that his limo has an Ipod dock, so bring whatever music we want...he also said he'd stock the car with beer and ice & asked if I had any specific beverage requests.  So far, so good! Fast-forward to the next night - Jorge arrived early with car stocked as promised.  When we arrived at the music venue, he pulled up to the front of the venue and parked for as long as possible so we could 'hang out & enjoy our drinks' before going in, despite several demands from the 16 yr. old 'security guards' that he move.   At the end of the concert, Jorge was where we expected him.  When we got into the car, we were surprised/excited to see that he had gotten us a cheese/snack tray while we were inside...just what we needed after a long evening out!  That is outstanding customer service!   We made it home quickly & safely and Jorge happily put up with our obnoxious, impromptu sing along for 45 minutes of our drive..needless to say, we made sure to give him a hefty tip.  I cannot speak highly enough of this company and Jorge, he really made our evening a great experience.  We will definitely use them again & you should too!
