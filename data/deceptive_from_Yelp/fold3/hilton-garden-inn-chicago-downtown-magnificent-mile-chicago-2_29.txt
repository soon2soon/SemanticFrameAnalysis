We spent a Saturday night here before a cruise, then came back two weeks later and spent another night. Easy to find and a good price. Free parking and free wifi. One of the nights we had a king bed the next we had 2 queens. Both beds had nice linens and were very comfortable. The frig and microwave in each room were convenient but the gourmet coffee and tea were a big plus. A very nice breakfast available in the mornings. We had delicious dinners both nights. All of this is great but the real standout for us at this Hilton Garden Inn was the staff! They went out of their way to make us happy. They were so friendly!! Standouts were ROSIE at the front desk and BRIDGET in the restaurant. We had been in contact with Rosie before we arrived and she even stopped on her way to work to pick up an item we needed for our cruise! Now that is service! When we returned after 2 weeks Bridget remembered us and we had another fun conversation. I would come back to Tampa just for the great service staff!!
