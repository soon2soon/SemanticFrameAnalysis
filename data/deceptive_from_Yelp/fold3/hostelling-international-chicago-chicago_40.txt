I stayed at this hostel on a recent trip, due to not be able to stay with a friend. I was a little reluctant but was very pleasantly surprised by the experience. I had only stayed at a hostel twice before and both times were a nightmare. Not the case this time. The staff was friendly and helpful. When I decided I wanted to stay an extra night, the girl behind the desk did everything she could to help me and managed to find an empty bed even though they will booked almost to capacity. The rooms were large and clean. The showers are a little on the small side but not bad. You have to swipe your key to get into the building after 9PM, and again to use the elevator, so the building is secure. The hostel organizes day trips and things for visitors, which seemed to draw a large amount of people looking to explore the city. If you are familiar with the city, the location is perfect right in the Loop. It's very close to Museum Campus, Millenium Park, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain and the Sears Tower Getting around is very easy as well. It's a block and a half from the Brown/Orange/Pink lines and two blocks from the Red Line. If I needed a place to stay in the city in a pinch, I would absolutely stay here again. I highly recommend it to anyone who is traveling to Chicago.
