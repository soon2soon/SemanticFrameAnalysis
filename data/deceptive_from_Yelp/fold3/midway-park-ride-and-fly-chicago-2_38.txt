I had used Park Ride & Fly in the past. The service I thought was OK.  The shuttle wasn't as quick as they advertised and it took a while to drive 2 miles with all the traffic!!  Then I realized that they charge more if your only there for a couple days. I had a quick business trip and only parked for a day.  I was charged $9.25/day + $7.50 tax= $16.75!!    I couldn't believe tax for one day was almost what it cost me just to park!! (which is why I had to give them 1 star!) I wasn't very happy. The time before, I was there 2 days and was charged $14/day after tax. Then a few weeks ago I heard about a place called Midway EZ Parking from a friend & that they were having a special rate on their Facebook of $10/day tax included!!  I thought, "you can't beat that", and gave it a try. Long story short...I LOVED IT!!!  You just pull into their garage they give you a ticket, help load your luggage into their (very nice looking) shuttles, and drop you off right at the terminal door (10 mins from pull up to airport! & their only a few blocks away).  Coming home I just called them and they were there within 5 mins! Park Ride & Fly has ok service, they over charge for taxes...which is ridiculous!!! I HIGHLY recommend Midway EZ Parking instead!!  It's cheaper & much Faster!  :)  I was impressed with their service.  There $10/day Facebook deal is still going on so it's a perfect time to give them a try.
