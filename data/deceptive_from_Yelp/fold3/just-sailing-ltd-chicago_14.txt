I recently purchased the opportunity to go sailing for my boyfriend's birthday. It was a great experience and Justin was very easy-going about rescheduling and departing late. It was also a great way to see the city and I'd highly recommend the night trip (5-8 pm) because you get both a light, sun-setting and night view; which makes for some great pictures! Would love to do this again when family/friends are in town!
