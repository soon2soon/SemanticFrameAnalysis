I had a short stay but the desk staff were friendly and helpful. I got great insight about the city and they were able to recommend sites tailored to my interests. Varied breakfast choices for those with diet restrictions, clean rooms.. Plenty of plush towels.. And to top if off, 5 hours into the drive home i realized i had forgotten my passport in the room before i checked out. They found it and used my account to fedex it back home! Was an interesting story at the Canadian border but LaQuinta really set the pace for, and then rescued my trip. I will be back.
