I want to say the I have booked many trips with Elissa through this company and she is sweetest most professional person I have delt with. I would highly recommend Elissa to all my friends and family!! I think Elissa is capable of Â having her own travel agency one day!! She always gets back with me promptly and has patience when I am confused on what I really want. If I was in this business she would be #1 on my list. Please take this into consideration and don't let her slip through your fingers. Sincerely, Susan J Mathews 317-849-9106
