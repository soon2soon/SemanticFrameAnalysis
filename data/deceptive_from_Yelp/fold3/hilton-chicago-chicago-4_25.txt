Staying here right now . Was up all night due to all the nosie . Water pipes , Trains etc. Spent hours trying to resolve their over booking issues leaving serval friends of ours displaced. I came to find out that they knew what was going to happen before we got there . Left the mess for the night manger to sort out . The Rooms or from the 70's - Bathrooms are very small and the fack gold finish on everything is peeling off . And the Beds are the worst every !!! . Time to take the wreaking ball to place so much lipstick on this pig.
