Excellent hotel for business or casual travel in Chicago. Attractive lobby, well-organized and fast check-in process, great rooms - clean, well maintained, large, big bathrooms, fast and reliable internet, large TV, crisp bed-sheets - it all just works very well. Professional and courteous staff. Great location as well - lots of shoppiing a few blocks away (Macy's and Nordstroms, for example are 10-15 min walk) and right in the business district. Good food, and laundry service. Didn't try the spa or gym. Beats the vast majority of business hotels anywhere but in Asia.
