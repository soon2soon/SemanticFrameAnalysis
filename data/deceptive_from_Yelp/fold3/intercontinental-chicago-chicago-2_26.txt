Boo InterContinental Chicago! Stayed here the night before the Chicago marathon a couple of weeks ago. This hotel TOTALLY takes advantage of its guests on this particular weekend, with outrageous rates and very poor accommodations. I arrived with a weary family (husband and two sons ages 9 and 11) after a soccer tournament. At check-in, we were told the only rooms left had one bed. Since it would be impossible for the 4 of us to sleep in one bed and I needed some sleep, we got a cot. My husband slept on the cot and got a spider bite on the back of his leg. One of my sons slept on the floor and killed several spiders. By the way, we stayed on the 19th floor. We brought the boys down to the indoor pool and had to push a dead roach out of the way where they were playing. There was no Comcast cable so we couldn't watch the Hawks game going on down the street. We had to pay for Internet even though we already paid nearly $300 for our room and $65 for parking. I had to pay $40 for the crappy bagel breakfast they offered the runners. There was a big sign in front of the elevators re: a shuttle to and from the marathon for the runners. But when I went down to the lobby and asked, nobody at the front desk knew anything about a shuttle. I am so disappointed with our experience. The only benefit is that the location of the hotel is fairly close to the start/finish line. Still, I will save the hundreds and hundreds of dollars next year and drive in the morning of the race. Shame on you InterContinental Chicago for robbing your guests!!!!
