I LOVED this hotel!!!!  One of the best decorated in my opinion, modern and hip, like another reviewer said, "I wish I could have that furniture in my house too!"  Loved the bathroom, the bellman was so polite when there was a mistake with the room and promptly got us a room with two beds, great service!
