11/8/14 I was throwing a bachelor party for my buddy and was in need of a party bus for transportation. I heard of limotainment through a friend and decided to check them out. After working with them and setting up a itinerary for the night. I was very pleased with the driver, bus, price, and over all service. This is my recommendation to use limotainment. Thanks Mike.
