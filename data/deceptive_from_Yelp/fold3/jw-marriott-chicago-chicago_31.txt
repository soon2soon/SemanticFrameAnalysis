Beautiful hotel with only small check in glitch.  Stayed here mid April for my son's birthday.  We had theater tickets and location was good.  At check in asked about an upgrade to suite and was denied free upgrade, gentleman stated only one suite left and that it must be purchased.  Then asked about paid upgrade, suddenly another employee appears and opens book.  There are 7 suites open.  Okay, I don't expect free although at platinum member it has happened but would be nice to be told truth up front -  Yes, we have paid upgrades but no courtesy upgrades.   I really did not mind paying as we paid $200 with tax.  Much less than if I had booked up front.  Just nice to hear the truth to begin with. Now the good - our corner suite was fantastic.  My son thought we were wealthy this weekend.  From the double door opening to the dream bathroom with soaker tub and multi-jetted shower in marble.  Everything was truly beautiful.  Service was great and the concierge very helpful. The gym is first class.  With both nautilus type machines and free weights my son was in heaven.  There is also a pliates/ dance studio and steam room.   What can you say ... great place!!!
