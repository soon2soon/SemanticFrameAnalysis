Last summer I ended up getting hosted in IHSP Chicago hostel. When I arrived the giant black men in the front desk dove me to other building down street. The dorm was very private. When I arrived I saw everything pretty clean and there wasn't anyone else than me. There was a bunk and I decided to sleep in the bottom bed. The next day I went to IHSP kitchen to have a cake and coffee and the hostel staff told me I had to leave because my bed was already booked. I have to admit I arrived to chi town without any booking nor reservation. Afortunately I found this hostel for the first night. If I do have something to criticize in this place is the service in the counter.. Honestly the folks are always doing anything else. But I loved the places around, and it's almost one step of the DAMEN CTA. I don't know if the noise in the night while sleeping is too loud, remember I slept one block down street. But definitively I loved the spaces, location, pancakes'n syrup, coffee, Internet and young people there. I will go back to Chicago this spring and will repeat at this place. This time I already got my booking and will use the free shuttle service from the ariport*
