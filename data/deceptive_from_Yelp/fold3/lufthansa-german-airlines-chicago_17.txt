Recently my wife and kids flew Lufthansa (Chicago-Frankfurt-Bangalore).  Prior to complaining, I would like to state the Candaian regional call center was very good, and also the check-in crew in Chicago were excellent.  They offered both friendly service, and accurate information. However, the in flight staff on both routes(Chicago to Frankfurt; Frankfurt to Bangalore) were horrible. The in-flight crew were hardly responsive, and were not pleasant, even to the kids.   The food was bad, and passengers asking for things (like ketchup, mustard etc.) were met with rude responses.   If you are planning to fly internationally, never take Lufthansa.  We have flown multiple international flights.  The best has been Emirates.  Their economy class equals many other airlines' First Class (not the business class). It is a disgrace.
