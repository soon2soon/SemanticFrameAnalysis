Excellent driving, excellent driver and a nice clean limo would be good-enough qualifications for a Limo company to some...But Limotainment went way beyond expectations. The space itself is quite large. I never felt like I was stepping all over people to move around the bus. The sound system is amazing and they have an easy-to-use media interface to operate and be your own DJ. They have ample bar space that made it easy for our group to chill our drinks. A definite must-use limo service for my next occasion.
