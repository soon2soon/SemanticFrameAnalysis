Awesome place !!!i will go there again....i was skeptical about staying in hostel for 4 days.I went to HI in October 2012....Well,i should say it was an awesome experience. It was clean,cheap,nice,comfy and with complimentary breakfast.Its in the heart of downtown ...i loved my stay in CHICAGO.....i am going to Chicago again ;)
