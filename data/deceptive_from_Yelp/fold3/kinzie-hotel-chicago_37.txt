I stayed at this hotel for the IL Â Chicago and it was a wonderful experience. The staff is all very friendly, helpful and accommodating. The beds were awesome and comfyIt was very clean and quiet and we loved the outdoor fire pits in the bar to enjoy the beautiful weather at night. All in all, a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.
