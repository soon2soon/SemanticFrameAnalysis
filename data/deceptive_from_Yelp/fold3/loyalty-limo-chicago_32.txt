We hired Loyalty Limo Services for a bachelorette party last week in Chicago. We didnt buy the package deal but the owner still gave us the red carpet for a nominal price and a complimentary bottle of champagne. This is awesome service. The driver was patient enough to give us a ride downtown before dropping us off. I would love to use Loyaly Limo again.
