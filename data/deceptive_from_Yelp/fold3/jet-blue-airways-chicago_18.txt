Absolute worst flight experience ever. Will never fly with Jet Blue again. Here's why: Flight 926 on 12/27 from Chicago (ORD) to Boston (BOS) was delayed by more than 3 hours because of weather in New York (JFK), which is where our plane was coming from. I understand that this happens, but all reports that I have read indicate that La Guardia and Newark experienced lengthy delays because of wind, but JFK experienced only minor delays. Flights on other airlines from ORD to JFK were not delayed at this time. This leads me to believe that though weather may have played a contributing factor, it should not have caused a 3+ hour delay. By blaming 'weather', Jet Blue doesn't have to compensate passengers for the delay. I believe that a crew shortage really caused the delay. After waiting 3+ hours, we finally boarded the plane and started taxi-ing to the runway, only to turn around and taxi back to the gate. We were informed that our captain who met up with the crew in New York was not allowed to fly because he just hit his 16-hour mark. We had to wait while another pilot who happened to be a passenger on our flight got his paperwork, switched with the pilot, and flew us to Boston. This added an additional 45 minute delay. This is something that Jet Blue should have figured out long before we started taxi-ing to the runway. Additionally, according to the Jet Blue Passenger Bill of Rights: For customers whose flight is delayed 3 hours or more after scheduled departure, JetBlue will provide free movies on flights that are 2 hours or longer. This was never offered to us. Finally, to top off this terrible experience, our bags were put on the wrong plane. I was supposed to land in Boston at 9:30pm. At 1:15am I was standing in a line to fill out a baggage claim because Jet Blue couldn't get our bags on the right flight. I filed a complaint with Jet Blue, but I'm not confident they will respond. What a disaster for what should have been an easy flight.
