I enjoyed staying in this hotel so much that I decided to give reviews of this hotel to Google, Tripadvisor and Yelp. This hotel has the greatest service I have ever experienced from any hotel. From the day one, I was impressed with their willingness to help in any way. They have very clean and spacious rooms. When you drive to hotel, there is valet person waiting to take your car. You can scan the receipt to get your car ready when you are ready from your room. They have a lot of things that you may forget to bring to the trip and you can borrow or purchase with small fee. Every single person I dealt with in this hotel was pleasant and friendly. One morning, I overslept and missed their continental breakfast and called if I could still eat breakfast just in case. The gentelman said he will grab something for me. When I came down, he had a bag of food ready to go. When I opened the bag in my room, I was totally impressed. Freshly cut fruit, pancakes, eggs and more-beautifully arranged as well. That was just one example of the good services I had in my 4 days stay. You can tell right away that they take customer service VERY seriously. having lots of good restaurants in walking distance is a bonus.
