I've tried so many Chicago hotels and something always disappoints. The boutique hotels have become pretentious while under-delivering which is annoying. Not so at Hotel Monaco. Every staff member we encountered was delightful and helpful; the room (708) was sparkling clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated - love the high ceilings; the dining room - South Water Kitchen - is fantastic and they cooked my eggs perfectly (which is a quirky big deal for me); they serve Intelligentsia coffee which I love; the evening wine service by the fireplace in the lobby was lovely; workout facility was spacious, clean and had brand-new Life Fitness treadmills and a fully stocked water bottle mini-fridge (also a strange quirk of mine); and, finally, the window seats in the room overlooking the city were charming, unique and cozy. I will be back!
