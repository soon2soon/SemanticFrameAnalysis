This is a fabulous hotel.  The staff is wonderful and very helpful, including the doormen.  The rooms are very quiet with none of the usual too frequent Chicago taxi honking to be heard.  The rooms are clean, the beds are comfy, and its nice to have those wild bathrobes available to use. The air conditioning is quiet, too, which is a blessed relief.  My only complaint is the lack of coffee machines in the rooms.  There is free coffee available in the lobby, but I prefer to have mine without having to go out in public in the morning.  Otherwise, the hotel is perfect.
