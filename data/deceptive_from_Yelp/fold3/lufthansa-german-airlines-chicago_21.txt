I have flown Lufthansa five or six times and the in-flight service has been always excellent. That said, however, every time there was a surprise with my baggage.  Once, I was asked to empty my carry-on bag contents and put them in their box and check the box even though I had carried my bag in my international flight that connected with the Lufthansa flight.  More recently (first week of August 2014), I was flying from Munich to Chicago and was asked to check in my carry-on bag.  I pointed out to the Munich ticket counter lady that I had flown in by Air Canada which did not have any problem with my carry-on bag and that the baggage rules for the onward flight apply to the return flight (it's at the Air Canada website), but it was of no avail.  The lady insisted that I check my carry-on because Lufthansa rules were different (more restrictive) that Air Canada rules!  In general, Lufthansa ticket counter workers in Europe - in Frankfurt, Lisbon, Budapest and Munich) - in my experience, have been unfriendly at best and rude and uncaring at worst.  The service on-board - I keep my fingers crossed - is still excellent, particularly when I compare with British Airways, American, etc.  If only Lufthansa could improve service and attitude of personnel at airport counters, it would be a great air line.
