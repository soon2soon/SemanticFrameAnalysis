"GREAT PLACE TO STAY" My wife and I stayed at the  hotel Monaco this past week  in the celebration of our 3 year wedding anniversary. The staff atthis hotel were helpful and kind .They do everything they can to make our stay in our "second home", comfortable. The hotelis well maintained. The hotel is convenient , the price is just right and we had no problem finding our way around the shoppingstreets.
