Lufthansa, Here are some reasons I will be trying very hard to avoid you the next time I travel. 1) You displayed a lack of concern for elderly and infirm travellers. We (everybody-including people who couldn't stand for minutes leave alone, hours) stood in a line for about a hour and a half waiting to get through security and no one came through to see if there were people among us that needed assistance/priority. The infirm among us just endured, somehow. The several that had tight connections had to beg their way to the head of the line and then were confronted with a very rude baggage screener  at Frankfurt who yelled at a passenger for picking up a try out of turn (check your CC cameras you will see the outburst on the 4th of December  2014 about 1-3PM). 2) You displayed a lack of concern for elderly and infirm travellers (again). We had all missed our connections owing to a weather event (not your problem, I agree, but You displayed a lack of concern for elderly and infirm travellers-this does not change-I hope you see the pattern) We stood in a line for a couple of hours, even though there were several of us who need not have been there. They were exclusive country passport holders who could have gone to other service counters and lightened the load on the cattle-class lines, but no one cared enough to check until hours later when it dawned on some of you. And when we did get to the head of the line, we got a very nice agent who helped us rebook on a flight 24 hrs later, but a fellow traveller had an encounter with a rude agent. 2) You displayed a lack of concern for travellers with small children who had to spend the night in the airport. We were left to our own devices to figure out how to spend about 24 hours in a airport with meal coupons a blanket and a pillow. These are adequate for able travellers with a poor sense of smell and hygiene and titanium backs but not for single mothers with two little kids. 29th Dec 2014
