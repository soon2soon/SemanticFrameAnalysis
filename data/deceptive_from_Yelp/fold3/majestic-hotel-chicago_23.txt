My husband and I stayed here with his brother and wife on vacation to check out IL and go to a Lakers game. It was a very nice and clean hotel. We did have to drive quite far to any of the events we wanted to go to but if I needed to be in that area of IL, I would considering staying there again. Good times there though.
