I just stayed here this past weekend, and don't usually do hostels as i'm pretty picky.  Stayed in a private suite with 3 others.  108 total - just over $25 each and the place was OUTSTANDING. Clean, well managed, very friendly and helpful, amazingly located.  I will stay here every time i visit Chicago.  Maybe the marathon next year again :)
