Apparently no one is on site. Not going to use for my out of town guests in the future. My cousin and her husband arrived and could not even get into the building. This after their reservation was confirmed and the charge made on their card. Â Their access code to the building and the room was supposed to have been emailed to them, but was not by the time they arrived. Other guests let them in the building, but they were dying to use the restroom after a long drive and could not get in their room. Multiple message were left on voicemail and then someone finally showed up by chance and was not even apologetic! No hospitality/welcome/warmth and no bargain for $170 a night.
