BIG SERVICE from a small hotel!  The concierge are true professionals here. They listened and helped us pick places to eat and visit.  They printed directions instead of telling us.  They comped parking in their own valet lot after my truck was broken into an unaffiliated garage nearby (10 E Ontario, beware).  The staff makes this hotel excellent.  I'll be back.
