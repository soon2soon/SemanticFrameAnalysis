Wow!  What a great hotel experience.  From the time we pulled up and was greeted by the porter we knew this was not an ordinary hotel.  The staff is friendly, remembered who we were each time we saw them, offered assistance with directions and suggestions of what to see and do locally.  The room was very spacious, the bed very comfortable, and the bathroom was large with a jacuzzi tub.  Looking forward to our next stay!
