Mike and his driver Priest provided excellent service for our crew. We had a bachelor party from the city to Arlington Park. The bus/van was in excellent shape with a great sound system (ipod docking) and loaded with beer. We were a roowdy (but fun) crew and Priest could not have been more laid back and reasonable. Very affordable and would highly recommend. TG
