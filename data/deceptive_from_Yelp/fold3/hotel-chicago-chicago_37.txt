Hotel Sax Chicago ROCKS!!!!   What an amazing experience I had at this hotel.  The coolest part was the technology lounge called the The Studio experience by Microsoft.  After reading a short blurb about this hotel, I went to hotelsaxchicago.com and it knocked my socks off!  What drew me in was The Studio.  I was looking for a new experience, a get away from the norm and I found it.  The Studio is an entertainment lounge filled with Microsoft technology.  It has leather chairs, suede couches and comfy pillows everwhere.  My partner and I played XBox, listened to music on their Zunes, played Guitar Hero and watched a movie.  All for free!!  Needless to say, we did not see much of Chicago that weekend.  But, we will be back!
