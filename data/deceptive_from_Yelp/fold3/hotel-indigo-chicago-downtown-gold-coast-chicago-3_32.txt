Super cute hotel with friendly staff. Room was bright and clean. Loved the blueberry wallpaper. This was a birthday gift to a friend and she totally loved it. The room was bigger than I expected it to be and comfortable beds. Great location for getting to where we needed to be. Don't get breakfast at the restaurant if you're hungry, it will be a long wait due to little staff. However, the coffee was amazing and I'm picky about my strong coffee.
