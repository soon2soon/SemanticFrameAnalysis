My husband stayed on Oct. 5,6 and 7th as part of the MARS, Make The Difference Semi-final competion and award ceremonies.(MTD). We are both employees of Wrigley Gainesville. We had a great time; but on the 7th Mars planned a breakfast cruise for us and we had to check out early leaving our bags in the Hotel's care. While our bags were in theHotel's care we were victims of theft. We picked up our bags and went straight to the airport and our bags were almost 10 lbs lighter leaving Chicago than they were when we came. We both thought we were imagining things and arrived home to find our belongings missing. We called the Hotel immediately and finally spoke to someone in loss prevention on the 10th. She told us if there is no video oh well so sorry. Three couples were with us and two of the three had their bags rummeged through, but nothing taken. Our trip was great until out stuff was taken and it's been over a week and we have heard nothing. I will never stay at another JW Marrott hotel and I hope MARS never books with another one.
