The Majestic was an awesome, comfortable place to stay.  Great Wrigleyville location, close to the lake.  The room we had was not tiny as other reviewers have remarked on.  Also, the parking was very convenient considering the location!  Staff was super friendly and helpful, with awesome recommendations for food and drinks.  Great lake side walk is right across LSD, and the neighborhood is clean and safe.  I will definitely stay there next time!!!
