My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Sax for 1 night while visiting Chicago... Overall 4/5 stars in my book. Pros: *Great price due to the economy *$42 parking was included for our package *Very nice aesthetics throughout the hotel, lobby, rooms, etc. *Rooms were nice and stylish, comfortable beds *Right next to the House of Blues, 10-Pin Bowling and Bin 36 *Their own Crimson Lounge is nice, though I'm not big on drinking *Right by Michigan Ave. *Right by Shaws Crabhouse where we had dinner (EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT place to eat) *Interactive entertainment lounge with every current video game system hooked up to LCD/plasma tvs, including a rock band instrument set and BEER available... Cons: *We were given a double room, instead of one with a single bed that I booked (we were tired when we got in so we didn't care... I'm sure this could have been fixed). *No baths in our standard room, just a shower, in case you cared or wanted to relax and have one. *Kind of dim halls, I didn't know if this was meant for ambience or not. *Interactive game room closes too early (though I'm sure my wife wouldn't want us playing video games on our hotel). For an average guy like me, this is a very nice hotel, at a great location, at a good price. Â I will definitely return here in the future, and recommend it to others, especially if you want to catch a show at the House of Blues right next door.
