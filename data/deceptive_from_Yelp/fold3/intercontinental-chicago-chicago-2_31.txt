Everything about this so-called 4 &1/2 star hotel was disappointing to say the least. I've been to better motels off interstate highways; needless to say with much better prices. This hotel is overrated at best and does NOT deserve to carry the Intercontinental name. The decor is reminiscent of a circus, and looks like it hasn't been changed since the early 70s. Lighting in the rooms was poor and the windows were dirty...I was switched to another room and the same applied to both. If you're thinking about parking at this hotel, FORGET IT! You'll be much better off leaving your car at a nearby parking garage. At $57 + tax per day, parking is clearly a rip off. The best thing about this hotel is the fact that its lobby connects to Starbucks (and their free wifi). If you're going to spend money to stay on the Magnificent Mile, spend it elsewhere unless you're 100% sure that this place has undergone some SERIOUS renovations AFTER 01-01-2013!
