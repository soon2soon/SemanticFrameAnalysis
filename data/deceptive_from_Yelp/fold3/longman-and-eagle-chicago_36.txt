Look, the food is very good, excellent in fact. There are obviously some very creative, talented people in the kitchen who turn out some high quality dishes in a tight space each and every night. Not easy to do but they have eeked out a very healthy trade in an off the beaten path spot. Also received a Michelin, no mean feat. I dined there for the fourth time last night. My minor gripe is with the response to a simple straightforward request. I asked for a side of the Duck Fat Fries with my main, which I have had before and they said NO ! Its in the kitchen so why would he not serve it? Somewhat disappointing and kind of a buzz killer. But I still got over it and enjoyed my evening. So I ordered the Burger on the side just so I could get the duck fat fries. I got my fries in the end but a frustrating exercise. I had the scallops for the App which were tasty good, great flavours and the Duck 3 ways which was also superb. So please be a little (just a little please) more obliging and give me the Duck Fat Fries the next time without having to order the burger. But high marks on atmosphere, creativity, ingenuity. I would definitely go back for the food again which continues to impress me and will just have to cajole or barter the fries outta him. Btw... the bartender who served me also helped save the day. He was gracious, hospitable, well informed and apologised profusely.
