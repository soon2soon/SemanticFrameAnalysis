4 friends and I went on a "girls only weekend getaway" from NY to Chicago.  We wanted to try to see and do as much as possible in a short period of time.  I think we succeeded, but one of the highlights of our stay was the walking tour with Joyce.  We did the magnificent mile/gold coast tour and Joyce was extremely informative and it added so much to our trip.       I just want to add that my daughter and her friends also went on a walking tour with Joyce when they were in Chicago over New Years week. They also absolutely loved her and they were the ones who recommended her  to us.  I can therefore say that whether you are in your 20's or 50's Joyce is amazing and you will have a great time.
