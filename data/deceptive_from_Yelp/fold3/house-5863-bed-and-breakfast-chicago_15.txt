Extremely well appointed facility. Very modern furnishings. Nice food selection in the open, self serve kitchen. Comfortable Beds. Very nicely remodeled - just would have been nice if they had added sound insulation between the rooms.  I could hear EVERY word the person in the next room was saying.  Very annoying. Convenient Location with plenty of restaurant choices within walking distance. Parking is a hassle. If you find a good spot - don't move your car.
