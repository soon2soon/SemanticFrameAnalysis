I feel rejuvenated and relaxed after a facial and mani-pedi at Dorina's Spa. I've also noticed that my nails last longer than at other spas. She takes her time and does quality work rather than rush you through. She has a wide selection of colors, and Â I love the ones she recommends. To top it off sinking into her comfortable chairs adds to the pleasurable experience
