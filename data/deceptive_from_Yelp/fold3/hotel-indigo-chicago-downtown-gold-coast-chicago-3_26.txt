I booked this through priceline and at first I thought it was a great deal until I got to the hotel. The rooms were small and electronics rather out of date. The only good thing was the decoration, though you could tell they definitely needed to remodel a few things. Because the rooms were rather cramped, I decided to book another room for my party but was severely overcharged. The staff became rather hostile and unhelpful when I tried to negotiate with them. There were also some security issues that this place needs to address (it's really easy to get a hold of key cards for strangers to come in to the hotel) Also, my friend stepped on a random piece of broken glass that wasn't cleaned up from the previous person's stay, and spent the majority of the night attending to her gash. I also ripped off my finger nail trying to open up their window since their a/c and heating system is really bad. I thought this would be a good experience, but boy was I extremely disappointed.
