My husband gave me a trip to Chicago for my birthday. I had the hardest time deciding on a hotel. After reading the reviews, it seemed that everyone loved Hotel Monaco. I can see why. We splurged and got a king deluxe room with a view of the Chicago river. We also had a view of Trump Towers and the Wrigley Building. The window seat everyone talks about is actually very cool. It was fun to sit in the window and watch the boats go down the river. I told the person that checked me in that we were celebrating my birthday. When we got back from dinner the first evening, we had a bottle of champagne and a note from her telling me happy birthday! How cool is this?  Also, if you are a member of the Kimpton hotel group, you get free wifi! I am a gold memboer of Marriott, and I don't get free anything. This hotel treated us like we were the Cat's meow. I loved the fun robes they had. This place screams FUN!  Different!  Everyone that worked here seemed happy from the front desk to the house keeping staff. I just loved this hotel. They differentiate themselves from the rest. I highly recommend splurging for the river view with the window seat. It makes being in your room almost as much fun as going out!  We shall be back!
