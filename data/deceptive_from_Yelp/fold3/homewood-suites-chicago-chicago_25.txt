Hilton knows how to do it right. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to the museums, theaters and entertainment venues. The room is big and the kitchen is well stocked with utensils. I especially like the rooftop indoor pool which has great views of the Chicago skyline. The CTA Red Line is also only a block from the hotel.
