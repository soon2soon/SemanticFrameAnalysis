I booked a 20-room block at this hotel for the night before and night of my wedding. The hotel is gorgeous, the rooms were beautiful, and the staff is amazing. I can't say enough about how kind and accommodating everyone was. Even though we didn't host our wedding or reception there, an events coordinator was still in touch several times leading up to that weekend to make sure everything from room groupings to guest bags worked out perfectly. If you need a block of rooms for an event, I can't recommend the JW Marriott highly enough.
