We are big Hilton customers so we stay at many different Hilton properties. Overall, we were disappointed in the quality of our experience.  First, at check-in, we had to deal with an unfriendly woman at the front desk named Adilla. She did not properly greet us. She only said, "I can help you over here."  She also never smiled, and she simply handed us our room keys after check-in without saying anything or making eye contact.  This is not the way that you greet customers at check-in so staff members like this need to be trained more effectively and/or supervised more effectively. Also, a Hilton Honors members, we were supposed to receive complimentary bottles of water, but we were told that the hotel "did not have any." The room was okay, but we had an issue with a room service order.  We completed a breakfast pre-order card and left it outside our door, but security never picked it up. Room service was very apologetic the next morning and they filled the order quickly. Overall, our stay at this property did not meet our expectations and we do not plan to come back.  It is worth it to pay more for a nicer property like The Drake, or the Palmer House.
