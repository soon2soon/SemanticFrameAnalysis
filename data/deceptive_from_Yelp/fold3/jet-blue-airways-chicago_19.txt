WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER TRIED TO FLY WITH!! I say "tried" because they cancelled my flight! I got the stupid Jet Blue pass because it seemed like a great deal, but when my first flight with them was cancelled they would only offer a $50 refund! What a joke! You will wait on hold for 2 hrs for them to say no refunds! Even if they cancell the damn flight the day before I was leaving for my best friends wedding! Now I'm stuck with a $1000 last minute flight! Use any other airline but not JETBLUE!!!!
