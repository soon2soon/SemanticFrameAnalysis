Very disappointing Yelp deal.  Driver to Midway arrived early but, after making a wrong turn or two, had to be reminded how to get to the Stevenson.  He did got us there with no other problems.  Return trip was awful -- called from MDW at 5:55 to get car. Made a second call around 6:05 and was told car would be there in 3 to 5 minutes. Since car hadn't arrived by 6:15, called again and asked what kind of car I should be looking for -- was told a Ford Expedition. Car finally came (Lincoln Navigator!) at 6:20.  25 minutes to get picked up -- could have taken a cab and been home already.
