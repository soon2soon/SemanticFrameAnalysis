Our first family trip to Chicago and we were really stuck on what hotel to stay at.  Our friends gave us suggestions and honestly, this wasn't their first choice.  It wasn't even on the list. After we were not able to find rooms at suggested hotels...we called HGI and booked....we were worried. This hotel staff made this trip an absolute home run!  The hotel is nice, rooms clean, etc.  The staff helped us find our way around the city, suggested places to eat, told us how to navigate public transportation and asked how our days went when we returned.   From the front desk, the valets, bell hop to the cleaning staff, all were exceptional.  When my wife and I go back later in the year, we will be staying here. As far as pricing goes, good value for the money, realizing everything is expensive downtown but I felt we received good value for what we paid.  Pool is a little small but we really didn't go there to swim.  Too much to do and see.
