My wife and I had our wedding here in late August 2014.  I can't express how well it went.  All the guests raved about the food and the venue.  The staff kept things moving along nicely and the view was spectacular.   In other reviews there are criticisms about the construction happening however it was really not an issue. The food at our reception was outstanding.  We had a duet of filet mignon and sea bass which got rave reviews from everyone at the wedding.  As I walked around and greeted people I looked at everyone's plate and somehow they managed to cook almost 200 plates of food wonderfully.  The chef's name is Gabriel Ortega and he deserves any and all praise I can give him. Overall they handled a large wedding very well and exceeded expectations at all times.  I highly recommend it.
