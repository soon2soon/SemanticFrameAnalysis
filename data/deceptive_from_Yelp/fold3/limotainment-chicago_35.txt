I've been on Limotainment a couple times now for a wedding and bar crawl, it was great both times.  The largest bus is great, it's big and clean on the inside, plenty of room to party on.  Priest is also a great driver and makes it fun. I would definitely recommend using limotainment if you need a party bus around Chicago.
