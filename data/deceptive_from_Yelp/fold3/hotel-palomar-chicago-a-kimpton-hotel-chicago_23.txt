If you have ever stayed at another Kimpton owned Hotel, you know that it is a top shelf organization that understands what real customer service should look like.  We have stayed at the Argonaut in San Francisco and that Kimpton property was simply amazing, so we thought we woould stay at the Palomar and celebrate our anniversary there and escape from the kids for a night.   The Palomar was a wonderful Boutique Hotel experience.  The staff is incredibly friendly and very welcoming!  That really sets this place a part from other hotels.  The staff really is terrific!  The hotel has a wonderful decor and has a great vibe to it.  The rooms simply rock.  The beds are amazing and see if you can get a room with a Fuji tub.  It's like your own swimming pool.  The wine reception is always fun and you get to meet some fun people if you are in the mood to talk to others.  The 17th floor terrace has some great views and provides a great area to sit and chat.  The location is also a plus.  We walked to the theatre district and there is plenty of shopping options around the Palomar.   This is one of my favorite hotels and I encourage everyone to check this place out!
