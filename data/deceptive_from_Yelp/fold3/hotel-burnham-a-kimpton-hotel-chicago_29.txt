Beautiful hotel in downtown Chicago , in the center. Nearby, multiple places to eat, dinner and buy what you want for desyuno. There are more modern hotels in Chicago, but after a journey of two weeks for the entire West, sleeping in typical roadside motels, staying at the Â Hotel Burnham, a Kimpton Hotel is in sight and senses a gift. Luxurious entrance, great rooms, true to the style of a few decades, which transports you to the most glamorous Chicago ago. To feel like a star.
