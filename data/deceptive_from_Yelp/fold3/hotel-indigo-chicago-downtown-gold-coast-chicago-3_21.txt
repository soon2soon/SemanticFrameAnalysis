The room was small and cramped, bathroom was in poor shape due to water damage, the door started crumbling when it got stuck on the bath mat. Dust all over the ceiling from the air conditioning vent, and to top it off we were double charged for parking by the hotel and the parking garage next door. Buyer beware.
