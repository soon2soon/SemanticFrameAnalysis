I have been taking the Metra for years as a convenient method of visiting family and friends outside of the city.  To that end I have had plenty of time to witness Metra employees become increasingly crass and inappropriate, now reaching a breaking point in my tolerance spectrum.  The last (5) times I have ridden the Metra I have encountered nasty attitudes, inappropriate conversation and idiotic rational from employees.  Not to mention the stench of urine that CONSTANTLY hangs in the general populous' air supply.  As if this weren't bad enough I suspect it's almost a guaranteed that some bacteria will cling to your nether regions if you so much as consider using the restroom facilities.  As prices climb, service and consideration plummet.  Get it together Metra.  Your location and commuter demand should not give you the right to slack off or retain blatantly rude employees.  From here on out I will start to document the names of said employees on Yelp, if for nothing else than to hold them accountable for their less-than-professional behavior.
