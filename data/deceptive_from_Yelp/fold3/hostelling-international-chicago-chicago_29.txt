I just joined yelp, so this will be my first review. Wonderful! I only took off one star because there was an "overbooking" issue the night we arrived and the front desk man who checked us in (blonde hair, glasses) was not the friendliest about the issue and seemed annoyed we were there. We had to stay the night unsure of where we would stay for the remainder of our reservation. But the next morning the girl (Cheryl) at the front desk was very apologetic and was quick to offer an upgrade for the other nights. I don't understand why that couldn't have been done the night before? But the rest of our stay was lovely. Breakfast was the best we've ever seen at a hostel. Aside from our first night, the staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back next time we are in Chicago. Thank you to Cheryl at the desk (and we saw her working in the kitchen too ha) and the friendly guy in the kitchen.. we forgot his name.
