We had to find a hotel on the spur of the moment because our car broke down and we are from out of state. We walked in and were able to get a room without any problem. It us a charming hotel and the service is really outstanding. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. Â  We would highly recommend this to anyone and definitely stay here again. The neighborhood is really charming as well. The next morning after checkout we had to wait for our car to be looked at by the auto repair shop and they were so considerate and allowed us to relax in their beautiful lobby. Just cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Just plain WONDERFUL!!
