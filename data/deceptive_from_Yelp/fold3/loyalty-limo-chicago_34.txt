The girls just loved the experience with your Limo Service. Vince - You have been very understanding with regards to waiting time, change of schedules etc. The chauffer was absolutely fantastic. He helped the girls take some photographs, was patient enough to wait for them. The red carpet and champagne were awesome. Overall I would give a 5 on 5 rating :)
