I stayed at this great hostel back in December for a few days. From my private room you could see gorgeous downtown Chicago. Great value and very helpful welcoming staff. The lovely young lady at the front desk was extremely helpful and one of the nicest people I have ever met in my life (don't know what her name was but apart from being so nice she was very pretty as well and from Michigan I believe). Keep her guys she is a GEM!!!! No complaints, had an excellent stay and Chicago was beautiful. So sad I had to go back to Miami but oh well.....perhaps this great city might be my home in the future.....
