Vincent really came through for me the night of my birthday. I was driving home from my friends house and said I want a limo tonight for my bday. Vincent made that happen! That 18 passenger Navigator Limo was the business...my family and I had a ball. Our driver was the koolest as well. I will recommend Loyalty Limo to everyone!!!!!!
