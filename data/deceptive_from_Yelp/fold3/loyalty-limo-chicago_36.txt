I used Loyalty Limo for my wedding a few weeks ago and I have no complaints. The service was great, loved that they provided drinks for us, and we could plug in our own music. Our driver was on time picking me and my groomsmen up, he was professional and well-dressed. The limo was perfect for our wedding party and photographers, and our driver got us to all of our photo destinations all around downtown Chicago with no problems. Great company to work with! I would definitely use them again and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for limo rentals.
