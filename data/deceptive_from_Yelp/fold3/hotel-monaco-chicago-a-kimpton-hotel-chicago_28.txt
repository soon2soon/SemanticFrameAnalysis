I will never again choose any other hotel chain than Kimpton after my experience at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago.  The staff has been the most friendly and the most service oriented I have ever encountered at any hotel in any price range on any continent.  They, and the lovely hotel itself, have made a tired traveller (one not so happy with her decision to be in Chicago on a cold, cold December weekend) so very comfortable and happy to be here.  Thank you so much
