I spent about one hour tonight trying to make a reservation for this hotel.  It is stated in their home page, Chill with Parking, Wi-Fi & 20% Off Dining, From $110/night Book Now.  However, when I tried to "book now," the rates were over $250 per night, so I called the number on this home page.  The rep, Maria, put me on hold about four times, then finally stated that she can book the hotel at $274 per night.  This is false advertising, especially when I want to go there as one person and I only need the minimal accommodations, even a single bed would be fine.
