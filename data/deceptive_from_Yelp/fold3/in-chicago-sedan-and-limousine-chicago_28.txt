I was in Chicago last weekend for a wedding and used In Chicago Car Service a couple of times over the weekend. Planning my pick up and drop offs went smoothly, very professional service, super kind and helpful! My drivers were prompt, helpful, and fun to talk to! Will for sure use them in the future, thanks for the incredible experience!
