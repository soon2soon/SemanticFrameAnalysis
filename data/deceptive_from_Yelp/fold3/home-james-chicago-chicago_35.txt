If there was something lower then 1 star i would rate this company that. Unbelievably disgusting service. I was shopping around for a limo service for my wedding. I called this place because it seemed to have outstanding reviews. not sure why AT ALL. A woman picked up the phone, i told her i need a limo service for 7 people for a specific date, and instead of asking questions she kept saying ok ok ok ok ok until i finally snapped on her and told her to ask questions instead of rudely prodding and saying ok every couple of seconds. Thank god this person picked up the phone because if i would have actually been stupid enough to book with this company i would for sure regret it. wow, horrible service. do not recommend that anyone call or book with them.
