I ride this train every day - and it stinks.  They do not have any stations or express trains east of Gary.  Moreover, they are frequently late and do not care if you arrive to home or work after the scheduled time.  They always have some kind of excuse.  If there was a privately owned commuter train, the South Shore would be out of business in a year.  I am tired of my tax dollars going to such an inferior service.
