I was very disappointed with my stay here.  Sure, the location is great but there are about a hundred other options within 1/2 mile and I am guessing (hoping) they are all much better.  The room I had was dark, dark, dark.  Even with all the lights on, I couldn't read a book.  The room was decked out in brown, tan and grey - absolutely no color.  Very depressing.  The worst, though, was the internet.  Very slow.  Forget streaming or loading anything with graphics.  In the entire week I stayed here I never was able to access simple email without the connection freezing up several times.  I was here on business and wasn't able to be productive in my room.  I travel about 20 times a year and my requirements for hotels is pretty simple, if it's clean, I'm good.  Ha!  That's because I've always had sufficient light and good internet access in the past.
