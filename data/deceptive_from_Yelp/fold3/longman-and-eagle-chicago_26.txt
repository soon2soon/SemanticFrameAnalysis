I'm sad to write this review but feel it should be put out into the universe.  On my 2nd visit to Longman & Eagle, there was a STAPLE IN MY GRITS  Yes, a metal, sharp staple that belongs in a stapler or on paper.  Luckily, I was sitting outside on the terrace and the sunlight caught a piece of metal which brought it to my attention before I consumed it.   This is the beginning of the story, unfortunately.  After notifying the waiter and his waiter-in-training of the issue he promptly brought out another serving of grits... and that was about the last we saw of both of them.  It seems we embarrassed them (?) by speaking to the manager on duty, and they never returned to check on our food, if we needed anything else, etc.   Basically the staple was bad, but the way they handled it was worse.  I had to do a lap of the restaurant just to get my bill!!  The manager was nice enough to comp our meal, but also never returned to check on us.  Such a shame!  I will not be returning.... it's simply not good enough to forget this experience.
