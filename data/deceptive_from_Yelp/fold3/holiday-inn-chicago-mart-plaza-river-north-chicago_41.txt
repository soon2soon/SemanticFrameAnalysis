There are so many wonderful hotels in the city of Chicago and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is not one of them! Just last weekend I stayed there with my best friend and her boyfriend and not only was she charged for the room, but I was charged for the room as well! The service was extremely poor, as the staff was rude and was told so many varying stories of when we could check in. Overall, they don't care about making your stay the most enjoyable possible. DO NOT stay here!
