Checked in and they put me in a room facing the city center on the 29th floor, excellent view. Hotel accommodations were great too, staff was very friendly. A little more expensive than what I would have paid personally buy business travel is business travel, right? The hotel is also next to a train station, so that makes getting all the way up to Lincoln Park pretty easy.
