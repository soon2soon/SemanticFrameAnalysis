I am currently planning a two month + in Asia trip and Liberty was a pleasure to work with. I am an independent traveler and I had a certain distain for package deals and the ilk. So when I approached Liberty Travel, I was expecting the worst : never-ending pitches and sales person runaround. However when I talked to Robyn, Â I found it to be a pleasant experience. No pitches, no BS. In fact, Robyn saved me some money by recommending a cheaper travelers insurance (a must for a month + trip). Robyn, who took a similar trip, seemed generally exited for my trip and recommended a few dishes to try in Cambodia. Highly recommended ! The only problem is parking. It's very hard to find a parking space, but it isn't their fault for that. infinity/10 would book with them again
