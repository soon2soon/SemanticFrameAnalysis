Horrible customer servive! They just LOST our booking! Booked flights for 2 people, roundtrip Dusseldorf - San Francisco through Lufthansa official website. First our booking wouldn't accept our payment, not by card, visa, paypal, ... nothing. Had to call the customer service for 3 days, several times a day before we could get a hold of them. Phone numbers not even working... After the 6th call, explaining everything over and over, even the people from Lufthansa didn't know why we couldn't pay. In the end, after 3 days of calling and searching and explaining, payment "worked". Also quite difficult to explain ourselves as people from the callcenter barely spoke English. But then... when we wanted to check our tickets (e-tickets) the next day, none were available. This for about 2 days and the 3rd day, suddenly the Lufthansa website couldn't find our booking number anymore. Had to call the customer service again and apparantly Lufthansa just lost our booking. They couldn't find it anywhere. Not sure what happened exactly, because there was also no money taken from the creditcard, but how can you just LOSE a booking? We've spent quite some money on calling the customer service, which is a special phone nr where you pay a rather high connection fee and now we also had to book new flights (which were more expensive, but with an other airline company because I don't feel like using Lufthansa ever again). I'm sure lots of people have no problem with this airline, but in case something goes wrong with your booking or flight... prepare for the worst, because the customer service doesn't really care about you...
