We toured with Joyce in mid-February around the Pilsen neighborhood. It was very interesting, great street art, historical buildings and a tour of The Mexican Heritage Museum which was great and something I'm sure we would not have done on our own. If you really want to see and experience Chicago beyond the normal scope of the tourist , call Joyce and spend a morning walking through one of the colorful Â neighborhoods - you will love it.
