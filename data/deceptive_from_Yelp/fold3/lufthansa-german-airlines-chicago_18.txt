On this trip I not only flew Lufthansa in business class but Royal Jordanian and El Al. Lufthansa in nearly all points was far below these other airlines. Lufthansa food selection and quality as well as quantity was lacking and was far below these other airlines. There purser was rude and unkind. More worried about getting to the next passenger and keeping it on time for her service schedule than helping passengers. They also severely limited the number of meals of each choice assuring that many passengers would not have their food choice. Their simple reply was we say that on the menu card. I seat was only ok, but I understand that they are now thankfully changing their seats over the next few years. If you have another choice that would work with your schedule I would select another airline.
