I want you to know that as a whole I am done with this company and I advise you to stay away. Me and my wife were stranded by Jet blue in Costa Rica, and we had to pay our way back because of the poor customer service Jet Blue provided us. We were out $900, and the company didn't provide us with any assistance, what so ever. We were pretty much, Â left to our on devices. There customer service in the airport and on-line were rude and offensive. I travel frequently so i know the rules, yet in this one occasion I found it suprising to know how badly you could be treated. This company does not care if you are stranded and will not do anything to help you in return. Sadly I liked Jetblue, but now I highly advise all to STAY AWAY.
