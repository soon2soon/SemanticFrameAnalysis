I had an all day meeting in downtown Chicago, flying in from St. Louis in the morning and back out that evening.  I was going to be in the meeting all day and didn't want to rent a car.  I researched a few car service companies on Yelp and found that Home James Chicago had really good reviews.  So after a few calls that's who I went with. I am definitely happy with the service.  The car was nice and clean.  Our driver was professional and friendly.  He was already waiting for us to be picked up from the airport and picked up from our meeting.  We made it to the meeting on time and back to the airport on time. Next time we fly to Chicago and need a car service I will definitely use Home James Chicago again.  This was my first time ever using a car service so I was a little nervous, but the experience was perfect.
