This place up charges for everything.  I got there and had to use my I pad for something quickly so I paid for the internet service,  Later that evening I had to do some work on my laptop and I found that the internet charge of about $15 was per device.  So I ended up paying $30 for internet service in one day.  I found out the next morning my coworker had gone to work out in their work out room and they tried to charge her for that. My other complaint is that I waited in line for 45 minutes to check in, I was there for a conference and this was one of the official hotels (so they knew they had all these people coming).  There were probably 10 stations at the check in desk and only two people were checking people in. Look, this place is just about average in terms of appearance and cleanliness.  The nearby area offers dozens of hotels that are cheaper, nicer and won't nickel and dime you for everything.
