I had a 6:00 am flight so I wanted to be sure that I made it on time with no stress (I hate being late for flights!).   I booked a 4:30 downtown pickup and the driver was supposed to send me a text around 10 minutes ahead with the contact info.   Instead of this happening I had to call at 4:30 to find out what the heck was going on as no one had arrived. The lady that answered the phone said the driver would be there in a few minutes and hoped I didn't miss my flight.  Once it got to 4:40 I called back again and asked if I could just cancel the car as a cab was sitting in front of my building.  The guy basically refused and said that the driver would be there shortly (he did arrive shortly thereafter).  To note the car was very nice and clean.  I can see how if things were on time this could be a good experience. When I asked about a discount he said I should call back when I get to the airport  to see if I missed my flight first vs. just giving me an on the spot discount.  When the driver did finally arrive he said it was because he had been pulled over - which leads me to believe that he was running late in the first place. If I want to have the stress of a crazy ride to the airport I can take the Blue Line or a cab off the street.  The fact that I had to track down what was happening was not acceptable.  After I did reach my destination I called the company a 3rd time at which I was given a $28 discount on the $78 ride.  I do appreciate the monetary discount which moves this from 1 star to 2 stars.
