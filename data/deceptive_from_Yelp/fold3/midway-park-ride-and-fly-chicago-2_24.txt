What a wonderful experience. We weren't even out of the car when the shuttle appeared and the young man came to the door to get our bags.   The return trip- we just called- got our bags and the shuttle was waiting for us. What a wonderful experience. I would recommend it to anyone.  This was our first trip to Midway.
