Mark went far above and beyond to find me a Hotel and car in Boston during the busiest convention week i've have ever come across. I have never dealt with a more dedicated travel agent in my many years of travel. Mark was recommended to me by a friend who also travels extensively. He told me he had never worked with a more dedicated, professional agent. He was right! Janus travel not only lived up to my friends raves but far surpassed them. Mark I can not thank you enough for your work - you ROCK!!
