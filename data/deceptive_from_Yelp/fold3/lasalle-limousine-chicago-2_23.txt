This service is a joke!  MUST READ Planned a bachlorette night and needed a limo for 3 Hours.  1) They showed up about 15-20 minutes late... 2)  Didn't provide the ice and sodas we were told would come with the limo so the driver had to stop for that which wasted more time at a local Walgreens 3) On our way to our drop off location he stops off an exit 5 min before the 3 hour mark I guess I had... and says we cant take you until you pay an extra 150 plus gratuity . ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  we all said take us to our location and we will pay the difference.  He pulls over at a gas station and basically leaves 10 ladies, dressed up in the middle of North Ave and Ashland!   SERIOUSLY!!!
