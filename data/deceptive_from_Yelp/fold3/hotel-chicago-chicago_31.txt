Pros: 1. The staff is nice.  (Spoiler alert: the staff is nice at most hotels) Cons: 1. EVERYTHING ELSE.  Literally everything.  I write this as I am waiting for the "building engineer" to turn on the water to my room.  That's right, the WATER.  There is no running water in my freaking hotel room.  For the past two hours.  Currently 7:30AM.
