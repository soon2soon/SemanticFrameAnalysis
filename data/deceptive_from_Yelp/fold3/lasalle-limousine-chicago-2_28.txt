I would not recommend them at all. We ordered a limo to pick us up at the end of our wedding night at our reception in Lincoln Park & bring us to the hotel in the Loop. My husband didn't want us to take a cab, so we spent a bit more on a limo (which was about $65 for a 15 minute ride, and because we were getting a pick-up after midnight, we had to pay $10 extra). We ordered the limo to pick us up at midnight, but of course at the end of the night, we were busy saying our goodbyes and making sure our family was transporting all our stuff back home. The driver came in at 12:15, made a big announcement about how he "had to wait for 10 minutes outside" and that if we weren't coming out, he was going to leave. If I'm paying for a limo to take me & my husband-- on our wedding night!!-- on a 10 minute drive & paying you $65 to do so, you can wait all night for me. It was no way to talk to a customer, especially a bride & groom on their wedding night. It really was so awkward, especially that he had to make an inappropriate bark in front of all our family & friends. We then had to pay another $10 for "making him wait." Overall, a 15 minute drive which would have cost $15 in a cab cost nearly $80. I would never use them again & definitely not recommend.
