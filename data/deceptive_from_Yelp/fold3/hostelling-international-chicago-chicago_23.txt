I could not really decide between 3 or 4 stars - there are a lot of good things like the location which is very central and safe even at night time. Or the always helpful stuff which gives you advice or helps you out even without asking (in a good way). For sure the price is great too! But on the other hand they could do something for the breakfast bar, buy a new shower curtain (I felt a little bit disgusted about ours) and replace or repair the lock of our front door (which was a pain in the neck). I would stay there again - price, service and location are changing everything!
