Very disappointed from the start. Had troubles with my reservation several times because they misspelled my name, even thought it was repeated slowly many times. We are staying for two nights for our birthday and we got a package that they "forgot" About until we complained about it. Also reserved a one king size bed room and got two double full room. And the restaurant in he hotel "m/x" Â was the worst service I've ever had. We sat there for 15/20 minutes with no one ever coming to the table. Waitress stopped by saying be right with you, and she never came back. She was too busy laughing at a guys table. Finally just walked out. Overall just disappointed because we are celebrating our birthdays and are spending a lot of money for our stay.
