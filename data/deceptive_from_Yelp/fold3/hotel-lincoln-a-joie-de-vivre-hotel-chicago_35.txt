We stayed at the Hotel Lincoln for a girls weekend for my mom's birthday and she absolutely love the hotel. The staff was amazing Brett from the front desk was very patient with us taking pictures. The service was amazing from the front desk to the bellman. Our room was very clean and we love the decor. Very fun hotel. The location is great .We would highly recommend this hotel.
