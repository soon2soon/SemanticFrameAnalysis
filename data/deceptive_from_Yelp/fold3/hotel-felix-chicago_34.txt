So, i haven't actually stayed at the hotel yet. Take this review with a grain of salt. Essentially if you can afford to stay here then you can stay at the Double Tree for the same price and  get a bigger room without paying additional fees for multiple beds. I booked a room here through priceline indicating that the room was for two people. But they are only offering me a queen. The room is for me and my nephew both of us are over 6' 3''. I asked for 2 beds. That's an xtra 40 a night. I asked for a roll out bed. Sorry, rooms are too small for a rollout.  Really? The worst part about this is that I can't cancel or transfer.  My first inclination was to book the Double Tree. I tried this route to save money. Instead I'm getting a lower rated hotel, a smaller room and xtra bedding as a substitute for space and customer service. If you have similar requirements to me for a hotel you'll probably be happier at another hotel. That's my opinion.
