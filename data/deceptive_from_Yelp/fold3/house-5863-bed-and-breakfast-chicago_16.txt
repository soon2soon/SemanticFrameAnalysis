Not your typical B&B. Refreshingly urban chic, NO calico! I stayed for 4 wks due to business in town. Wonderfully quiet, safe neighborhood with permit-free street parking! Short walk to Thorndale L station. Lovely deck and back garden. Room and bathroom were clean and comfy. Loved the keyless touch pad entry, as I sometimes got in very late. Free Wi-fi, printer, and Rusty's help printing out  document at 6:30am were a godsend. I talked to several people who have returned many times and I recommended it to local friends.  I do agree that they should upgrade from Folger's coffee and store danish.
