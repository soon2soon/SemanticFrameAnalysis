My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday night. There was a wedding taking place that weekend, so the place was packed, albeit with love in the air. The decor is very nice, the hallways are spacious, and the bed was comfortable and clean. The Valet parking was $59 a night- which even in Chicago seemed ridiculous to me. Once you enter, you have to ride an elevator to the lobby on the second floor before boarding a separate elevator to the rooms. This isn't a big deal when checking in, but it gets annoying when you just want to get to your room. The bath linens were far from luxurious, both in size and texture. My husband actually thought I left him only hand towels to dry off with. There was no room service after 11pm, and for some reason the phone's shortcut to in-room dining didn't work, and I had to be transferred 3 times to finally be told there was no more room service. Breakfast in the lobby was not bad, but at around $25 a person, it was not worth it. I didn't see the price posted anywhere (however it may have been). It was essentially a buffet with waitresses pouring tiny glasses of juice for you. I found this more annoying than helpful because they weren't very attentive. The thermostat in the room goes down to 65, but we were informed by the front desk that it will only actually cool to 68, although ours wavered between 71 and 73 the entire stay. Also, the fan only runs on low. We called to have someone help us with our bags this morning, and instead of an actual bell man, they sent a security guard who kindly handed us our belongings to carry ourselves- aside from the rolling suitcase which he so kindly took himself. The hotel design is beautiful and everything was clean, but the service seemed to be lacking.
