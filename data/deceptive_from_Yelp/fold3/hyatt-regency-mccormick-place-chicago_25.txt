Hello Liz,  Good to know about the complimentary items.  Thank you for your response.   I didn't know you had free tooth brushes, combs, gel and tooth paste at the front desk nor did your staff at the gift shop make me aware of that, just an FYI.  I had to leave and go to the local gas station to get the items I didn't have with me.  Good to know.  HOWEVER, as far as the parking, I think you are missing my point.  You are using "downtown" hotels as justification to validate your pricing model however you are NOT a downtown location.  Matter-of-fact, the only advantage your hotel has is it's convenience to McCormick Place.  You are on the Southside of Chicago in a less than desirable area, requiring a rental car, because, if you walk immediately, North, South or West (no east due to lake Michigan) you would be walking into a HIGH crime situation.  So to rationalize your pricing with "Downtown" locations as vindication only proves my point.    If you want to truly compare rates & amenity costs based on comparable locations you would need to analyze hotels/motels from 22nd street south to 35th street from Lake Shore to Halsted.  I promise you, if you do so, you will completely understand why I say your pricing for hotel parking is WAY off base and that taking advantage / over leveraging amenities like parking are solely due to your vicinity to McCormick Place.  You have no competitors this local to McCormick Place which allows your hotel to exploit and profit from items such as these.  I am merely saying that your profit margin from this item has been taken way too far. I hope you decide to change those items because it will make for happier, return customers.  As I said, everything else was great.  The staff was wonderful.  Good luck. Jason Gobeyn
