Good Rooms, Great Location and Excellent Staff! First time booking here, I was looking for something a little different and wanted to be able to get around the city easily without a car. Right away the staff was very helpful and welcoming.  We were running late at check in so they brought our bags up to our room for us, called our restaurant to tell them we were on our way and flagged a cab for us.  I had read through other reviews that there corner rooms are the better so I asked for an upgrade at check in and they were very accommodating and honest.  They even told us that the larger room would be by the ice maker but if it gets to nosy how to turn it off. Later that night when we came back to our room we found a birthday card for my husband, 2 chocolate guitars, and 2 drink tickets form Matt Perry at the front desk.  It was very thoughtful and left a great first impression.
