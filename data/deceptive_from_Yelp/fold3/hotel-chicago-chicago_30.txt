Watch out. The hotel has a history of theft in guests' room. I forgot and left my wallet  in the room.  Within minutes they stole my wallet from my room and start using my credit cards etc ..   Although with investigation, they knew who took it, they did not do anything about it.  I have filed with the police and was informed that the hotel has a history for this problem.  The management is dishonest and they try to brush this problems under the carpet.  They deny and lie in hope that people are not ready to pay for lawyers to go through civil law suits. On top of this huge problem, the rooms are dark and not well kept.  My floor lamp was missing a bulb and there was only one set of towels in the room.  The only good thing about this hotel is its location but there are too many other hotels to consider.  It is really not worth what you pay for.
