DON'T BE CONFUSED!!!!!!!! The web page indicates: Outdoor Parking $7.25+ 1.00 tax Daily rate. Beware that this price does not include: a $2.00 fuel surcharge per parking stay, $1.00 tax per day, $2.00 transfer fee per day, and a $3.00 convenience fee per parking stay. The rate is really $14.25/day plus a one-time $2.00 fuel surcharge. At least that is what the fine print dictates.   One may reconsider remote parking and leave the car in airport long-term parking. According to the parkrideflyusa ad, long term parking at the airport is $14/day. (I don't know if there are additional hidden costs at the airport). Otherwise, the service and lot were wonderful!
