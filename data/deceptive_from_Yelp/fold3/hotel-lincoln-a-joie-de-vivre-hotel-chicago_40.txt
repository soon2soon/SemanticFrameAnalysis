Just checked out after a four night stay. We live nearby and have been refinishing our wood floors. The fumes were too much to bear, so my son and I fled to the Hotel Lincoln, while my husband stayed at home. What a great neighborhood treasure! We were in a junior suite, that was larger than I expected it to be. Very comfortable bed, a sofabed, small fridge, safe, nice sized walk-in closet, perfectly lovely bathroom, desk, large flat screen, WiFi, plenty of street parking, and they allow dogs. One of the things that was so much fun here was the people watching. They definitely get their fair share of hipsters. As a fashion photographer, I love to see how real people wear the latest trends, and many of the people staying at this hotel were nothing short of very cool. But what I really loved was how genuinely friendly and upbeat the staff was, particularly Edgar, who was so helpful, upbeat and engaging. The only two things that I noticed on the down side were that one, the water in the shower never got really hot, it was comfortable, just not steamy, and two, the valets never helped open a door, or helped with baggage. We were just pointed to the carts. Maybe because we chose to park on the street instead of spending $22/a night to park. Other than those two things, it was an all-around great experience.
