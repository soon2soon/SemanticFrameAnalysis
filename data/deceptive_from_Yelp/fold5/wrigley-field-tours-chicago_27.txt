I've wanted to go on a Wrigley Field tour for a few years, but I used to live in the suburbs and traveling into the city from the 'burbs is a nightmare. I checked the weather last night and saw that the weather would be perfect today.  I booked my ticket online, and printed it right at home (nice and convenient).  I was afraid that the tour would be too touristy for my taste, but it was actually really informative.  The guide, Rick, was entertaining, and answered all questions that anyone had.  We got to go to all of the areas of the park - the bleachers, press box, clubhouses, etc.  There was a bit of walking, but it was well worth it.  It's a fantastic deal for only $25 per ticket.
