My mom visited Chicago for Mother's Day so I was stuck with the task of planning an awesome weekend full of fun and mom-friendly activities. I know my mom likes gangsters so the Blood, Guns and Valentines tour was a natural fit! And, boy am I glad we did the tour. It was AWESOME! I learned a lot about this sketchy city I live in and the sketchy people that have lived here. Greg was the guide on the tour and it was very apparent that he really knows his stuff when it comes to Chicago's seedy underbelly. He was very entertaining. I'm a fan of pros and cons lists, so here you go: Pros - Getting to see Chicago while someone else drives! Getting to see the sites where gangster's brains got blown out! Learning about the crime, deception and deviousness of 1920s Chicago! The stop at the bar in the Congress Hotel! Cons - The stop at the cigar shop where Al Capone bought his cigars. If you don't like cigar smoke, go to the candy store next door instead. If it's a rainy and cold day, dress warmly. The bus makes stops and if you want to get your money's worth on the tour, you better get off the bus. If you are a Chicago native and want to hear some cool history or if you are a tourist and want to learn about some scandal, I highly recommend this tour! I plan on doing the Red Light tour or the serial killer tour the next time I have company. Thanks for the weirdness, Weird Chicago!
