What an incredible place, and a truly unique way to stay in comfort and style while visiting Chicago. Dramatically more special than staying in any hotel. Every inch of Villa D'Citta is decorated impeccably. The suites are enormous and classy, yet cozy. We recently spent 3 nights in the Venetian suite, which walks out to the lovely deck and hot tub. And the kitchen is out of this world! I know a previous reviewer said that it was sparsely stocked, but the owners must have gotten the message loud and clear. When we visited, just a few weeks after that review, the kitchen was full of eggs, turkey bacon, fresh salsa and pepper relishes, lunch meat, cheese, apples and bananas, juices, milk, lemonade, water, many types of breads and rolls, and even had hot dogs and pizza rolls in the freezer. There were at least 5 different kinds of cereal, a variety of oatmeals, and fresh pastries, muffins and brownies. Villa D'Citta is walking distance to the "L"; we used it every day and saved a fortune on cabs. Lincoln Park is such an exciting and friendly neighborhood, we almost felt as though we lived there after just a few days. The only reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 is that my fiance and I both experienced cold/lukewarm showers 2 days in a row. However, when I brought it to Ralph's attention after the 2nd time, he immediately apologized and said it was likely due to the guests staying in the suite down the hall filling up the very large jacuzzi in their bathroom around the same time as our showers. He offered us to upgrade to an INCREDIBLE suite free of charge, but since we were leaving early the next morning we opted just to stay in our room instead of moving everything. He is extremely accommodating, and genuinely wants to make sure your stay is top-notch. Even with that little glitch, I would absolutely recommend Villa D'Citta, and will definitely stay there again on my next visit to Chicago!
