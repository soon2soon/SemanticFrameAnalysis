Best hostel in Chicago (by far), for the price.  (qualification: I stayed in the winter, so I'm not familiar with their prices/policies for the warm seasons)   I was pleased.  Friendly, accommodating staff; great location; clean, secure premises; comfy beds; supreme breakfast (and pizza:); lively atmosphere... There's lots of stuff in that neighborhood (open mic and improv comedy [iO theatre], live music [Metro], ass ton of bars [Trace isn't bad], food [Salt and Pepper], coffee [emerald city], two public libraries within walking distance, and baseball, of course.   Being really close to the Addison (24 hour) red-line stop is pretty awesome.   It's a recommendable place, for sure.
