Me thinks not based on the awful bartender last night.  Didn't get her name, but she was behind the Rooftop bar on the south end of the building, long brown hair and glasses.  This woman should not be working in a service position with the public.  We ordered two drinks, paid for them, she was nasty the whole time.  Went back to order another drink, and she was so busy she forgot to add the Vodka.  I told her and she became so defensive, haughtily denied it- and argued with me.  I told her, "fine, charge me".  So she asked for $11 and poored the Vodka on the bar, missing my glass --and turned around to help someone else, and ignored me. Great place, good vibe, but one nasty employee and will never go back.
