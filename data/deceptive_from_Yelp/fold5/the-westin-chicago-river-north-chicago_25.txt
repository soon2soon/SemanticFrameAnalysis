The River North Westin was originally the venue for 2014's Chi-Fi Con, but the convention had to rescind the event. After rejecting an anti-harrassment policy put forth by the organizers of Chi-Fi Con, a senior event planner referred to the guests as "costumed freaks." Their social media team responded to angry Facebook comments using sterile canned legalese, then posted a statement accusing Chi-Fi Con of libel. If you are planning a convention or can't pass as a privileged Gold Coast resident, don't bother with the River North Westin.
