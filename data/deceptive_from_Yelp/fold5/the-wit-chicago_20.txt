We had our wedding at the Wit this fall and it was perfect for us and our wedding party. We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel and the view from the ballrooms is wonderful and all details were taken care of by Nell, she was wonderful. It was all worth the cost to have everything taken care of down to the last detail. The hotel was in a great central location and it feels like a boutique hotel even though it's 27 floors, the perfect combination of modern and comfortable/cozy (and of course the warm cookies at checkin don't hurt!) Â The rooftop bar is a scene after 9pm, but a great spot when the weather is nice during the day, and there are lots of great places to eat, shop & drink around the Wit! I can't wait to go back! (Wifi free in the lobby, State & Lake has a good atmosphere for a drink!)
