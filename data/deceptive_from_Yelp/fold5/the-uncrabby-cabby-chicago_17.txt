The "Uncrabby Cabby" is as good as it gets!  I have used them several times for trips to and from O'Hare.  They are always on time, give courtesy calls, have very friendly drivers that are willing to help in any way, and extremely clean vehicles.  Their rates are the best - flat rates, no hassle...very affordable!  Highly recommended...if you use anyone else, you are a fool!
