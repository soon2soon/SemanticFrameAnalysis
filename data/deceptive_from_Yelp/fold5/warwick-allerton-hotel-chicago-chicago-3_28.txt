I have stayed at a lot of hotels in Chicago downtown before and this one is by far the smallest and the worst within this star rating. Â The rooms in this hotel are TINY, when i first got there the room i was placed in the "View" was a BRICK WALL!!. The house keeping seems to not keep up with the cleaning either, i found a open pack of turkey in the mini bar leaking juice all over the cans and the floor, there were also stains all over the duvet cover! so if you want to pay for a overpriced closet sized room then go ahead and book the Allerton Hotel in Chicago!
