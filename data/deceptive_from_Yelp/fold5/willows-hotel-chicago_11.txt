My wife and I stayed at the Willows Hotel recently and found it to be very comfortable and reasonably priced -- even the mini-bar was affordable (I have never stayed at a hotel with such resonable prices at the mini-bar).  The staff was very friendly-- esp. a young man at check out (I believe his name was John) -- he was very personable!  We will definitely stay at the Willows on future trips to Chicago!
