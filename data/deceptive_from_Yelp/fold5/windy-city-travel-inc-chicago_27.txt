I worked with Kathy at Windy City Travel to plan a trip to Rome, Venice, and Florence for a surprise gift to my parents for their 60th birthdays! Kathy was great! She gave us many options for tours and hotels. She was also really open to helping us book activities that they normally don't book too (i.e. a tour through the Accidental Tourist). My parents had a great trip and even received some special room upgrades and a bottle of champagne upon arrival! I felt like I got a good price on the trip as well and didn't have to worry about feeling like I was overpaying for anything. This was a trip I dreamed of for my parents.....and Kathy helped us make it come true! I highly recommend working with Windy City Travel to plan your next excursion!
