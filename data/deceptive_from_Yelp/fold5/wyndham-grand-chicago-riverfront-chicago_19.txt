Even though the rooms were large with nice views we had a terrible experience here. The service is sub par. There  is not any real doorman or valet. There is a man wearing an outfit like one but usually standing inside not paying attention to the cars. The lobby is small so not much room for hanging out or gathering up family or groups. Also undersized is the reception desk where there is only room for two people though usually there is just one. Some of the rooms doors are chipped and need maintenance. Usually this kind of problem is due to poor leaders so the chain would be smart to reassess the current management team who  are so  lacking. They say they are taking a three star hotel and creating it into a five star. But this is not a hotel for a discriminating traveler, not for anyone with any poise or class. You can't just slap on fresh paint and call it a five star. A good hotel needs to have sincere respect and care for the customers. This is what happens when they don't.
