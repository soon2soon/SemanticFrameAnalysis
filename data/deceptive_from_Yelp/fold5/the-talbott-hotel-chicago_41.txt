I stayed here this past January with a friend who was in town and I absolutely adore this place. The moment you get out of the cab you're greeted by the friendliest staff who took our luggage from the cab and brought them inside while we waited to check in. Every person we talked to at the front desk was polite and super friendly. The atmosphere felt like home, which is why we chose to stay there. The staff does a great job at ensuring you have the best stay with them. I recommend The Talbot to anyone who visits this great city. Perfect location and a great staff. I can't wait to have a reason to go back!
