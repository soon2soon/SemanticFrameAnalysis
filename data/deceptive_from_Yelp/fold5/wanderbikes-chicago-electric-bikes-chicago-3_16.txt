On a scale of 1-5, I give wander bikes an 11.  I wandered into wander bikes one nice summer afternoon in Chicago to be pleasantly surprised.  I found a place that is great for the bicycle enthusiast and for the amateur.  This business, I found out, is a family owned, and operated by two of the nicest guys you could meet.  And then I rented a bike from them.  It was glorious.  The bike I rented was very easy to operate, and they explained everything I needed to know about it until I felt completely secure in operating an electric bicycle.  I could ride the bike, because it operates as a normal bike, effortlessly.  Then, I hit the throttle.  It was like riding a bike for the first time again.  Gliding through the gridlock, I quickly found out that an electric bicycle was the best way to get around the city.  It follows all bicycle rules and privileges (like the lake front path, etc.) yet I was able to maneuver the city like nothing I've ever experienced before.  I also rented a pedal assist bike from them, and wow!  Let me just say this:  These guys know what their doing with the electric bikes, and what a fantastic customer experience I had!!!
