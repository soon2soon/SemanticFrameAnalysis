We took the Windy City Ghost Tour as part of a bachelorette party in May with Ken and Sunny.  They were extremely informative and full of enthusiasm.  I liked that we got off the bus, (it was a perfect night for it) and we were able to walk around. It added to the "spookiness".  We ended up in Lincoln Park discussing the Great Chicago Fire and it happened to be on the same street/building where my daughter lives.  This was well worth the time and money!  I am now trying to get my family signed up for the Serial Killer Tour over the summer!
