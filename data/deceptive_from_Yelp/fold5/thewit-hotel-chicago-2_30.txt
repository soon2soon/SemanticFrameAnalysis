We just had our wedding ceremony and reception there! Sooooo disipointed! That place it's not worth your money.The hotel is nice but everything else is just terrible, just want to warn the couples like us don't do your wedding at the Wit you will be very disipointed!!!!!The price they asked should be for a high class hotel, they don't deserve that.
