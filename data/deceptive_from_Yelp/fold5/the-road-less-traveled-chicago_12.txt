RLT: Mission Wolf Â was a fantastic find! My daughter wanted to do something with animals but out of the ordinary, and this experience went way beyond meeting our expectations. They combined camping, community service, white water rafting, zip lining and hiking with hard work, community building, experiencing up close and learning about wolves; all led by young abled leaders. My daughter came back more confident and independent.
