At first I did not want to contribute to the self-absorbed Trump by attending any of his facilities, however, my boyfriend bought me a massage and facial there and so I had no choice but to go experience what I imagined to me uber-luxurious... It was definitely a treat, and the grandiose entrance and locker rooms made a great impression. The robes were very plush and the host was very attentive to my needs. Another nice perk was that you can workout at the gorgeous gym overlooking the river..not a bad motivator. However, my only slight disappointment, (which maybe I subconsciously looked for since it's Trump) was that even though my massage was heavenly, the girl did not give me my full 60 min and did not escort me back to the locker room and I got a bit lost which to me is strange considering that in most spas, the technician always appears after I come out of the room with water or tea...I don't know, maybe she was lost too:) Anyway, overall experience was wonderful and would highly recommend it if looking for a foofy expensive spa.
