The Ivy Hotel Sky Terrace is one of the worst rooftop bars I've ever experienced and I've been to almost all of them in Chicago.  I went for 1/2 off appetizers and they were still overpriced and completely gross,  The bar wasn't set up and there were cushions on only 1/2 the patio furniture,.. the staff was still setting everything up even though they claimed to be open.  Our table had rust spots and wasn't clean.  The drinks were overpriced....$7 for a Miller Lite and $14 for a generic martini.  The waitress we had was rude and knew nothing about the menu/drink and wine list. There were only a few customers on the roof but the service was ridiculously slow.  The management here is a joke.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL!  I doubt this place will be in business much longer.
