What can I say?...this place has it all. It's in a fantastic location in walking distance to everything and close to 2 El stops. The workout facilities and swimming pool are great. The rooms are top notch with stunning views of the city. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Stay there, and you'll be almost as speechless as me from being blown away by all the great amenities and attention even to the smallest details. Enjoy the Trump, and enjoy Chicago!
