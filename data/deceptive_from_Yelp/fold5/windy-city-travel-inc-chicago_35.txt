I travel for business several times per month and have used Windy City Travel for over 5 years.  I always work with Gary who is consistently professional, quick and accurate.  He always gets me the best fares and I would never even think of going on-line to do my own travel arrangements. For one personal trip to Prague he not only arranged train and hotel but  recommended sites to see and booked a tour.
