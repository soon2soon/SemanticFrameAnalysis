We came into Chicago with a group of friends to celebrate my 40th birthday. We booked this tour in advance. This was by far the best part of our trip. We had Southside and Johnny Rocco. They were awesome. Johnny Rocco is such a good story teller that as he was giving some of the history, you could almost imagine that you were right there witnessing it. We also got to see a lot of the city that we would never normally drive or walk to, so wouldn't get to see. This tour is outstanding and I would highly recommend it! We had a blast!
