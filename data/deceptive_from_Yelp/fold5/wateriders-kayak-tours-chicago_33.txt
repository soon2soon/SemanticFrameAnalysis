Worst family experience we have ever had. Everything was fine until we met our tour guide Joel. Once he met us he proceeded to do nothing except hit on my 16 year old daughter. He wouldn't even help the other employees he just sat there making my daughter feel uncomfortable. The man seems to me like a middle aged predator, or at least, a pathetic-no-life-scum-bag. Â  To make matters worse he didn't even give a good tour, he recided a poem with atrocious delivery, he was dry, grim, boring, with no public speaking skill whatsoever he would just bark pointless stories and boring facts. Many of which where grossly exaggerated or just flat out wrong(which I say as a member of the Chicago Historical Society). The whole ride home I had to explain his historical inaccuracies and consult my daughter and tried to salvage her ruined day. So if you want to be lied to and sexually harassed the be all means, go to wateriders and have Joel be your tour guide.
