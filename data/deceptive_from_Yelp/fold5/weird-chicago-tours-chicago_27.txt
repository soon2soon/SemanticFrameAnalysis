our family of six took the haunted chicago tour today and we all thought it was great. clarence is full of personality and dave added droll funny wit. (I believe dave was feeling ill today though). I will recommend this tour to friends and am sure many will take advantage of it. We live less than two hours away and come to chicago a couple times a year and will do another tour
