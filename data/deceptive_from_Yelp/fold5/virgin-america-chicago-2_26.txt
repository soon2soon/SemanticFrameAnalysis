Virgin is the only way to fly. Superior service, touch screens to order drinks and food, comfortable seats, low prices, also they have an outlet in the seat to charge your electronics. This time I flew from NY to Chicago, they were on time & the flight was pleasant. The only problem is they don't fly everywhere. The only place they fly to in Europe is the UK. Go figure.
