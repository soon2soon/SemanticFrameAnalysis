I'm currently enrolled at Kendall College in the Hospitality Management Program. I'm working on a location analysis project for Marketing for Hospitality and Tourism. I randomly visited the hotel on Monday and was very impressed with every aspect of it. The lead concierge Kristen was unbelievably helpful and gave my partner and I a tour of the hotel. She was able to answer every question we threw at her and gave us the knowledge we needed to achieve success within our project. Beautiful hotel with an amazing theme filled with great employees!
