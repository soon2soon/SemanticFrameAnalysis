I went to dinner at the restaurant here with my now fiancé so I could propose in a proper setting. She was immediately breathless at the beauty that is the Peninsula, which was a wonderful sign and I felt that the evening would be nothing short of perfect! Once we ordered and had our wine in front of us, I watched the waiter leave and took my opportunity to pop the question. Of course, because it was evening time, there were other patrons in the restaurant, so it turned into a bit of a spectacle. However, she said yes with a shriek and a giggle and we decided to stay for the night after dinner. That night has been by far one of the best of my life, and I'm hoping it was for my fiancé as well. We felt pampered after staying there, and that's exactly what a hotel should do!
