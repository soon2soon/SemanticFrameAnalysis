My daughter is a college sophomore.  During her high school years she participated in 2 RLT trips and they were truly life changing experiences for her.  She was able to stretch, grow, learn and explore in a safe and supportive environment.  The trips helped her discover her inner strength and confidence.  They have powerfully shaped who she is today.  After all, if you are able to summit Mt. Rainier, new challenges will seem less daunting and petty drama will seem less important. I was blown away by the organization and safety of the RLT experience.  My daughter considers her RLT summers to be among her richest times and still maintains wonderful connections with her fellow campers.  She developed a passion and respect for the environment that would otherwise be hard for a city kid to discover. I wish RLT had been around when I was growing up!
