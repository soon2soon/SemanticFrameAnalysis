Stayed for 2 nights about $185 per night room and tax included for a friend's wedding in downtown Chicago. Loved their high quality amenities, especially the courtesy car service. Clean rooms, staff didn't wow us but met all expectations. Not much to see in the nearby area except for nice restaurants and MOCHA museum. May stay again if the price is below $200 per night.
