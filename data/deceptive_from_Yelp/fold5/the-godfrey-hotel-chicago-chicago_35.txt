Wonderful time besides our horrible spa visit. My wife and I had a great stay at the hotel and our trip was intended for a much needed relaxation and stress free weekend. My wife really enjoys spa services so I thought I would surprise her with a couples massage on the 4th floor at Spa Boutique. Not only were our massages a bad experience, but the girl with red hair at the desk was so unpleasant. She didn't seem to care about anything but her cell phone. And the massage beds for our couples massage were crammed in a tiny room and I felt like my 5 year old child could give a better massage. $300 in the drain. Needless to say our weekend getaway could have done without that spa visit.
