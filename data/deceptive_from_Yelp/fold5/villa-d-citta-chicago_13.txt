Villa D'Druse is AMAZING! I stayed at the beautiful property in August of 09 and had a great experience. My sister found the hotel on a B&B website and we took a chance. We visited Chicago for her bachelorette party for the weekend and the villa was the perfect place to for it. Its very close to all the restaurants, shopping and nightlife and its right on the main drag so you can walk to everything or take a cheap cab ride. The boutique mansion, as they call it is beautiful! You feel like you are living in your own house with comfortable beds. You almost feel like your staying at your own house, just fancier. There are, I think 5 rooms total which is nice because I maybe saw the other guests there once or twice. There is a beautiful kitchen with everything you could possibly need, an outside area with a hot tub and spacious rooms. Nic was amazing. Anything we needed he got us, he's full of energy and a great asset to the villa. We have told all of our friends about it and encourage anyone to stay there!!
