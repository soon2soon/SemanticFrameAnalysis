We took the tour Labor Day weekend and we really enjoyed hearing some of the history of the "the city".  Being from the far north suburbs all my life, I knew there was a huge gangland history in Chicago.  But it was interesting to hear a little more that the gore.  Like what businesses the gangsters were in for cover and to drive around the southern side of the city and check out some of the old architecture. The guides were lots of fun and the best part was seeing them enjoying themselves so much. My 17 year old daughter and I go downtown every Labor day weekend nor for three years, and we were pleasantly surprised with this tour.  It was fund and interesting.  A little pricey but I don't regret paying the fee.
