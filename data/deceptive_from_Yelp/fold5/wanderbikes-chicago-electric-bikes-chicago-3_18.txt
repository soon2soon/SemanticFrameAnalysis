We had a group of 12 go on the Wrigley Field and Lake Front tour from ages mid thirties to the sixties, some had not been on a bike for years. It only takes a few spins to practice and then off we went. They did a fabulous job telling the history of Chicago and leading us around on a great way to see Chicago. All 12 would do it again. The price was reasonable and worth every cent!
