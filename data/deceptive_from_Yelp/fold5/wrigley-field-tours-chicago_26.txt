I'm an Indians fan and other than sharing some "thanks for being historically worse than us" sympathy, I know little and care little about the Cubs. However, I am a baseball fan and a fan of baseball history, and this tour was the most amazing thing I've done in the past year!! The guide was a young guy but he was great! He knew his stuff, spoke loudly and clearly and his speeches were info-packed. I got to go on a non-game day so we saw the clubhouses and went in the press box and bleachers. It was just so amazing, so historical. I couldn't get the smile off my face! They gave us plenty of opportunity for great photos. Nothing was rushed - a guide stayed at the back of the group to make sure no one got lost or left behind if you stopped to take some shots. I recommend this tour for any fan of the game, or even any fan of history. My friend who accompanied me is an extremely casual fan but she had a great time too.
