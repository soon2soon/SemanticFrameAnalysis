My fiancee' and i celebrated our 4th year anniversary yesterday.  We decided on the theWit Hotel.  When we first got there, the roof on the 27th floor was booked for a private party.  Although I was disappointed they told us it would be free at 9:00 p.m. It wasnt ready until 9:40 p.m. We ate downstairs.  Our waiter was not welcoming, he was upset because we didn't know that the steak appetizer was a raw dish (Hell it didn't say it  on the menu) the wings were fantastic, the portion was labeled for two but the serving was small.   After the pricey meal and walking around the city enjoying the evening air.  We came back and enjoyed the beautiful view.   WTH:  The drinks were like $15 and up. Although a trendy location. I probably won't visit or refer it. I will seek another roof top view any suggestions. Kenya
