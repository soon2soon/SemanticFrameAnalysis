Stayed here on Friday, July 5th, at the height of the tourist season. This was the first time at this hotel, got a great deal on Priceline. The hotel lobby was clean and nice looking, our double room was clean with a large bathroom and a view of the river. Great location convenient to State Street and public transportation. On the down side there is no pool and the hotel was severely understaffed. We called for an extra set of bath towels and after a 90 minute wait cancelled the request, got tired of waiting. The day we left the bellman told us he was behind 10+ checkout requests because he was the only one working that day...a Saturday in July!! There were extra charges for Wi-Fi and for use of the computers in the business office. Overall I was not impressed with this hotel and would only stay here again if Priceline offered an incredible deal.
