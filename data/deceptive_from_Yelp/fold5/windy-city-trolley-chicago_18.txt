We loved Windy City Trolley. We used them to take my family and soon to be husband to the church on our wedding day. It was in the height of rush hour on a Friday and they showed up way ahead of time and got them there safe, sound and happy! They loved it.  We had a lot of stress with our wedding and dealing with Colleen and Nicole was a pleasure. I would highly recommend them to anyone.  As a side note I thought the trolley was very clean (as I rode back in it) and not rickety at all.......We cant wait to hire them for an anniversary party!!
