We booked our room on priceline for our first anniversary a king size bed. We get there and check in and they put us into a room the size of a closet with a full size bed. When i called the front desk they said because we booked on priceline there was nothing they could do. So call priceline they call hotel magically we get our room a half hour later. This was a really crappy way to start our anniversary and i would never recommend this place the rooms are blah anyway even when it is the right room.
