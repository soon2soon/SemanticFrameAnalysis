When i booked a room for my husband's father's day gift on expedia at $500, i inadvertently booked for 6/16 instead of 6/19.  So of course, when we arrived at the hotel at 6pm Wednesday night,  there was no reservation, but i unfortunately paid for the room 3 days ago in full. 100% my fault, i know! So, we went up to the spa to fulfill our $500 in spa treatments we reserved and then went back home.  The manager offered us nothing, expect a room at the regular rate -- even though it was 6pm on a Wednesday night and they were likely not going to sell many more rooms that evening. The understanding is with 5 star hotels you are given exceptional service and an attitude that that is not only caring, but willing to go the extra mile.  We got none of that -- not a drink, an offer to try to accommodate us in any way, an offer to call expedia for us and use their phone, a table at their restaurant, or even a call up to the spa to let them know we were running late do to the snafu -- but we did get the party line that their hands are tied when it comes to 3rd party services.  I guess the fact that we are repeat guests didn't matter either.  Yes, it was my mistake and the Waldorf did a stellar job at making me understand that -- so I guess they did one thing right.  Nothing like spending $500 and getting absolutely nothing for it.
