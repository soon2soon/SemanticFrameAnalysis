The price for a one night stay in a room for two was comparable to the price of a room at a motel in a suburb. The location is great--squeezed in the middle of a few hip young neighborhoods (nothing is more welcoming after a midnight ride on the L train than seeing a young crowd get off at your platform). Very close to a train station, and surrounded by cool restaurants and shops. Â The staff were stunningly nice, accommodating, and helpful. So much so that it almost feels like an act... it is not. The rooms are very "no thrills" but are clean and welcoming. The bathrooms are clean, but make sure to bring your own shower supplies. Overall a great stay, and one I would recommend to any young travelers looking for a cheap but safe place to stay in the city.
