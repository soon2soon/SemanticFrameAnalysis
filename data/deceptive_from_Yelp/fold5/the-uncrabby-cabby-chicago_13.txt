I needed quality, reliable, trustworthy, safe transportation from O'hare airport in Chicago to Itasca, IL. A business associate suggested I call on the Uncrabby Cabby. I emailed them the day evening before my flight and to my surprise Phil, the founder/owner of the company emailed me back almost immediately. I sent a follow up email with my flight info and Phil gave me his mobile # and said he'd have a car waiting for me when I touched down and that I should just call when I get in. I called the Uncrabby Cabby right after I got my bags and Phil showed up in a beautiful and comfortable late model vehicle (no crabs on it) and got me to my destination in short order. I didn't expect that kind of service from a local company in a place as big as Chicago, Illinois, IMPRESSIVE! I run a service company and it does my heart good to see a local business owner giving great service with a smile at a fair price. Great choice!
