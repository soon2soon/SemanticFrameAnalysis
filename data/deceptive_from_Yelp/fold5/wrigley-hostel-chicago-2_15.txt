This place is terrible for the money. Whatever happened to Hostel prices? I paid $46 for one night. I could've stayed at motel and have alot more privacy. They do not enforce any quiet times, the toilets were not working and one was full of vomit. I asked for a receipt because I wanted to see an itemized list of the charges but was told I could have a hand written one. A pair of underwear were laying in the hallway, there were drunks coming and goin all hours of the night. The advertised free computers were down. Basically, this is an overpriced, dirty flop house, not a hostel. The very clean International Hostel in downtown Chicago is $10 less and way cleaner and there aren't disrespectful drunks waking one up all night. Skip this place.
