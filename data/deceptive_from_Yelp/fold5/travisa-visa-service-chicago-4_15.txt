I have no idea where these other reviewers went, but I have nothing nice to report about this firm. Wait. Yes I do. Incompetency. Late on delivery. Have yet to receive my fee back. The General Manager is as bad as his employees. All in all, I would recommend another company. Travisa Outsourcing delivers nothing but heart aches, pain and never delivers on promises. Extra costs were a result of their poor planning. The company says they strive for excellence, but these are only words for those in this company who know very little of what customer service means. They are rip off artists and should never be in this business.
