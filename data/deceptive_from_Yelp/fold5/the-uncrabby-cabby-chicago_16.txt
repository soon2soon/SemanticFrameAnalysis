WOW! Great company, service and friendly!. I have been traveling for business for over 25 years and have had some crazy cab rides to and from both Midway and Ohare. With out a doubt, this was my best experience to date. Phil makes you feel like you matter when you make a reservation, the private cars are clean and tasteful (no need to worry..they're not 3rd world bead delivery shuttles) and the drivers are on time,down to earth and personable (ask for Tim). The bottom line: It's about time the Chicago area had a private car service that provided real value for its customers and most importantly cared about you. Â That's Uncrabby Cabby, keep up the great job!
