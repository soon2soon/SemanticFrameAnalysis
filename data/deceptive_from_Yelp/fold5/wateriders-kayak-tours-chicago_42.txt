I run a large Kayak Group for the Chicago Area.  I reserved a venue for 30 people to rent kayaks.  I had booked this almost 2 months in advance.  I attempted several times to contact the, via email and then by phone.  I never heard back from the emails, and when I called their business phone, I received a disconnected Cigular Wireless message.  I had alerted this to one of the operators when I had booked this for our group 1 month ago, and was told that the website was being fixed.  When I was only a few days of our trip, I recieved an email back, only in response to my message saying I was rebooking it with their competion, Kayak Chicago.  I called Chicago Kayak, was IMMEDIATELY called back by the owner himself, and he was able to accomodate our group.  I did receive a mesage later from Waterider's, but I could not jeopordize 30+ who have made and palnned this for months to a business who advertises on their website a continuous discconected cell phone. What is worse, beside the fact that their store faces the water, and their address is almost impossible to find, is that this is a business located in one of Chicago's prime locations for kayaks, and the lack of attention will hurt the paddling community and those who just love to get out in the water.   THANKS AGAIN DAVE OLSON from KAYAK CHICAGO!
