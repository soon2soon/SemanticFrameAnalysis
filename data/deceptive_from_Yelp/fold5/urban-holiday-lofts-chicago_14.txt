Highly recommend this hostel! It's in a good location with easy access to restaurants and shops nearby. I had a great experience unlike other hostels that I've stayed. What makes this hostel unique? It is clean, neat, and appears to be well maintained. The bathroom is modern and clean. It seems like the hostels that I've stayed at across the country are older buildings that haven't been maintained well. This one has. Most of the rooms are on separate floors from the main TV room/lounge area so you don't have to tolerate loud noise coming into your sleeping area. The view of Chicago from the main TV room/lounge area is great. The lounge is also spacious so no matter how crowded it may become, one can find a bit of respite or a place to sit. The staff is friendly, pleasant, and accommodating. I also feel they don't nickel and dime you like they do at other hostels. I was actually most impressed by the fact that the housekeepers will actually change your bed sheets, if asked. I stayed in a room that had six beds and didn't feel that I was cramped at all. Loved this hostel experience. Thank you Urban Holiday Lofts!
