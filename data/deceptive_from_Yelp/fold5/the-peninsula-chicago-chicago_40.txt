went to chicago recently for a big meeting, and I could not believe how luxurious and wonderful this place is. I have stayed in many, many nice hotels because I have to travel a lot.  what I have noticed time and time again is that most pricey hotels are very fancy, but the rooms are often small and the service can be variable.  not at the peninsula.  I literally felt like I had 100 employees at my service, any time day or night, and here's the best part -- they did not make me feel like I was any sort of burden. I hardly ever had to ask for anything because they seemed to read my mind and meet my needs before I had to say anything.  my room was nothing short of splendid. my bathroom was like a spa.  there were extra towels, extra everything. you can see all the features of the hotel on the website, so i won't go into that.  suffice it to say they deliver what they promise in every way.  it was spotless. the common areas are lovely and large and relaxing. they have designed it nicely, down to the lighting and the positioning of everything. it feels like a movie set, only it is real and you are there. the food is good.  it is expensive and I was lucky that I wasn't footing the bill because it was a work trip.  but, I would even consider staying here on my own dime because it truly is a completely saturating experience.
