I love this station it's my favorite out of all amtrak stations and  the people are helpful  the station is always clean just the bad part is they charge too much just to put your luggage in a locker so you can go explore the city other than that it's awesome and i love the whole foods down the street from there . it has great food and it also has great archetecture did i spell that right anyway i love this station oh and i love chicago
