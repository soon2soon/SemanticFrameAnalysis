I recently went on another trip to France. I wasn't sure where I wanted to stay, other than Paris and somewhere in the south, and the fantastic agents at Windy City provided everything I could possibly need. It was a completely effortless vacation thanks to them. Â A much needed, relaxing visit to one of my favorite countries in the world. (Maybe it helped that Janet at WC is a certified France expert?) They knew everything about the biggest cities and the tiny towns in between. I got to experience the best of both and it was the most affordable trip I've taken in a while. (even in France's busiest summer months!)
