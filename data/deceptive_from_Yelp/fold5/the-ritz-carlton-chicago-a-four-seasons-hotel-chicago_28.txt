Gorgeous hotel with the lobby on the 12th floor. I was given a tour of the hotel and the guest rooms by Shannon Moore. I had been in communication with her for over a month while I was considering The Ritz for my wedding. Throughout the entire process she was very kind, helpful, and patient. I felt terrible letting her know that we decided to have our wedding outside of Illinois. The hotel event rooms are beautiful and the guest rooms have spectacular city views. Compared to many other modern hotels downtown (Trump Hotel and Hotel Palomar), The Ritz was a far better experience in the customer service category and it had a much more welcoming atmosphere. All of the employees I encountered were very kind, which is sometimes hard to find in those fast paced city hotels. If you're looking for a wedding venue in downtown Chicago, then I highly recommend contacting Shannon.
