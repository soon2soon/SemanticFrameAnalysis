Wow I love this place! The Drake is an amazing hotel. I stayed here about 2 weeks ago when I got some time off work. I really wanted to check the place out for myself, as I have been meaning to do for some time now. It lived up to my expectations, and then some. The staff are very professional and courtesy. They helped us with everything I needed without hesitation. The rooms are exquisite, as is the entire hotel inside & out. I have stayed at MANY hotels in the Chicagoland area, and I must say The Drake is truly one of Chicago's finest, without a doubt. I give this place 5 out of 5 stars, everything was perfect.
