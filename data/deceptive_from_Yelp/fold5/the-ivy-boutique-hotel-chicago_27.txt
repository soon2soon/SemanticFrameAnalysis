From the time you enter the glass doors to the moment you open the door to your room you will be wowed. The service at this hotel is topnotch. Upon checking in I was greeted by the Night Manager Albert. He was extremely friendly but authentic. He checked me in while I ran to move my car. I didn't feel like he was following a customer service script. He was genuine and I appreciated it. The rooms are beautifully decorated. I definitely plan on staying here again. Great service and beautiful rooms.
