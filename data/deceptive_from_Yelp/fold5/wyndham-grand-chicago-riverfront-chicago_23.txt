Upon entering the room noticed debris on the floor from previous guests. Looking under bed and found chapstick, used bar of soap and under garments. Our bathroom appeared clean until time to shower and saw what looked like blood on the brim of the bathtub. Informed desk by phone and was told room would be cleaned for us. When returned from outing the room hadn't been touched. Bought some bleach at 7/11 to clean bathroom. Used house shoes in room. Because this was our first time in Chicago and not knowing the area was not comfortable changing hotels. Will not return to this hotel. Do not recommend this hotel.
