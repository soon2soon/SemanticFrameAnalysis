This is a nice hotel that "should" get a better rating, but won't from me.  I travel a lot, and know the difference. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and polite, but there were too far many glitches for it to matter.  I arrived (a woman alone) with four bags, two very heavy - not met by a bellman until I struggled them out of the cab, through the single door, holding it myself and making it to the front desk.  Too late! Room was small, and below average as far as clean; a few hairs in the bathroom, only 1/4 one roll of paper and ran out of tissues immediately and the base of the toilet and the escutcheon around the sink drain need to be cleaned better (yuck!).  While there is a big flat screen in the room, it rarely worked well - remote would work, then it would not, or simply freezing altogether.  Woke up at 4:30 one morning, and put the TV on hoping to fall back asleep.  I had to have the engineer up twice at 4:30 to fix it.  Needless to say, I couldn't fall back asleep after that.  You have to call for ice - no machines.  And while this seems like superior service, after one request I waited 45 minutes for ice and had to leave before it ever came.  Elevators are incredibly sloooooooow!  There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel, and while there are plenty around the neighborhood, there were times I just didn't want to have to leave the building because it was very cold.  AND finally - LADIES... no dead bolts!  Unbelievable in this day and age. All and all, the Sofitel 1/2 block is a MUCH BETTER VALUE for the money.
