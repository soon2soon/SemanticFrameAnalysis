You definitely need to incorporate this tour on your trip to Chicago. It is a nice relaxing 1-1/2hr bus ride where you tour a large part of the city and see the highlights of the gangster era. The guys running the show are very funny and informal and it makes for such an enjoyable afternoon. Not only do you get to hear about Chicago's history but you also get to see so many sights and have a lot of laughs. Great for all ages!
