My husband and I worked with Janet to plan our dream honeymoon to Tahiti.  We contemplated Europe, however Janet had just returned from a Tahiti trip herself and gave it stellar reviews.  She took care of all the planning work and coordination at the hotels.  A trip like this took a lot of work- mini planes between islands, rides to / from the airport, etc.  She even got us a free breakfast at the resorts since we were honeymooners!  We had such a great experience working with her that we contacted her again to help us plan a Jamaican getaway.  We highly recommend working with Janet- she is experienced, honest, and easy to work with!  Thanks WCT!!!
