Overall I am very disappointed. This is my first time visiting Chicago. I live in Florida. I work in customer service and specialize in social media and online reviews. I was excited to stay at the James based on its excellent reviews. I booked my room at the beginning of February. The woman on the phone was helpful and said that my total would be $778 for 3 nights. When I checked in, I was told I had to pay over $1000! That there was an additional charge of $75 per night in case of damage or use of the mini bar. I gave the front desk my credit card, and then my debit card for the EXTRA charges. The next morning I get notification from my bank that my debit card was charged $932 and that my account was now over drafted! I immediately called the front desk and spoke to Milos. Milos credited my debit card, but told me it wouldn't show until Monday. That night I get a notice from my bank that my bank account has been blocked. My bank's customer service closed at 5pm and is closed on Sundays. Now I am left in an unfamiliar city with no access to my bank account! To top things off, I am allergic to whatever they wash their towels and sheets in and I broke out in hives. On a positive side, the rooms are clean and modern, the staff is friendly and it's in a nice location. I will visit Chicago again, but I will stay at a different hotel.
