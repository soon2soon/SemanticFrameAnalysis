Staff was great. No problems whatsoever. Aside from getting to your room after 10 and not knowing how to use the elevator. The staff showed us the trick. The bed was very comfy almost like my king at home. Great location, walking distance to the mile, pizzerias, Sears tower, Hancock center, soldier field and the navy pier...pretty much the tourist attractions. The club was nice. But I preferred the pubs and there are several around the area. Stout was my fav. Definitely recommended to all. When I go back, I'm staying there.
