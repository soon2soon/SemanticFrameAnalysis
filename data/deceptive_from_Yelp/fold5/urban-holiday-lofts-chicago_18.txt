I wanted to give this place 5 stars because it is what a hostel is supposed to be in my opinion. It is an inexpensive way to have a place to stay when I want to see the city a lot more than a luxurious hotel room. Urban Holiday Lofts is in a great location surrounded by many local shops, bars and restaurants. it's really close to the blue line for public transit. The employees that I interacted with were very nice and helpful. The room was small ( as I was expecting) but it had a nice exposed wood ceiling and three huge windows. I stayed in a room where I shared two bathrooms with the three other rooms on the floor and never found it to be an inconvenience. I had a great experience here and would go back again on my next trip to Chicago.
