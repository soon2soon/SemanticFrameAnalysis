I had the pleasure of going on this tour recently. I found the tour to be an excellent time and an even better bang for buck. Our tour guide, Seth, was fantastic. He struck the perfect balance between informative and fun. He went above and beyond to make sure that we had a safe and great tour, taking his time at each location (we stopped at several historical sites). We were first timers -- he consistently checked in with us, often providing us with our own private comedy show, with each safety check/smooth paddling tip. Overall, the tour was beautiful. Riding down the calm river, engulfed in the skyline with Â the lights reflecting on the water reminded me how much Chicago has to offer. I realized that I had started to take Chicago's beauty for granted. Thankfully, this tour and our tour guide, Seth, reminded me.
