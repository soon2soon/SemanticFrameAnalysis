Recently I had my birthday party and needed a limo on a short notice. VIP was there for me and gave me an amazing price and an awesome limo for a night out with friends. My driver mark was awesome and even had us laughing, he entertained us through out the ride. We were on time and everything was perfect to our liking even when it was booked last minute. I will definitely be using VIP limo again in the future. Also our reservation made by Anna was an amazing experience, she's fantastic at what she does.
