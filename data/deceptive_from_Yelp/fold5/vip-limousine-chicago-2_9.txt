Booked these guys for my wedding; Lady I spoke to on the phone was phenomenal. I thought I was so lucky to find such a great company with such good customer care... And then we got our actual limo service... First the driver arrived late, the package we paid for the interior of the limo is supposed to have matching decoration to your wedding theme... it looked like a strip joint inside the limo; which honestly was the least offensive part. The real kicker was when the limo driver interrupted my wedding 5 separate times to let us know what time our limo was booked until and how much time we had remaining, even though the first time we told him if we go over we are happy to cover any additional time. When we finally got into the vehicle after the ceremony and were being waved off by our family and friends the drivers comes inside and starts talking about payment and money...Wtf? Then the driver took us to the wrong hotel at the end of the night so we went over our time by about 30 minutes (the time it took to correct where we were going) and the extra hour the guy charged was more then what I was quoted over the phone. The entire experience was terrible and unprofessional and I will never recommend this company to anyone.
