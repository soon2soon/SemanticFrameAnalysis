I absolutely loved staying here. The staff made checking in easy, was incredibly helpful, and friendly. The room was a great size, but still cozy. Also, the walls were very well insulated against noise, so it was easy to fall asleep. If I would recommend the Talbott to anyone who is visiting Chicago!
