I had to take a few minutes to let everyone know that I used Top Fleet twice and have been beyond happy each time. The driver went out of his way to help me with my bags at the airport as well as carrying them up to my 4th floor condo! I don't travel very much but when I do I will be sure to use them for all my transportation needs. Highly recommended!
