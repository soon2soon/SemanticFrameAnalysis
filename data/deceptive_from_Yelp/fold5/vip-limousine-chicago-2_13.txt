Phenomenal service. We had a party of 10, 5 adults and 5 young children. It was a freezing Friday evening, we were headed to the UC for the Hawks game. I made the reservation through Anna, who was just lovely. Pleasant, upbeat, informative, a true professional. Not to mention patient, she definitely set the tone. Wojtek was our driver, he showed up 15 minutes early, but we definitely did not feel rushed. It has been a very long time since I have had a driver of his caliber. He was very kind, especially to the children. He was incredibly efficient, he avoided Friday night traffic. His driving skills were impeccable, very safe and smooth. He was knowledgable about the area, and had a great meet up point. Refreshments were cold, the limo was immaculate. We are thrilled with our experience, we will definitely be using VIP for all of our future events. They went above and beyond. I highly recommend them to anyone.
