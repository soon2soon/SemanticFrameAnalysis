Came and stayed here for Christmas 2012. It doesn't get any better than this! Comfortable, wonderful rooms rich with history. Mell, the Innkeeper, and his wife Angie truly made the 4 of us feel like it was our place. I've been to other B&B's and never felt quite comfortable enough to lounge around the main floor living room. Not here. Felt very comfortable. These are good people that will make you feel like family and go to the extra mile to make your stay more enjoyable. Mell offers rides to various local restaurants and music venues. Not necessarily the touristy areas but places that really give you truly a "local feel". Of course he will offer to take you to the more well-traveled areas (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, etc). Oh, and the food he prepares for breakfast is very well prepared and hearty for a day of sightseeing. Oh, and the the other couple staying there were vegetarians and Mell will prepare special meals if that's a need you have. Tip:All the rooms are exceptional but the Nat King Cole room is second to none. Believe me. tl;dr - Awesome place. Awesome people. Awesome food.
