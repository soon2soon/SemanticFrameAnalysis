This hotel may be in the shadow of Trump Tower, but it's service, people and amenities shine above it's neighbor.   The rooms are ridiculous, they have an old fashion bar-trunk in the room that immediately pokes your curiosity, followed by the very relaxing soaking tub and rain shower.  The surround sound in the bathroom allows you to listen to the t.v or music while getting ready for a night out. The club level at the hotel is like having your own butler service, noting sounds better to hear "how may i help you" from the service. We ordered room service and had a late breakfast and the food was far from average. Everyone, the bellhop, maid service, managers, servers, spa personal, bartenders, bar service, room service and the butler service are all friendly and reliable. If you have kids and really need to unplug and pamper yourself or wifey, then stay at the Langham...you will not regret it!
