The Road Less Traveled has provided me with an experience that has forever changed my life. It has given me a new appreciation for the environment and wildlife. I attended the Call of the Wild trip, which involves volunteering at a wolf sanctuary in Colorado. There, we met the wolves, fed them, built them shelters, and did other odd jobs. Through these activities, I felt that I was really making a difference. I never thought that I would be able to interact so closely with wolves, and can honestly say that they are the sweetest animals out there. I am so grateful to have had this experience, and owe this amazing opportunity to The Road Less Traveled! Seriously go on their trips they rock
