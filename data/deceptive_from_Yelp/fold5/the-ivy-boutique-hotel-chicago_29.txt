Came upon this gem through booking.com.  Ivy is a lovely hotel., have stayed several times.  It is a relatively new, contemporary hotel,  smaller  (only a few rooms per floor).  We have stayed in the king suite.  It is very comfortable, with living room area.  Very clean, beds are comfortable.  Bath is large, shower with rain shower and hand-held, very nice.  Free Keurig in room.  Evening service includes baked treat, and anything you might need-extra towels, ice etc. delivered to your door.  Once had a problem with cable TV,  staff arrived in minutes to fix.  Anything you could want is walking distance...shopping on Michigan Ave., restaurants galore.   We live in suburban Chicago, take the trip into the city a few times yearly for MD visit at Northwestern Hospital which is 2 block walk.  Had issue with room rate for one of our stays at booking.com, Albert in reservations happily helped us secure a room without a problem.  Most recently called hotel to book our next stay.  Amy in reservations helped us that time.  Will do all of our re-bookings by phone, staff is great.  Doorman also quite helpful, recognized us as return guests.  Will definitely recommend to friends, and stay again.  A very nice hotel...nothing like the big chain hotels with hundreds of rooms.  Look forward to our return visits!
