Great assistance.  Gary has helped me arrange three separate trips in the last six months, securing flight and hotel arrangements, domestic and to Europe.  The devil is in the details, and Gary was adept at getting airlines and hotels to provide special assistance for seniors and minors.   I do know how to get tickets off the internet and I will likely do this for myself in the future - but for some trips you need someone to navigate the labyrinths of the travel industry for you.  These guys are reasonably priced and good communicators.  I now have a reliable travel agent in my rolodex.  I recommend them highly and look forward to working with them again!
