A few buddies and I spent three nights while visiting the city from the Toronto area, I had never stayed at a hostel before but the price and location were worth giving it a try, and can say I am glad we did.  Good accommodations, friendly staff and community made for a very enjoyable stay.  No better place to stay in Wrigleyville, period.  See for yourself!
