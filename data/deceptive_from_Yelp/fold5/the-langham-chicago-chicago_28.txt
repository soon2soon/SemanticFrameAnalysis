Can't say enough. We were in town to visit our daughter at U Chicago and booked their Extra Night package. When they saw we had teens with us, they upgraded us to a suite, even though we told them the girls were staying on campus.Housekeeping even organized our computer cords and the doorman greeted us by name, so it felt like home. Felt like royalty as we had breakfast in bed one morning.
