I have tried a few different limo companies since moving to Chicago and finally found Top Fleet Inc and have been booking with them ever since! I travel frequently for work and they have always been on-time picking me up.  The vehicles are all brand new and drivers are polite and dressed well.  Iam always greeted with a bottled water and a clean car!  The price is very competitive, I have paid almost double with some of the other companies I have used! Great for corporate travel!!
