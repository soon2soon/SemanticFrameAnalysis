Avoid this like the plague- unless you enjoy bad service, the El running through your bedroom, and BUGS. I stayed at the inn for a night in September 2014. First off, after making my reservation I received a lengthy email requesting a two hour window for my check in- noting that I should respect the staff's time and that I would be charged $25 if I arrived outside my window. I specified that I would arrive between 3-5pm and received a confirmation email about this time. I arrived at the inn at 3pm. No one was there during my arrival, I phoned the number for the inn 6 times for over 45 mins and left multiple messages, however, I did not receive any response. Finally, at 3:50, a staff member leniently strolled down the street. She said she didn't know about my window and assumed I'd arrive at 5. She was extremely unprepared for my arrival. Although I was told there would be wifi, there was none. The network they told me to connect to did not exist. I called the manager- she said that they would reimburse me to use the cafe down the street. While I appreciated this, I wish they actually did have wifi available. I left my receipts at the inn, I have yet to hear how I would be reimbursed. Although these things were had, the cleanliness and location were the worst. Â  The inn was DISGUSTING. There were ants everywhere! Ew. Also, the El runs directly out the backdoor. The blue line that runs 24/7 sounded like it was in my room with me while I slept. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy. UGH.
