Went on this tour many years ago and decided to treat out of town friends in for the holiday weekend to something different in Chicago - this fit the bill!  GREAT tour!  2 hours is perfect - not too long or short.  Guides were a lot of fun and very entertaining.  They really rolled the fun in with the history!  It's something completely different and you learn something too while having a great time.  Looking for something different and off-beat?  Try the Untouchable Gangster Tours!
