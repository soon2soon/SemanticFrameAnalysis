DO NOT use Travisa for India Business Visa applications. Travisa is no longer the official outsourcing agency for the India Consulate. These are now being processed by CKGS. My application sent to Travisa was then sent to CKGS. This results in unnecessary delays. Additionally, CKGS is cheaper... go figure.
