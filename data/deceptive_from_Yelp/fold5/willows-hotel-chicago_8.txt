The livingsocial deal was not honored by the hotel because they ran out of rooms on the weekend before the deal ended. Further, the deal for $119 turns out to have been not as good of a deal as advertised by livingsocial.  It was not a 50% savings. The Hotel said the rooms run $69/night during the livingsocial coupon usage dates of Jan - March 2012.   The Hotel said they couldn't do anything for me because livingsocial doesn't give them any money until the coupon is presented to them. So it ends up being a livingsocial problem too.  I contacted livingsocial at the end of March 2012 to get a refund. They refused even tough the hotel couldn't honor the deal and that their was false advertising on their part. Deal is here livingsoci.al/WillowsH If you are having problems too, livingsocial can be contacted at 877-521-4191
