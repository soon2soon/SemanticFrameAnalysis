We stayed here with my partner for one weekend and Yes we had great time at this hotel. The customer service was phenomenal, very friendly and accommodating. The place was very clean and we had a very romantic weekend together. Can't wait to come back here. I highly recommend The Peninsula Chicago if you're planning for a romantic weekend with your love ones.
