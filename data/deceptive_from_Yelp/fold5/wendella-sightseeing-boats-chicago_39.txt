Absolutely fantastic! First off, tour guides "Bravo!" I have taken this tour a few different times with a few different guides, and each and every one was fantastic! They really know their stuff and are genuinely excited to give the tour. There are two main tours; the Architecture Cruise and Lake and River Cruise. If you are interested in sightseeing I suggest the lake and river tour. The tour gives you some architectural information, however is more geared at viewing the city. It goes along the main and south branch of the river, and will cruise the shore line out on the lake. The Architecture tour is filled with great information about the city. Being a Chicago native, and a complete nerd for history this is my favorite tour! This is one of my favorite things to do in the city. I love bringing out of town guests. Its a unique way to view the city and learn along the way Tips: 1) Buy Tickets on-line and print at home. Not only is it cheaper, but you get to skip the line at the ticket booth. 2) Arrive early! In the summertime the dock can be filled with hundreds of people getting off and on the boat. Get there early and ask questions if you need to. Boarding is 15 minutes before the tour, and it departs right on time. Grab a drink from the bar downstairs, get a good seat on the top deck, and soak in the stunning views of the city! adieu!
