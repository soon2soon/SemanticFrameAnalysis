Aweful!!! This is the second time we stayed here. Admittedly it was our mistake for booking it again. Both times we had horrible views. The rooms are small, noisy and very unsanitary. The shower looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. There was hair everywhere including the pillows. We both are blonde and the hair was dark brown or black. Bottle caps on the floor. This place is nasty! Do not stay here!
