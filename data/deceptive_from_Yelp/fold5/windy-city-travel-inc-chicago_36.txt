Gary Trick was recommended to me when I moved to Chicago years ago, and he has organized many a trip for me.  A few weeks ago he arranged our Christmas and New Years trip to California and Hawaii.  When I mentioned to Gary in passing that my girlfriend who hoped to join us for New Years Eve couldn't find a hotel room, he made a few calls and arranged that too!  What I like about Gary is that he thinks "outside the box"; he knows that our family likes a mix of relaxation and adventure, so he has come up with super ideas for us:  St. Lucia in April 2005, where we hiked and snorkelled as well as laid on the beach.  A great trip was Belize in 2007, where we spent 3 days in a riverside Eco Lodge learning about the local wildlife, the nearby ancient ruins, and took a few long canoe trips to explore the ancient canals.  We followed this with 4 days on an off-shore island where we dove and snorkeled.  Gary listens to what we say, makes many suggestions about destinations, keeps our budget in mind........just what a good travel agent should do.  We have never been anything but very satisfied with his work, and we love that he has suggested places to us that we would never have thought of on our own.
