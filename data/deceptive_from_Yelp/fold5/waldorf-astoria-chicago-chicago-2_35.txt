took my wife here and stayed in the gold coast suite. We had a great time. The service and staff were all super friendly and nice. They made sure we wanted for nothing! Being that it was our anniversary they helped us celebrate by comping us a bottle of champagne for our room and a couple free movies. Im so very satisfied with my stay at the Waldorf i definatly will go agian! keep up the good work.
