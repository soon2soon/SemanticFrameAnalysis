I been to three of the tours, Haunted Chicago with Clarence, and Serial Killers and Devil and the White City with Sunny, and I'm always sooooooo amazed with all I learn. They make me love history even more and more every day and make me so curious to dig down deeper in the whole. If you like violence, serial killers, creepy stuff and all from Chicago, you must go to the tours! The tour guides are funny, creative and never one dull or boring moment. Time flies when you go to the tours and you wish you learn more so it hooks you to want to go to another tour or take the tour again! It's truly beautiful even if it creep you out. The tour guides make you want to go research all this stuff and it's like man I want to digest it all in a minute! This tours make Chicago more and more interesting that I don't think I want to leave it to travel when I know all this awesome stuff!
