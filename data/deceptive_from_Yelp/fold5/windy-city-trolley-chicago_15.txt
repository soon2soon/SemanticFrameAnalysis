Windy City Trolley was incredible.  I hired them for my birthday party this last weekend and some of my guests had never visited Chicago.  I wanted to make it special for everyone and do something unique to the city.  Tom, our driver, was an incredibly kind gentleman, very professional and welcoming to everyone.  He even helped the woman off the trolley which is just dang cute.  He was like a grandpa you wanted to hug.  Windy City was incredibly flexible with my itinerary which changed a couple times.  They even provided foam coolers and trash bags (which I totally forgot).  Overall, thank you for making the night so special!  Would definitely recommend.
