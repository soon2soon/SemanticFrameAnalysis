My favorite airline. Wish they had more routes and times out of O'Hare. However, if given the chance, I will pay a little more if Virgin has a flight to where I am headed. The planes are clean and modern and the staff look happy to be there. Such a nice treat to see people who don't look angry to be working for an airline. The personal tv's with movies and live satellite tv make it a favorite of my children as well.
