Our son has participated in 2 of RLTs trips, Ridges and Rapids and Conservation is the Key and has had phenomenal experiences on both.  The trip leaders and Jim and Donna Stein offer challenging experiences that are led with remarkable care and attention to the well-being of each group member and the group as a whole.  They extend themselves before and after the trip to make sure that each participant can reach and exceed his expectations and are so thoughtful about enhancing the entire group experience.  We and our son cannot say enough good things about RLT and their staff.  He looks forward to planning next year's trip even before the equipment is stored away from the current travels.  RLT lives its philosophy of thoughtful participation in the world from the beginning of preparation through follow up and care about each participants well-being.
