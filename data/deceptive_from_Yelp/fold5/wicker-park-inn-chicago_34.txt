Only stayed one night so can't comment much on food or service. But I will definitely stay here again when I'm in IL.I loved the old, historic feeling of the hotel. It has a grand, magnificent feel, charm & character which not many hotels, esp chains can match. One of the best experiences I can remember from a downtown hotel.
