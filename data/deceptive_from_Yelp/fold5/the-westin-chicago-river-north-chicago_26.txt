Less than pleased with my stay here... We requested a two bed room, they "upgraded" us to a corner room with only one bed.  When we reminded them we needed two beds, they told us they didn't have any available.  We had dinner reservations and after a long car ride we needed to shower and change.  They apologized profusely and said they would provide us with extra amenities for our troubles.  When we went to keep our bags with a luggage attendant, we waited for over 15 minutes while the valet parker came in and demanded us for our keys.  We walked around the city (great location), returned to the hotel and our room still wasn't ready.  We were told we would be called when our room was ready.  We went up to check a while later, and were given free drink tickets for the hotel bar. After our drinks (after calling to push back our reservations an hour and a half...) we went up to check on the progress of our room AGAIN, they said it was ready and we should had been called over 30 minutes prior.  Such a nightmare and a nuisance.  Not to mention we never received the "extra amenities".  I even called, was treated very poorly, and received two bottled beers hours later, when we were already enjoying our night away from this unorganized hotel.   For the money, find a different hotel where you will be treated like a guest should.  If you have no plans and don't mind waiting around because the location is more important to you, then go ahead and book.
