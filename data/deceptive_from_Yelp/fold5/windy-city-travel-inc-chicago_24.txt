Kathy was delightfully professional, warm, patient and eager to arrange our trip and it turned out to be even better than we could have imagined. EVERYTHING when so smoothly down to the smallest detail (private tours, nice hotels, transports).  She was always quick to respond to inquiries, suggesting additions and changes as we developed an itinerary.  The trip was more incredible than we could have imagined.   We wanted to stay longer and next time we will. Thanks to Kathy at Windy City Travel agency for making this "once in a lifetime" trip so magical..
