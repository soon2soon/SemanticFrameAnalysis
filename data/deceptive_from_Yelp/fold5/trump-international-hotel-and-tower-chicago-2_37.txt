! The room service is first-class. It doesn't matter if you take the lowest priced package. The service is great with polite and friendly staff that are always at your beck and call. Oh... the rooms, fantastic. Modern amenities with wifi, something many other pricey hotels are still lacking in. I could go on and on though I must mention the wonderful view facing the river. What else could a guest ask for? Everything at the Trump was perfect and had an air of newness to it. There is the amazing floor to ceiling windows that made me feel like I was walking in the air. Add items like the $60 breakfast credit, $50 food credit and free parking. There is no other hotel that pays so much attention to detail in Chicago. I will definitely be a regular guest. Great place for Bears Fans...
