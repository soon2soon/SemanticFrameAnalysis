Overall I am happy with this hotel. The decor is exceptional, the rooms have great views and a full kitchen even in the lowest price room. The restaurant is also wonderful, the food tastes great compared to other hotels I've eaten at. I even purchased some trinkets from the gift shop. Obviously the luxuries come at a price, but if you are willing to dish out the extra cash it is worth it.
