did not stay here, but have been to the IO rooftop twice. one of the better rooftops in chicago in terms of the scene. but what made me wanna give it 5 stars is the friendly staff. places like this can come across pretentious, especially being the hot new spot in river north. but from the doormen to the hostess and bartenders (esp Joey, Jared, Piers, and Stavros), the service was exceptional and really make your night. in fact, one of the best old fashioned's i've had in the city. I ordered off the menu and Piers made a solid 1 ice cube Old Fashioned. actually even better the second time around. give it a shot!
