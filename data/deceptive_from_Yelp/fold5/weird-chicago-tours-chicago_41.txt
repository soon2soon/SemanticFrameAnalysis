This was my second Weird Chicago tour and my husband's first.  I think he was a bit skeptical at first but once Clarence (our tour guide) got to talking and telling the stories of all the disasters that have taken place in Chicago, the history, the dates, the people, my husband was hooked.  He's ready for another tour.  We plan to do the Serial Killer tour in March.  Clarence was a great guide.  Michael our driver was great getting us around the city.  Thanks to both of them for a wonderful evening.  See you in March!
