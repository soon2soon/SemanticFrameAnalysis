Gary at Windy City Travel on Wells has been planning trips for me since 2004! I traveled to Africa with an amazing experience that Gary planned the hotel, Airport pick up and tours! I then went to Italy on his booking, Rome, Florence and Venice. Â I like that we discussed these location what to do, and how long to stay, oh he book train travel too. 2008 on to Madrid Spain and Portugal again Gary was amazing. I never worry when he plans my trips even when I stay with in a budget. I'll be using Gary for my trip to Greece this coming Spring!! Gary thank you for being so Wonderful..
