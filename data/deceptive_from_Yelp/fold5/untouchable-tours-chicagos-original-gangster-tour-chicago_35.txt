As others have mentioned, this tour deals with a lot of places that are no longer there. The late mayor (Daley the Elder) was so concerned about the image of Chicago that he did everything he could do to tear down structures that related to the age of the gangsters. He did nothing to change the history of the town, nor did he abate the appetite of those that want to learn about it. Boss Daley didn't have a clue it seems. Ah well.. Having said that, the tour visits areas of the city that most tours dont, and the presentation, which runs about two hours is entertaining. Obanion's flower show and the St Valentines massacre site are parking lots, but the Biograph Theater and the ghosts of the past are still there
