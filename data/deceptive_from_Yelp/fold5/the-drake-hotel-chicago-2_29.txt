Went for high tea with a group of ladies.  Service was great and accommodated my gluten-free needs.  Space gets a bit tight if adding the champagne (with St. Germain for an even tastier option).  Recommend making a reservation, and not entering from Oak/Lake Shore as it's easier from Michigan (got lost).
