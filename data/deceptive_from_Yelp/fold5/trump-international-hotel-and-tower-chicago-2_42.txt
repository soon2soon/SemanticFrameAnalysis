Glamorous and stylish. We arrived for our honeymoon after coming from our wedding and something was wrong with our online reservation so we were given the upgrade to a king suite. Chocolate treats were brought to the room. The service was gracious. The room was huge and felt like condo living-a dressing area, huge tub and shower, a second bathroom, full kitchen, fireplace. The decor is very cool.
