Worst customer service I've received in my life! As we waiting a half hour for our car to be parked after check in in the cold, we watched ten people get there car parked as we were ignored. We finally said something we were treated horribly Â because someone said a swear word and one of the valet actually called my boyfriend a b*tch and told him he did know who he was and what he could do to him! When complain to management we were kicked out and insulted! Saul is the worst manager I've ever incountered. No customer service and no common decently. U should be ashamed of yourself. For such large hotel maybe you should watch the hoodlums you have on your staff. Threating paying customers is not how you keep and maintain a good business. I will be filing a very large complaint tomorrow! !!!
