One star for the ultra butch lesbian security personnel that harassed my wife. We walked into the hotel, I believe she did security for the roof top... And she places her hand down the swell of her back and asked if she was, "Happily," married. I would not recommend this unprofessional staff to anyone considering a stay from out of town. Or in-town for that matter. Horrendous unprofessionalism. I'd rather stay at J Parker, Palmer House, etc... Lots of better options.
