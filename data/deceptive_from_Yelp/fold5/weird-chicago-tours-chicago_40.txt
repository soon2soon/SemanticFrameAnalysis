We booked a Weird Chicago tour as part of our girls weekend in the city. We had already been on a few different tours and done most of the big "tourist stops" in Chicago (and seen the inside of the ER unfortunately) so we decided to do the "weird and haunted" tour to wrap up the trip. Out tour guide was Sunny, and she is fantastic! She was funny, outgoing and very well informed which motivated us to book a tour for our return to Chicago this upcoming March. I'd definitely recommend this for for fans of the "unusual" side of Chicago!
