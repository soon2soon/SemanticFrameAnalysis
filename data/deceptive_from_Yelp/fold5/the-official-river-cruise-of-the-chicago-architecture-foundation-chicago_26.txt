This tour is an absolute must for anyone visiting Chicago.  We did it at the start of our week long visit and it opened our eyes to things we would have missed/ignored while walking around the Loop/Magnificent Mile area for the rest of the week.  I ordered the tickets on-line to depart from Navy Pier.  However we saw the signs for the cruise leaving from Michigan/Wacker right outside our hotel and wrongly assumed that was our departure point.  The staff at the check-in desk were great and happily changed our tickets from the Navy Pier departure to this one.  The cruise is 75 minutes long and our guide (Victor) spoke almost non-stop.  He is very passionate about architecture and active in the municipal planning process so he was able to talk about proposed developments as well the existing buildings.  My 11 year daughter thought it was one of the best tours she had ever taken although it was a little less engaging for our 7 year old.  I highly recommend this tour!
