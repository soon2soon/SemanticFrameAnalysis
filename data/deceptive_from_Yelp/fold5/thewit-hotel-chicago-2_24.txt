Where to begin. I can hear every conversation of anyone coming off the elevator in my room. I waited for 5 minutes for someone at the spa to check me in. I finally had to ask the woman performing manicures (whose customer service and mani/pedi were the only Â great thing I found at this hotel). The spa is tiny with only one shower, so i had to wait to take one. There is shave cream but no razors available in the shower (I asked twice for one). They have a yoga studio but no yoga classes. They have bubble bath in the rooms but mine had no bath. The light switch was broken. The outdoor seating at ground floor restaurant is next to the garbage dump. I had 3 different wait staff during one meal. So I ventured up to the roof top bar (which doesn't open til 2) and the waitress promptly spilled a pitcher of water on my bag and didn't bother to ask if I needed anything. I had to go to bar to get a rag to wipe down my soaked leather bag. I'm so thoroughly unimpressed. If you're looking for quality service, stay at the Park Hyatt
