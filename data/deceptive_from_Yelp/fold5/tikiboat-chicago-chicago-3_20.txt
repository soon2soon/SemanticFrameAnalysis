Paul Newman died in December, and the Tiki Boat was destroyed in October, capsized in Lake Michigan.  I really hope no one thinks the Tiki Boat is still out there. Maybe its ghost.  If you were on it, count yourself very lucky to have experienced a once in a lifetime event.  Paul will be sorely missed.  RIP my friend.
