The customer service here is dreadful. First, they seemed really eager to get off the phone when I called, and when we got there, he expressed his disappointment at our Yelp deal. He then told us he wanted us to get life jackets on and get ready, and then left the building. We had to chase him down in order for him to tell us where they were, and that we were supposed to just grab whatever and head to the docks. We weren't given any help picking out a kayak, or told what do with it once we got back after our tour. It was pretty much a 'left to our own devices experience.' We weren't given any paddling instructions, which made it pretty tough because we kept running into things the whole way. If he said anything about the architecture or any sort of "tour-y" information, we didn't catch it. Also, the police came and told us to move along from our position watching the fireworks. Haven't they been doing this for long enough that they know where to park us? All in all, a really sucky company. It was sad watching the other streamlined groups go by and wishing I was with their company instead.
