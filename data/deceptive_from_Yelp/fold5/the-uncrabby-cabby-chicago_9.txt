This is just an "FYI message" of a transportation encounter I had.   When I asked in a previous message several weeks ago if anyone could recommend a service, Taxi 7 was given as a resource.  I contacted them, made a reservation, gave them my advance payment, and received a confirmation of our contract.  The following week someone contacted me to let me know that they misquoted the fee and I would have to be charged double.  They would not honor their contract with me.  I cancelled my reservation with them, told them I will never do business with them, and that I would let others know to be aware of the way they do their business (which is not the way I do mine). Instead, I took another look at the transportation services in the area and found, I know, it's an unusual name, UncrabbyCabby.  uncrabbycabby.com  They are AMAZING!  What service!  And, they are competitive.  I had the most wonderful driver and the communication with the company, namely Phil, was superb.  Both coming and going, they were punctual.  I could not have asked for more.   Brigitte
