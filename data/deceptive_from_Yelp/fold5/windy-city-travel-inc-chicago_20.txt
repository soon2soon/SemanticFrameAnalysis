My husband and I used Windy City Travel for our vacation to Paris and London.  We worked with Kathy and she was fantastic!  Our hotel reservations were managed perfectly, she set up transfers from the airports and train stations to our next destinations and all came off perfectly without any problems.  Kathy even helped secure us an amazing upgrade at a beautiful luxury hotel in Paris.  We couldn't have been more pleased. They were professional and responsive to our every needs.  I would recommend them highly and use them again for our next vacation.
