We used Windy City Trolley for a recent bachelor party and had a great time.  Everything was well managed on the front end and our driver couldn't of been a nicer guy.  He picked us up in Lincoln Park, drove around the city for a while and then out to the Arlington Park.  We were running a little late at Arlington and I called the driver who said there was no rush.  I was really happy with our experience.
