The Welcome Inn Manor is a fantastic bed and breakfast establishment! Not only is it conveniently located near Chicago's downtown, but it also has the incredible charm of a late 19th century historic home. Whenever I have visited, the innkeepers, Angie and Mell, have provided a very warm and inviting environment.
