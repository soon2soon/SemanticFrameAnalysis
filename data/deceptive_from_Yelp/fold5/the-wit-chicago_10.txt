This hotel is a joke. Absolute TRASH. We booked a room for a couple nights. The shower head was leaking, bathroom light switch was broken, bed runner was ripped, and their service was TERRIBLE. We requested a fridge about 8 times, because we were told not to move anything inside the minibar or we would be charged. We explained that there was a nursing mom in the group and she needed to store her expressed milk. They promised to send the fridge up but never did. We were forced to make room on the mini fridge that was already on our room- well we got charged for it. We had to call Â 4 times for them to take the charges off. They also charged us for the dirty ripped bed runner, that was already ripped when we got there. They also charged us for smoking in the room- none of us are smokers. We had I pay for Wifi, which didn't even work. They also charged us for having to vacuuming the room. WHAT!?? We specifically asked if there was a charge for cleaning the room, and they said there was not; still, we cleaned up our mess before checking out so that staff had minimal work to do. Their customer service is inferior. I will never.. ever.. ever.. stay there again. Absolute trash.
