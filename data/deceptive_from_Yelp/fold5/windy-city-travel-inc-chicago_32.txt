I have gone to Windy City Travel for my travel needs for years. Last year I took  a Christmas cruise that Gary planned and arranged for me that included every single detail. It was an absolutely wonderful cruise experience!  In today's world where everyone wants to do their own trip-planning on the internet, it is refreshing to have a professional, courteous and helpful team of travel agents to call on with all of one's travel needs!  Thank you Windy City Travel - keep up the great work.
