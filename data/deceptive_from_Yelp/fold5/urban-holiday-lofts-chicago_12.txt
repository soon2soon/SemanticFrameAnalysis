The customer service is a joke. Don't risk going there and having your exoerience ruined. There's a guy named Jason who is incredibly rude and condescending. He literally cussed me out and called the cops on me after I called him a prick for being one. There's another hostel right down the street called IHSP. Its all around MUCH nicer with much friendlier workers. I'm normally not the type to take the time to write a review on yelp but I have never encountered as big of an asshole as the guy Jason. I'm not the type to start fights either. Trust me on this one. Go to IHSP.
