My family (wife, myself, son and his girlfriend) booked a Weird Chicago tour during our stay in Chicago in May 2011, entitled "Blood, Guns and Valentine Crime Tour". We were met by Greg the guide and hopped onto their awesome bus with Happy, the driver greeted us and spoke to us before the tour began. Already, the guys were funny and this is how the rest of the tour continued. The tour discussed the gangland warfare of Chicago including Capone, McGurn, Nitti, Weiss & Dillinger among many others and there were many photos stuck to the bus to refer to as we drove along. Greg was very informative during the 3 hour tour (one stop for a drink / toilet) with Happy chipping in more often than not, with a quick one liner and a click of the lights or a rub of the fake foot! (you'll know what I mean if you've been on a tour). The guys made the tour interesting and funny as we drove to the many parts of Chicago where the dastardley deeds took place (although most have been pulled down now by Chicago authorities trying to forget the past. Don't let this put you off though, go ahead and book, you won't regret it, will learn a lot and have a real laugh too.
