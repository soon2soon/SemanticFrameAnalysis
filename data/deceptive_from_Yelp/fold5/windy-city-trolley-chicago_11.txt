I agree with Diane and Andrea, it was REALLY disappointing to have to give the driver directions on MY wedding day.  (And if it wasn't me it was my groom or a bridesmaid).  Overall, my experience was fairly good.  Good enough that I even recommended Windy City to a friend getting married telling her that she may want to type up directions for the driver beforehand. Her experience, however, is the reason I give Windy City only one star.  I was horrified and embarrassed at the service she received on her special day.  Not only did they send a trolley to her AUGUST wedding (90+ degrees) without air conditioning, the driver lied about it to four people who went outside to ask him why the windows were open.  On top of that, the sound system was broken.  I felt completely awful that my very good friend had such an awful experience. Keep in mind, I'm normally someone who gives 4 or 5 stars and writes up good reviews.  This was so poor, however, that I felt a poor rating necessary so this doesn't happen to anyone else.
