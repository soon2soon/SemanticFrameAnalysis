DO NOT BOOK A FLIGHT ON THIS AIRLINE. There is zero excuse for a flight cancellation because you don't have a "crew available". I have now missed my 3 day "vacation" with my grandson because of Virgin America incompetence. On top of that, I have lost a $600 hotel room as a no show (too late for cancellation). I HATE THE AIRLINE. DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE. Their restrictions prohibit them from flying a flight crew in because their operation is so small
