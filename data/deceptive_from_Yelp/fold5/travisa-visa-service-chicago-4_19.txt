as you can see from the post above. the positive reviews will come from travisa employees. every customer i talked to was entirely disatisfied with their unwillingness to help genuine people travel to india. americans who travel to india tend to be very good people, looking to be immersed in the spirituality and culture of india, but this agency, and the immigration laws make it way too difficult. ghandi would be ashamed.
