The room is way outdated. Stains on couches, chairs and carpet. Cheap furniture and fixtures. Hallway is dirty. For the price it is terrible. The only thing good is location. But, there are plenty of options for the price and the Red Roof Inn around the corner will give you the same for 1/3 of the price. Oh.. And no movies in the room. They will bring up a DVD player and a list of old movies if you request.
