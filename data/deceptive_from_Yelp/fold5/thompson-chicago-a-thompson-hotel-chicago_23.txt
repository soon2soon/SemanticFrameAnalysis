How can I give stars to a facility that is largely staffed by apathetic and rude employees?   My cousin's wedding was cut a half hour short during the dance set.  We had been having a blast, just dancing to some kicking tunes, and then suddenly,  in the middle of the song, the lights go on, like it's closing time.  But it wasn't closing time.  We had paid to have the party til 12:30, and the manager was trying to end it at midnight. Is the hotel not paying you enough, lady?  Do you feel as though your job is robbing you of your time, and that's why you think it's okay to rob guests of their time? It's not okay.
