The Virgin hotel is two weeks old and remains a work in progress. I had a busy schedule so I only made use of the room and none of the services and amenities. The mini bar is well stocked and reasonably priced at "street level" which is fantastic. There is complimentary voss water which is nice too. The room itself was exactly as advertised. Comfortable and modern. One interesting addition was a set of earbuds, which I should have used in retrospect. At 5am I was awoken by the rumble of the train nearby, which came pretty consistently every 10mins. I suggest management invest in double glazing, you don't pay $200-300 per night to be disturbed like that. The location is convenient but not exactly buzzing either, a drawback of staying in the Loop.
