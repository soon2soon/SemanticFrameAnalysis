I stayed two nights in a deluxe suite and I think I've found my new favorite hotel! A lot of credit is owed to the staff, who really seem to go out of their way to be helpful and were eager to accommodate special requests. They had that rare quality of being both very professional and very friendly. Â  The building itself was fantastic. I liked the just-off Michigan avenue location with a nice quiet driveway/courtyard. The room appeared to be very new and was as well decked-out as any upscale hotel room I've been to. The room service, spa, and bar were all excellent. The house car was a nice touch. The view from the room wasn't better than anything you'd find anywhere else in downtown Chicago, but it was fine. The price was on the expensive side, but well worth it. I can't recommend this place highly enough.
