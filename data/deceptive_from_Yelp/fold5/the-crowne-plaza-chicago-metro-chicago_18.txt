The bar didn't seem to be open the published hours while I was there but this was a very nice place to stay and conveniently located to where I wanted to be in Chicago. My bed was comfortable and my room was generously sized. The bathroom was nicely appointed but not large. The Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro is a nice.
