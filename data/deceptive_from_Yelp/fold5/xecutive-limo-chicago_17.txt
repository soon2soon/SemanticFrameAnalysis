Our driver was a bit late due to traffic, but Xavier adjusted our rate accordingly without thinking twice. Stand up guy. Once we did hop in, the limo and the driver were great. He even stopped back by the restaurant later that evening to drop off the cell phone my drunk girlfriend had left in the back!
