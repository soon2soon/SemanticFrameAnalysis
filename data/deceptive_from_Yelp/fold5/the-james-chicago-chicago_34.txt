From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome and everyone treated us wonderfully. It was raining later while we were out and after we checked out. We stopped in to ask a question and they gave us an umbrella although we were done with the hotel. I would stay here again. It is a great location to walk to many attractions. Pricing was descent, hospitality was excellent! This will be our go to hotel.
