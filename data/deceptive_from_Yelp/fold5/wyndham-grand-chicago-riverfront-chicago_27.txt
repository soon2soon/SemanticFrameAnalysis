We used The Wyndham Grand Chicago as our hotel for our wedding block in downtown Chicago. They were by far the cheapest of any legitimate hotel downtown for our wedding in September 2013 and I've stayed there before and knew the rooms were incredible. They have a sales person that is with you from start to finish which was very comforting; Lori helped us with so many questions. She was able to keep us informed of every detail. The Wyndham Grand Chicago had pricing for valet that was in line with other hotels' pricing from my research. Their location is perfect for any out of town guest wanting a view of the Chicago River and to be right in the middle of things; a close walk to Michigan Avenue, accessible to the CTA train system for airport routes, and in an area that is easy to find cabs. I was nervous at first to commit to filling 80% of the rooms in the agreed upon block but you just have to have a count of how many people would actually stay there before you sign the contract so you make sure you fill that amount; we met our block minimum with no problem. They had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for my husband and I when we arrived after our wedding which was so thoughtful. They had cribs available for my nieces and nephews, which was extremely helpful. Their lobby is beautiful and is great to have a few people wait around in. They delivered all of the guest packages to their rooms for a small fee but they all were there waiting for them when they got into their rooms. I would recommend The Wyndham Grand Chicago to any couple for their wedding block because of their inexpensive pricing comparably, incredible service, much appreciated reliability, great responsiveness, and beautiful lobby and rooms.
