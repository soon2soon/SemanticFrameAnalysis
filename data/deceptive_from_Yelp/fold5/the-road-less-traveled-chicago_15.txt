Our 15 year old daughter went on the eco/scuba trip this past summer, and she had an extraordinarily good time.  Somehow the instructors/counselors were able to maintain the right balance of structure and freedom that worked like a charm for her.  The activities were interesting and challenging.  The kids really came together in a touching way (apparent from how much they still talk via Facebook...).  RLT communications are clear, direct and during the trip a lot of fun to get - they use social in a smart way so that parents can get a feel for what's going on without being intrusive.  Our daughter now has her sights set on Africa for next summer.
