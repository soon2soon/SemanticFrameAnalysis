My daughter went on her first RLT this summer (2013) to Tanzania--we can not speak more highly of this organization and the incredible experience.  The leaders were wonderful and took great care of the kids, and we were able to feel connected through periodic photos on fb and Twitter.  We really believe our daughter had a life-changing trip--her horizons were truly expanded and she has a much better sense of the world beyond the US.  I just wish I could do one!
