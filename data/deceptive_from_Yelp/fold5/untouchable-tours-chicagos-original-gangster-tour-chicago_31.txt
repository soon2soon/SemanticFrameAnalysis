There need to be more stars to click on to give an accurate review of this tour.  As a Concierge here in Chicago, I have been on many tours, but nothing at all like this.  It was INCREDIBLE!  I would absolutely recommend this as a must do to locals and tourists because you get to see so much of the city while simultaneously being entertained by talented, knowledgeable (and hilarious!) tour guides.  The gangster knowledge that was shared was fascinating, it was musical, it was interactive, the two tour guides switched it up so you couldn't get bored and you leave one of the most awesome tour buses in a great mood and full of new fun-facts.  This is not to be missed!
