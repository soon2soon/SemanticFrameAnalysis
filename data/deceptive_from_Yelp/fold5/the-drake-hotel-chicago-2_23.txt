I am catching up with my reviews... I was there last summer and my experience was very positive. I really like the old feel of the Drake Hotel. The valet parking guys were so nice. My girlfriend was very amazed how polite everybody was there. The checking process was very smooth, our luggage was brought to our room in 5 minutes. We had the King Bed with the lake view, which was absolutely that extra money. We did not try the restaurant, just had some drinks. Great location!!!
