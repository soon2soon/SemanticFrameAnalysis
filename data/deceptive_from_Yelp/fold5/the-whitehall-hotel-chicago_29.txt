Apparently there is a dearth of hotel rooms in Chicago that this nice, central hotel gets away with offering substandard rooms in urgent need for repair and updating at exorbitant prices. Also check in happens at a glacial pace, I counted 26 people waiting in line for check in with only two receptionist on duty.
