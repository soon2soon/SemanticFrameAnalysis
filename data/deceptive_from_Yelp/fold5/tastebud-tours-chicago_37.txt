The Tastebud Tour we went on was absolutely amazing. I'd never had any of the traditional Chicago-style foods, so this was a really exciting experience for me. My dad and I were visiting my sister in Chicago, and she immediately recommended several activities for us, this being one of the top 3. We decided to go on the Gold Coast Tour and had hours of delicious, amusing, exhausting, fun yumminess! Granted we were so stuffed, but that's okay for a day - we even got to take some of the leftovers with us, so that was really awesome. I highly recommend this to anyone in town for a visit, and even the locals loved it!
