I would like to give special accolades to Pedro (bellman) and Aspin (concierge / bellman).   Upon, my family's evening arrival to check in to celebrate our Family Reunion, Pedro, with a friendly welcome,  was right at the vehicle ready to unload our luggage onto the cart.  Instead of leaving our cart full of luggage unattended, he patiently waited until our front desk check-in was complete.       Once Pedro had helped us get settled in (we had 2 rooms next to each other), he proceeded to answer all my questions on the locations and qualites of the late night eateries, as well as other eateries for the daytime.  He then went one step further and suggested that I speak with Aspin, his colleague, who would be able to expand on the eateries, as well as music lounges, and other attractions, Chicago has to offer.       Indeed, Aspin "is the man!".  Very professional and knowledgeable, Aspin verbalized a list of places to check out, nearby, and even included recommendations for some within walking distance and some that required transportation.       Needless to say, a few members of the family took a midnite stroll, several blocks away, to feast on one of the recommended late nite eateries.       Throughout the entire weekend, Pedro and Aspin checked on my family and relatives to ensure our stay was above satisfaction. They weren't obligated.   Yet, they went above and beyond their respective positions / titles to do so.  Aspin went one step further and assisted with a room relocation of my aunt to better accommodate her disability.       Pedro and Aspin, I thank you for help making my family's stay at your hotel, a great experience, with your dedication to service, your professionalism, and for "keeping it real!" Peace and many blessings, Lewis from Cali.  The man who was in search of the best BBQ Chicago has to offer.
