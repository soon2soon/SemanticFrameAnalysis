I started using the Uncrabby Cabby when I was travelling for business.  I ended up liking them so much that I use them every time I travel and always recommend them to friends.  They are always early, very friendly, and the flat rate is awesome because they won't rip you off like other cabs in the city.  They also turn the air conditioning on, which is rare in Chicago cabs.  Overall MUST USE!
