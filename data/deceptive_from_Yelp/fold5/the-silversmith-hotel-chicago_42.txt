My stay at the Silversmith was absolute perfection.  The hotel staff worked like a well oiled machine, and took care of everything I needed quickly, efficiently and very politely.  The bed was a dream for my weary travel worn body and the pillows were like heaven.  I honestly have never slept in a more comfortable hotel bed.  The food I ordered from room service was ok, it satiated my appetite, but wasn't as delicious as the description on the menu made it sound.  The location is prime, with easy access to shopping, millennium park, the art institute and the train.  Stay here!!! It's amazing.
