Friend of mine set this up...I was skeptical and ended up having a blast. We went really far up the north branch of the river (to around Division) and it was a beautiful August night. Went swimming over by the beaches north of Navy Pier. The two skippers were hilarious (they were USCG) and great guys with stories of drunk people crashing boats. Looking them up again right now to book for a bachelor party!
