disappointing 3 nights in the room off the entry.  Noisy, no sound barrier between walls or ceiling.  We heard everyone come in and out, go up the very creaky steps and then heard every step they took in the room upstairs as well as the snoring and conversation.  It was clean and the hosts were very willing to help.  However, there is little attention to detail and the breakfast consisted of Costco type food.  There are such nice bakeries nearby I had hoped for more.  Not a place to return to, and not a good value for the price.
