Wow, excellent service from beginning to end!!! We used VAM for transport to/from O'Hare. It was the perfect kick off to the first-class vacation we planned for months. Our driver was courteous and prompt, right at 6:30 AM. The town car was well provisioned with water and snack's, just in case you had the munchies or needed to quench your thirst, and well maintained. Upon our return to Chicago, our flight was delayed, but VAM was one step ahead of us. I called VAM once we received our luggage and VAM was at passenger pick-up within minutes. Again, the town car was well provisioned and well maintained. We will definitely be using their services for all our future travel needs and will highly recommend their services to our friends and family. Thanks for the awesome service VAM!!!
