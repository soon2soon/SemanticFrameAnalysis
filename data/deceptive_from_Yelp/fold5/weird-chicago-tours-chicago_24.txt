we went on a tour over the fourth of july weekend (the weird & haunted tour) i was the person who booked the tour for myself my fiancee & his aunt & uncle i wanted ghosts & my honey wanted mob stories & we we're thrilled when we got both in the same tour my man's aunt & uncle later told us when i mentioned this tour to them while we were planning out trip they weren't all that interested in it but figured it was our vacation & that they had been to the city a ton of times so they just went with it but ended up being very pleased with my choice & actually want to go on the serial killer tour Clarence & Willie were our guide & driver & they were awesome they kept us informed & entertained i would book again anytime
