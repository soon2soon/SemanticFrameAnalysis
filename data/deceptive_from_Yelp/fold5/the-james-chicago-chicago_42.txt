A wonderful hotel with a great location, just a few blocks off of the Magnificent Mile. Our room was larger than most "boutique" hotels and was very well appointed. Great staff too. When we dropped off our car to be valet parked, we were greeted and asked "what brings you to the James for your stay?" I replied that my wife and I were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. Later, when we returned from a late dinner, we were delighted to find a bottle of champagne on ice, some delicious chocolates and a handwritten note from the staff congratulating us on our anniversary. Very nice personal touch.
