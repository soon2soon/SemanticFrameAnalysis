Stayed here for a bachelor party, would never stay here again. The room's air conditioner was broken and never cooled the room below 75F, despite repeated calls to the front desk. Multiple items in the room were broken and inoperable. The staff was unfriendly, including the Hotel Manager who was rude and unhelpful.
