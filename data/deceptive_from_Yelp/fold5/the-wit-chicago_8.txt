This is the first negative review I have ever written. My dear friends hosted their wedding at The Wit earlier this November, and management could not have botched it up more. The contract was signed in January, and two weeks prior to the wedding, hotel staff informed us that they had booked another party for the same night on the Roof, and that the wedding party would be moved elsewhere (to a far inferior setting). Had there been more time, the wedding would have been rescheduled at another venue, but two weeks does not allow for booking a large event elsewhere. The hotel knew this and used it to their advantage. The hotel broke the contract and was unwilling to provide adequate alternatives, although you know had the bride and groom pulled out of the contract two weeks prior to the event, the hotel would have kept all their money. It was just a very disappointing experience, tainted by management's lackluster handling of the situation, which should have never occurred in the first place. The point of this review is to warn any party considering hosting an event at The Wit to enter any agreement cautiously and consider other options before committing.
