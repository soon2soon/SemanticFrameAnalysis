I stayed at this hotel with my grand daughter in order to have the "Chicago" experience. The room was very large and the beds were quite comfortable. We both had an excellent night's rest. Everything within the room as well as the bathroom was quite clean and very spa like. Finding a hotel that makes staying with a three year old easy to do is most comforting. I was very impressed with the friendliness of the down stairs staff. As an elderly lady manipulating a stroller and packages I really appreciated the doorman who always helped me from outside the building up to the elevator. The front desk staff gave us accurate information on taking public transportation to Navy Pier.The hotel is located in a central location. I felt safe walking to Michigan Avenue at dusk as well as the next morning. I would truly recommend this hotel when visiting Chicago even with small children. They work their hardest to make you feel well taken care off.
