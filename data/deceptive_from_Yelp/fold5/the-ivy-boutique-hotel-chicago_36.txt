The hotel was nice. The room was nice. But for a hotel of this stature, at the price we paid, you would think they would pay a cleaning person to properly clean the shower. We found two PUBIC HAIRS on the shower wall. This isn't the Red Roof in, this is supposed to be an upscale, posh experience. GROSS! The Radisson Blue was a much nicer experience for us.
