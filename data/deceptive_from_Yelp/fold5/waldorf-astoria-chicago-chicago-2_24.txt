I will never recomend or use this hotel for anything. Long story short, they had us enter into a contract for our wedding, then as soon as it was signed, they backed out and started changing details. This was a very small wedding, immediate family only, so even the smallest detail was something big. I cannot fathom how a hotel with this name brand would think it OK to screw around with someones wedding day. Sean and his staff were dishonest, rude and either spoke over me during conversations, or in Sean's case, resorted to flat out yelling at me over the phone. It was overall a terrible experience trying to get this booked. From Rick (the GM of the hotel) to Sean (the Sales Manager) on down, I'm not sure I trust them to host any event.
