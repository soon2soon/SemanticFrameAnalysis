Inn Manor is a very nice B&B, refurbished with love by it's owner Angie & Mell Monroe, at the Southside of Chicago in Bronzeville. If you are interested in a well-preserved historical building, hospitality, a good breakfast and if you like to meet nice People from all over the world, that's the place to go.
