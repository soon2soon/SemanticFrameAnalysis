I had a totally awesome experience, all I have to say is you really get what you pay for here. It's a definite 4-star hotel. It's not mind-blowing but it's a million times better than any chain. All the food is very expensive but I truly wouldn't expect anything else from a place like this. The rooftop bar is really nice. I just got back from my stay, and I see the 1-star review from Krissy H. from about the same time I was there. Everything about her review (minibar, towels) sounds accurate, but I am very surprised about the alleged theft. Yikes! I left cash sitting out in my room and had no problem, I am really sorry to hear about that and hope it is resolved. My only complaints: -No pool/hot tub/bathtub. I understand that they probably had to give up a pool for the bar but a bathtub would have been nice. -No fridge or microwave. But again, it's 4 star and everything that is in the room is very nice. Bottom line: Dress nice, carry yourself well (and your wallet even better), and they will treat you like a valued guest. I would DEFINITELY stay here again! Location is not bad either.
