Me and my boyfriend were looking for something different to do for our Anniversary and this was what we chose. It was such a good time!  We made reservations the day of for the last Tour at 7pm on a Saturday.  We were able to get those reservations  in with no problem and the place where they pick you up is very easy to find. I recommend doing a reservation because the line was long and those without reservations took whatever seats were available after those with reservations took our seats. The trip is kind of long but you learn so much it's really not an issue. The host is hilarious and knows his stuff. The bus drops you right back off where you were picked up. If you drive there, there is a parking lot on Ontario that is only $15 for 6 hours. Not bad!
