My family and I normally go to the Four Seasons in Chicago for our annual yearly visit, but this time we decided to go someplace else. As soon as we walked into the lobby, we were greeted by the bright, smiling faces of the employees even in the wee hours of the night. We were checked in and situated into our rooms in a matter of minutes and were welcomed with the sight of a comfy couch and a plate full of fruit! The rooms were a lot more roomy than the Four Seasons and the room service was immaculate. We'll definitely be staying here again :)
