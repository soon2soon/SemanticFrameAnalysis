My husband I recently had the opportunity to visit Chicago over a beautiful Fall weekend in October.  Our Sat. morning was free and we wanted to roam about and experience the lakefront/downtown area. Since it was close (we stayed in Roscoe Village) and because it looked fun, we inquired about renting electric bikes for our adventure.  The guys at the shop were so helpful and patient with us since we were not familiar with electric bikes.  The process was easy but they made sure we we're comfortable before we went on our way.  When we left, we rode through Lincoln Park, passed the Lincoln Park Zoo then crossed over to the lakefront and rode down to Millennium Park.  We then had lunch downtown at an outside café and then rode back.  I think we rode almost 20 miles! What an AWESOME experience!  Don't hesitate, we had a blast. The bikes are so fun and you can pedal as much or as little as you want.  I have not ridden a bike in years and was a bit hesitant at fist.  Don't make the same assumption!  We had a great time and would highly recommend renting electric bikes to anyone looking to experience Chicago in a unique way.
