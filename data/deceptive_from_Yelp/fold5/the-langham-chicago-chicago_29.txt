We just went there to have some "TEA", our waitress was phenomenal! Can't remember her name - she was a very cute Asian girl- I think she goes to school too, and works there part time? - she was awesome, the teas were delicious and the pastries and lil sandwiches were really tasty, the prosecco was quite good too! I will definitely go back We went there today "Easter Sunday" Thank u guys!
