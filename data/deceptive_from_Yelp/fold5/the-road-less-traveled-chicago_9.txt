I have worked for RLT for the last few years and have had the opportunity to travel all across the US, India and Central America with them.  Every year I can't wait to talk to the office and find out where I might be able to go.   Another thing that I also get excited for every year is being able to talk to all of the kids and their parents before leaving for my trip(s) during the summer.  It is such a unique and fulfilling experience as a leader to really get to know not only my students, but their families as well.  Over the last few summers I have even had the opportunity to work with some of the same students and really see how they have grown and developed over the last few years.   RLT provides so many amazing opportunities to travel, experience other people and cultures and expand your own way of thinking and perspective on the world around you.  Whether staying stateside for the summer or traveling half way around the world, for one week or one month, RLT will always provide amazing and life changing experiences for its staff and students alike!
