Upon arrival we were told our room rate was $179 per night. Â They failed to tell us that they also charged us $219 "in case we order breakfast" I was told when asked later (my bank notified me of the total charge, not the staff behind the desk). We stayed here last summer when it was Hotel 71 and it was great, since then it has changed and I will NEVER BE BACK, Our carpet was torn, the beds were like sleeping on concrete, there was a lot of hair on the bathroom floor and in the tub and there was also blood on the back of the bathroom door and wall. There was candy wrappers and garbage in the room, my kids do a better job at cleaning up! It is a great location, but there are many others to pick from for next time. When I went down to complain this morning, I was told "thank you for letting us know", they did nothing to satisfy the customer and this is why I am only giving them one star. Dawn K
