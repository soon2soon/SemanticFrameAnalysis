A gem of a hotel. Central for Chicago Theater, Symphony Hall and Millenium Park. Â No need to book at either nearby Hilton. We stayed on Saturday night, room 613 King suite booked through great deal on Tingo. Restaurant closed for renovation but your choice of cuisine and level of dining is right out the front door. Your not staying in anyway are you? Neighborhood is as safe as any downtown locale. Bed was really comfy, heaven to sink into. Linens and towels are fantastic! Every staff member we encountered was helpful and pleasant. Mohammed at the door, Patty at the desk was delightful, Ariel answered all room reservation questions. Reserved 24 hr parking at 124 S. Wabash (1 1/2 blocks away) through Spot Hero for $30.00.
