We needed a limo short notice...vip came through with a beautiful white escalde! The limo driver (mark) was on time...early even, charming, a safe driver, and so patient with our group! Everything went perfectly! I recommend VIP to anyone and everyone! You get nervous organizing an event with a limo...but this was nothing short of amazing. Everyone had a blast! Will be calling again!
