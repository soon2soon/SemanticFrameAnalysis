This trip was to visit our son and celebrate our anniversary. This is a lovely historic hotel.  Even the elevators seem to take you back in time. The room was comfortable and very clean, but it was the view of the frozen lake in March that wowed me!  I love a good view.  Ask for a higher floor on the NE side of the building. There are a few signs that this isn't a brand new hotel (showing a little age) and that just added to the experience I think.  The staff was wonderful and even surprised us with Champagne and strawberries. Check out the Coq D'Or  on the lower floor for delicious seafood and a little 40's movie star atmosphere .Definitely a keeper on my list of the best Chicago Hotels.
