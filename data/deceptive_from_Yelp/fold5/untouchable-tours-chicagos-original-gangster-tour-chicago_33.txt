If you are from out of town I recommend looking for a more reliable company to go on tour with. We booked out Untouchable tour weeks before we flew to Chicago for a quick trip in the windy city. I surprised my husband with this tour, but the night of we waited in the cold outside Mcdonald's for almost an hour. Turns out the tour was cancelled, but the company only tried to get ahold of me at the very last minute, and because we were travelling we didn't turn on our roaming. The company was great at giving us back out refund, but we wasted a full night during out trip, money on travelling downtown and we didn't have time to rebook any other tours. We were Â both extremely disappointed, and I wouldn't want that to happen to you! Other couples we met on the trip booked tours through other companies, and they didn't have any issues.
