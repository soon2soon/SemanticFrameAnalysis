Five Star, Five Star, Five Star. I've stayed in hotels worldwide - The Langham is right there with the best. Simple Elegance, Modern, Fine, unpretentious.   Fairly New and CLEAN. Consistent Refined Customer Service throughout our stay. Worth every penny. GREAT location - walkable to many of Chicago's fine things to do and see. The Pavillion tea room is understated luxury. A mention goes to Miss Washington who first greeted us upon entering the building with a warm welcome of professionalism and class.  She set the tone for our decision to choose The Langham over the other top rated hotels in Chicago. I consider the Langham to be the finest hotel in Chicago, We will come back again!
