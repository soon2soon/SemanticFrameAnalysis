I really enjoyed my tour.  I tasted some great food--of course-- but I also learned a lot about Chicago.  Things I didn't know about downtown.  We had Pizza at Pizano's, brats and rootbeer at Berghoff's, gumbo at heaven on 7, a Chicago dog at Gold Coast.  my favorite may have been the boutique cupcake shop opened up by a young U of Chicago graduate--Sugar Bliss.  This didn't feel like a tourist thing.  I was experiencing downtown Chicago Culture.   Other highlights: visiting the Palmer House--Wow! Beautiful.  We had enough time to go inside the Chicago Cultural Center.  What a gem.  My Chicago friends haven't even been there.  Tastebud's logos and art are by a workshop of special needs folks in residence at the CCC.   What I loved about this tour is that you can eat as much you want.  There is no pressure to stuff your face but if you want to have a full meal there is more than enough and no one will bat an eye.   Our guide was smart, funny, responsive, created a great group atmosphere.   I went home and told all my friends.   it was really easy to make a reservation.  I really don't like it when  websites are difficult or when you can't get a call back.  These guys care about your whole experience.  That made a difference to me.
