We hired Windy City for our wedding this August. The trolley was very nice and extremely clean. Our wedding party (21 people total) fit very comfortably and many would say it was a highlight of the day. We had such a great time hanging out before the reception on the trolley. I would recommend the company get a little better about quick responses but all in all they were fairly easy to deal with. I had to give them five stars however for our driver. If you get the chance definitely request Cliff to be your trolley driver. He was the perfect host, Â making several stops for us along the way to pick up more "beverages." I even had our photographer be sure to get a picture of Cliff and I! I highly recommend Windy City Trolley for any special event! Thanks!
