I have stayed at many hostels around the world and this one is definitely one of the best. If you want to feel relaxed, comfortable, safe and clean, then this is the place for you. It doesn't have that hostel, 'everyone be best friends' vibe, but I liked that. It was quiet and clean, which is what I look for. Like I said, it's very clean and comfortable and close to the blue line which takes you downtown.
