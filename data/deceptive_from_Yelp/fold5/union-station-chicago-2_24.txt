I had an awful coustemer service experience here. I was attempting to travel as an unaccompanied minor and when my mum and I went to check me in they bounced us from agent to agent so we had to walk all over. Once we got to the agent we were actually supposed to be at she told us I couldn't take the train. When we asked why she told us that the station I was attempting to go to (centralia) was not staffed and they wouldn't send me there. This information was not on the website, nor was it given to us over the phone. When we asked why this information was not presented to us when we purchased the tickets, the woman who was helping us freaked out! She was not helpful at all, she raised her voice and continued repeating that she couldn't let me go. After about a minute of this she told us that she would have to go get a manager. When she returned the manager quite literally stuck his head out the door and yelled that he was in a conference call and couldn't deal with us. He restated what the woman had said to is and then went back into his office. We were ushered back to where we started so that we could cancel the ticket and begrudgingly given the paper that would give us the information to allow us to call to make a formal complaint. When we went back to the desk they were a bit more helpful, at the very least a bit more pleasant, but not much. And we got our refund but not without quite a hassle. The service here was awful and the employees were very rude. We were offered no form of help and had to force the information for a complaint out of them. It was a waste of our time and effort and I would not recommend this to anyone!
