The hotel was beautiful but the nightclub ruined the experience.  It was SO loud that I could not fall asleep until after it closed at 3am.  The hoards of club goers at the main entrance made it hard to get in and out and the cigarette smoke around the entrance was nasty.  The elevator would stop on the 4th floor and would fill up with drunk people leaving the club.  Clearly this hotel has no concern for the rest of those paying big bucks to stay there.  What a shame.
