The rooms and public areas are nice enough, but wow, staying here is a lesson in bad ethics.  I was told at checkout that I had no charges but found a $30 charge on my credit card later.  When I called, I was told it was for the mini bar.  What the heck?  First, we didn't touch the mini bar because we didn't see one!  I noticed two bottles of water and one bottle of Red Bull on the sink when we checked in.  We brought all of our own food and water, so I never gave it a second thought until I was charged for it.  What in the world?  Check your credit card statement religiously if you take the gamble to stay here. Also, I was traveling with my teen daughter, and both of us were shocked at the behavior of the adults heading to the club each night.  The language and actions were colorful to say the least. When I found out about the club, I wasn't too concerned because I teach college and figured it would be like a big frat party.  I just thought college kids liked to party.  I was embarrassed for the actions of some of these people, and it was only 10:00 pm (opening time) when we encountered them.   If you have young children (or morals), stay away! I hate that the billing issue caused me to drop the stars because despite the colorful behavior, I would have rated it pretty well otherwise.  It is clean and fairly centrally located.  I have read too many reviews about being billed for services that did not happen to think it is a coincidence.  Hopefully they will figure out this is not a good business practice and figure out another way to gouge consumers soon.
