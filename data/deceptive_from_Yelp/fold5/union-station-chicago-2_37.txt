If your traveling at a great distance the train is always better then driving especially when gas is more expensive then milk....4 dollars a gallon.....hurting...I took the metra to go visit my 5 month pregnant sister and brother-in-law in Aurora! I get on the morning train i think it was like 9:30 and i got there in exactly an hour and ten minutes....Most importantly i was just chilling....not driving.....not paying attention to others driving...just literally chilling....read the whole paper...Every article in the Sports section and then enjoyed the scenery.....People on the train are even cool as i started talking to a Cub fan (what up Tom) He knew i was a Cub fan because i was wearing my Soriano jersey and we just started talking about there amazing season.... On the way back there wasn't as any stops as the train didn't stop at every station....it was only a 45 minute ride back... Overall the train is cheaper....faster....safer then driving....
