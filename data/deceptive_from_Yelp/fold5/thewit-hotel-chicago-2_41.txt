I stayed here a few years ago, in 2009, and then again, this past weekend. The first experience was a decent one; this one was only ok. Although the staff is very friendly, the concierge hugely misdirected us to a place on the opposite side of town we were trying to go and didn't offer to call ahead for us; we arrived at the restaurant and there was an hour and a half wait. On another night, we decided to call down to the concierge and tried four times and no one answered. Another issue was that our thermostat was stuck on 82 overnight and we were burning up. Finally, they need to not use down pillows. They are hard as a rock. Otherwise it is a cute and nice hotel.
