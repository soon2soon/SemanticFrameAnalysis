My 16 year old son went on the RLT Call of the Wild trip during the 2014 summer and would say it was one of the greatest experiences of his life.  He especially loved the 8 days they spent at Mission:Wolf -- working hard (!) and learning so much about the wolves that he could not stop talking about them when he returned.  The staff was fantastic; they did a great job of leading the kids through numerous adventures and activities that, especially for my son, were outside their comfort zone.  He even enjoyed camping out and cooking meals, which was a very new experience for him.  Bravo to RLT!
