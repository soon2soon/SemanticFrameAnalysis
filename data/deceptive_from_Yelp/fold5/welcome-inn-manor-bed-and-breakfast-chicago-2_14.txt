My girlfriend and I were looking for a weekend getaway in the city, and she told me to check out this place because a friend of hers recently stayed there.  I went to their website and instantly fell in love with rooms and the overall decoration of the house.  She was hesitant to stay at a B&B, but once we arrived and met Mell she was instantly at ease.  The owners Mell and Angie were very personable; the house instantly puts you at ease and is so full of Chicago history.  The atmosphere was very relaxing, the Nat King Cole suit was well worth the money, and the food was excellent...Mell and Angie we will definitely be back.
