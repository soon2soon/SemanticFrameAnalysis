I was very pleased with the location of this hotel. We were walking distance to the Miracle Mile, Millennium Park, Willis Tower and transportation. The grounds were well maintained, especially thankful for that since we had snow. The door man was very cheerful, greeted us daily and offered assistance when needed. The room was very clean and had a fabulous view! The two queen beds were comfortable and the sitting area with separate desk was the perfect size. I liked that we had a personal Keurig & mini fridge as well as plenty of outlets and free wifi. The only down sides for me was that there were no other "perks" that I would expect to have for the price we paid such as continental breakfast, airport shuttle, etc. I also didn't appreciate the maid knocking until I actually got up to let her know that we were still sleeping at 8:30am on a Sunday morning. It wasn't a light tap, she actually kept knocking until she woke me up. Then she came back an hour later and I let her know we'd be out of the room soon. After all that she didn't clean the room until 6:30pm! The walls are actually pretty thin as well. We could here drunk girls arguing in the next room and people using the ice machine. I would stay again but request a room away from the ice machine & elevators and remember to hang the "do not disturb" sign.
