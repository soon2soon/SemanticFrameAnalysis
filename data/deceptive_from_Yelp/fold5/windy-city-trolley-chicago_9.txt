I had an absolutely terrible experience with Windy City Trolley.  They showed up almost over a half hour late and then were extremely rude to us.  Our driver was unprofessional and seemed very inexperienced.  I also received the same type of service with everyone else I dealt with at Windy City Trolley and was appalled at an email that was sent by Nicole Heavrin.  It was so unprofessional.  I highly recommend that you don't use this company if you want to ensure everyone will have a pleasant & stress free evening!
