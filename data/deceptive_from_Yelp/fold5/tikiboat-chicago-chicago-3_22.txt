was on the tikboat in chicago for a bachelorette party, it was so totally fun.  Capt. Mark who we hired because we didn't have enough boating experience to just rent the boat out ourselves was a blast!   He blasted the music but then turned it down when he needed to tell us something & the best thing is that we went to the 'play pen'  (that area just north of navy pier where all the boats anchor), where we met other boats who anchored right next to the tikiboat which we walked boat to boat and met new friends.  Definitely you need to call Paul Newman (that's really his name by the way) the owner of the tikiboat---not sure what that other yelper thought about niko & chris having the boat---but Paul was great on the phone explaining how its a rental that you can go where you want but need to hire a captain.
