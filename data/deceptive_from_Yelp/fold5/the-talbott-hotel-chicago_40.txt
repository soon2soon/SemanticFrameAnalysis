The Talbott was nothing but a pleasant surprise.  I didn't have any specific expectations about this place.  It turned out to be perfect.  It reminds me of one of the wonderful boutique hotels we have stayed at in Paris. The only bad thing I can say is that our room was very dark because our view was that of another building. But I don't hold that against them.  That's the nature of big city downtown hotels sometimes.   The room was well appointed and the service was excellent.  Truly excellent.  Probably the best overall service I have ever had at any hotel (bell staff, front desk staff, concierge, housekeeping, etc.)!
