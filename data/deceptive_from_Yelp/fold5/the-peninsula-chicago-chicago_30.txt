The lobby at the Penisula was beautiful.  We had a wonderful ladies luncheon for 8 people.  The service was wonderful along with the food.  We had the option of ordering high tea or just lunch.  Everyone was very pleased with the afternoon.  The prices were reasonable for high tea with a glass of champagne.  Everything else added up quickly because each cocktail was on the pricey side.   The service was impeccable and the china that was used for high tea was beautiful.  We really enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay there next time we spend a weekend in the city.
