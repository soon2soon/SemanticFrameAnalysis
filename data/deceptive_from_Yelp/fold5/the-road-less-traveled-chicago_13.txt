I went on a RLT trip in the summer of 2013. It was truly an amazing experience! The trip I went on was Call of the Wild and through the trip I met many wonderful people and learned fascinating new things! Learning from people who worked with the wolves firsthand was something that I will never forget. Everyone at RLT (from leaders to participant to the people who work in the office) were always kind, lovely, and informative. If a participant was not used to something or didn't understand something the leaders were always supportive and explained whatever questions we had. The experience is one that I will not forget! Thank you RLT for an experience that made this the best summer ever and for allowing me to discover what service means to me. I would highly recommend RLT!
