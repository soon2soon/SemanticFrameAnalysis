We saw this crazy boat at the Chicago Scene party. They had the DJs on it. In August a group of us pitched in and went out for a Sunday afternoon. We ended up extending the rental and extra hour and heading down the Chicago River. Â I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to have fun out on the water. Next time we may try a beach trip. Pros: The boat is very clean, it has a real toliet (we were on a boat one time that didn't). The captain and crew were very attentive and fun, I was suprised they threw in ice for free. Cons: We drove down in 4 cars and it's some what expensive to park in the area (but then again what part of downtown isn't.) Next time we will cab it.
