My husband and I love Paris and wanted to spend some time there and then take the Euro-rail  to London and then make the Transatlantic crossing from South Hampton to New York and return to Chicago.  We began to research the planning process and quickly recognized we were in over our heads. How do we coordinate the transfers and keep track of the time change etc.?  YIKES! We picked up the phone and called Kathy at Windy City Travel and in, what seemed like moments, all arrangements were complete.  We were still nervous and she assured us we had no worries and Kathy was right!  We had a flawless vacation.  Her planning, communication and connections with all the folks with whom we worked, made our trip complete perfection.   Kathy made sure all the details were clear and left nothing to chance.  To all you Internet planners out there---(I was too)---put down your mouse and call Kathy. Bon voyage! Michael and Jill
