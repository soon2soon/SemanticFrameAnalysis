We stayed in this Bed & Breakfast 6 days during our business trip and it was exceptional experience. We stayed in the third floor and it was very comfortable even for three colleagues. Mell and Â Angie was very friendy and helpfull. The breakfast was absolutely phenomenal, Mell suprised us every day. The best business trip ever :)
