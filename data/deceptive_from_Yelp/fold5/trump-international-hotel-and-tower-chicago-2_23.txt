This place has a beautiful atmosphere, especially sitting outdoors. I didn't like the fact that we bought a drink in the indoor bar while we were waiting for our outdoor table and we were not allowed to take it with us once our outdoor table was ready. The service was a little over the top, I felt like the servers were trying so desperately hard to please. The view of Chicago is amazing as the sun sets.
