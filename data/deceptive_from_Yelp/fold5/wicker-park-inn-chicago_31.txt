Spent a night there on a Groupon. Mostly because we wanted to soak up the ambience of Bucktown/ Wicker Park area. It was pleasant & clean, but for the regular price, I would not say it was a "do again". Unless it was just being used as a place to crash rather than drive back to the burbs, it was "homey" but not conducive to a romantic evening. Too much noise from the el, we were right next to the breakfast room, so the lights shown in through the door & the early morning scurrying about prevented sleeping in. Not a bad experience, but not a do again. The breakfast was mostly pastries, so we went out to breakfast instead. I was disappointed in the Cape Cod room. Maybe I was expecting more than I should have. On the positive side, staff was very nice & helpful.
