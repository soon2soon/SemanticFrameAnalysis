We took the Wrigley Field tour and loved it. Our guide was very informative and stopped many times along the way. He had a microphone so we all could hear while riding. I would highly recommend this in fact I wish we knew the day before when we walked all over Chicago. It was very easy we rode for15 miles and we both are over 50 and don't normally ride. We both were not sure if we should do this tour or Segway and we made the right choice this was easy but far more personal. Â Give them a shot you wont regret it.
