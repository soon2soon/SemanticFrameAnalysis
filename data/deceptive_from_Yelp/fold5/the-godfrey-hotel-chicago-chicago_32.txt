I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay at this hotel again. A group of us went to Chicago last weekend for a girls getaway and were very disappointed in the staff that was working the Saturday afternoon that we checked in. The front desk staff (all women) were nothing but rude, and unhelpful in every aspect. Reservations were not correct when we got arrived and and wrong charges were made to two of our bills. We were really impressed by our bellman, the night staff at the front desk (all men), and the rooms and location however it is not enough to make us come back or recommend this hotel after having to start out our experience being treated extremely poorly.
