It was awesome.  We were treated like royalty by the staff and the hotel was great and safe as well.  Anything we needed they had or got.  This was an emergent visit for us and their staff made a hard time so much better.  The three bell hops on days and Pedro, Sal, Tiffany, and John made us feel like their family.  Crowne Plaza is lucky to have such an outstanding staff and hotel.  Hang on to them they're are very few people left like them.  Thank you for your hospitality and we will always stay with you if we come again.  Y'all rock.  i told all my people from Georgia as well:)
