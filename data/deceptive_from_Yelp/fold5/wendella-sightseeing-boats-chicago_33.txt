A visiting friend and I did the architecture tour. There are phenomenal views even on a cloudy day. I recently moved to Chicago, so I am really trying to get to know my new city. Obviously the city is beautiful, but knowing about the history makes it even better. Our tour guide was knowledgable--even recommended books to read--and personable. I will definitely be back.
