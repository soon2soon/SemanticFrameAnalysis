Located right in the heart of Lincoln Park, this B&B was the perfect place for a weekend stay in Chicago.  The kitchen was loaded with delicious goodies, (I was especially fond of the homemade chocolate chip chunk cookies) and in the morning we woke up to an Italian egg casserole, OJ, Intelligentsia coffee, and Belgium waffles. We stayed in the Florencia Suite, which had two comfy beds and a fireplace, as well as a large plasma screen TV and satellite television.    Every room in the house was spotless and we felt very comfortable.  The service was friendly and helpful, making us feel right and home, and outside there was a large patio with a Jacuzzi.  Next time we'll have to come during the summer so we can use the barbecue grill they have available.
