I used the service to get a tourist visa to russia.  I went to the office to submit the paper work and find out I was missing some documents.  As guided filled out the online form to acquire the invitation letter from the tourist agency.  Then I went the next day to submit the paper work and find out I was missing the Global registration form which was not mention to me at my first visit.  Since I was close to my travel date I expedite the visa application to 3-5 business days.  When I called to checked the status they told me I was not going to get my passport till next monday even though i submitted the paper work on Friday the week before and submitted the registration form on the following Monday.  They charged me the fee for 3-5 business day processing but giving me the passport on the 7th business day.  Very disappointed!  Will never ever use the service again!!!! what a rip off.... Better off submitting the application to the consulate.
