I found the staff to be very friendly and easy to talk to on the water since we did an intimate fireworks tour.  Make sure you wear the right clothing because the river water is not the nicest.  We actually ran into another kayak company's group on the water who's instructors sounded like army generals and I was glad to be with Wateriders!  I am excited to do the architectural tour in the near future.
