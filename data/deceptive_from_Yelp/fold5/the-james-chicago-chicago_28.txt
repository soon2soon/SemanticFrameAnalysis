I stayed here for the third time last week and I have enjoyed my previous stays.  But this time I left less refreshed than I arrived.  There was a problem with the water pipes that meant anytime anyone near our room used their bathroom our pipes started to wheeze and bang.  Even on the second night after I had asked the front desk to fix it.  The guy at reception could not have cared less when I asked so I was not surprized it repeated. Be careful of the fruit at breakfast as I found a maggot on a raspberry en-route to my mouth.  They brought me a new bowl (no thanks) and comped just my oatmeal out.  Then a manager came over and said, "Sorry about  the berries" while looking at a spot over my left shoulder and walking off without letting us reply.  I probably would not have posted if that final touch hadnt happened. Overall the location is good, some of the staff are geat, but it's very inconsistent. The rooms are average for comfort, it's a little cramped.  And just be wary of that fruit.
