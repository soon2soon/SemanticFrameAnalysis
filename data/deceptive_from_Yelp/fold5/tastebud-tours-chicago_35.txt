I took the downtown tour with Mimi a couple weeks ago and thought it was great.  It was the first day of my Chicago stay, so it was a very good introduction to food, history, architecture and allowed me to ask any and all touristy questions I had.  Mimi was very knowledgeable and friendly and the owner Lynn fell into step with us a couple times, which is the sign of a good businessman (He even told me where I could find Fighting Ilini stuff I was looking for). I enjoyed all the food, but was glad that it was only a part of the whole experience.  To those yelpers who are complaining about Tastebud Tours, I would say do your research before booking.  My tour was exactly as advertised and more.
