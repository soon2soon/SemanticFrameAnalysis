since I am writing reviews today, I have to write one for the Waldorf. My review is long overdue. I took my spouse here for our anniversary this past year and it lived up to our expectations. Within walking distance of great restaurants and nightlife, rooms were quiet and beds comfortable. the shower for two was luxurious. The hotel bar had top shelf liquor and the clientele was classy. Highly recommend this hotel for the perfect romantic get away. Elevators are a little slow..but maybe its to savor the experience :)
