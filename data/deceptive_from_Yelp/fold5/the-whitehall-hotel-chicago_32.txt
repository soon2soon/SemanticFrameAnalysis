If you are looking for a prime location near all the action at a reasonable price with decent rooms and great service, then you've come to the right place. I happened upon this hotel when looking to book rooms via CheapTickets and got a super price, after the additional discount for a weeknight. The king size bed was very comfortable and cozy. The staff went the extra mile and were very efficient. I will gladly book a return visit :)
