I am a grad student with a family and planning on travel to Europe for six months. Because of where I live, I have to use the consulate in Chicago for an extended-stay visa. I first clicked on the live chat link, which told me I was first in line. After 5 minutes I called. I spoke to Diane, Lucy, George and Marta, neither of whom could answer my questions. George, the most dickish of them all. My questions pertained to something we had heard about the apostille of the Hague stamp on the birth certificates, what visa do the dependents apply for (there's a dependent area of the application on the student visa, but George seemed to feel that if my 3-year old wasn't studying then dependents shouldn't be listed on the student visa). There's a place to post 'research questions' for $20. We posted 5 questions, many of them pertinent to the questions that the phone calls or website couldn't procure. We got back the equivalent of a screen shot of one of their web pages. I don't know about other visa companies, but I will make sure everyone on earth (which, for me right now, is one of the largest land-grant universities in the nation) knows not to waste their money with this company. TERRIBLE SERVICE!
