Stayed at the hotel a few times trying different rooms.  If you can pop for a special night request a unit that ends in 32.  The 1600 square foot rooms is spectacular, with the afternoon sun softly coming in and a killer view down the river.  I think the terrace bar (when open) is the best view in the city.  The staff, which has the potential to be snooty, really is not and I find them to be great.
