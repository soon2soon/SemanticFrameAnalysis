My friends and I met up for a girls weekend in the city.   We went on Tastebud Tours and not only had a great time trying different foods of Chicago but also seeing the city.  Our tour guide, Lynn, not only told us history of the city but fun facts that are great to know!  It was a great way to spend the afternoon with good friends and good food! I have lived in Chicago for almost 3 years and have not had time to try Pizzano's Pizza, or a Chicago Style Hotdog!!! Even as a local, this tour was great to experience what great resturants that Chicago has to offer! I have recommended going to many of the restaurants to my friends and family after the tour....Pizzano's Pizza is now my favorite pizza in the city!!
