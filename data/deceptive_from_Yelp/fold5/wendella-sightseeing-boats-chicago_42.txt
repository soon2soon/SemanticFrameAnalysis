In my opinion, the WENDELLA BOAT TOUR is a prefect program you need to take if you want to explore Chicago. It is a 75 minutes tour. From this tour you can see the all branches of the CHICAGO RIVER. Also, you can see the whole view of CHICAGO form the LAKE MICHIGN. The tall buildings which were under the sky were so beautiful. The breeze from the great lake made me happy. The guide was also very good. Although his speaking speed was so fast, I could not understand some words he said. What I understood was also interesting. In conclusion, if you have time, you should go to take the tour.
