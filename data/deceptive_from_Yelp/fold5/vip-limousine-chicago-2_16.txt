My family and I did a holiday lights tour last night . What a great time and awesome service!  We didn't really know where we wanted to go, but they have a whole schedule of stops you can choose from for the tour.  The last stop was at an AMAZING hot chocolate place where all of us got the best hot chocolate we have ever had per their suggestion!  Thanks so much!  My family and I will definitely be using you again and sending all our friends your way!
