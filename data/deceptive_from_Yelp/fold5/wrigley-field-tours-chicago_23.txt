WORST STADIUM TOUR EVER! I have been to many MLB Stadium tours and on the Wrigley tour twice now. The first time was great and I enjoyed it very much. The second time the tour consisted of moving to different seats in the ballpark while the guide told stories. Besides the Press Box, every other area of the tour can be accessed at any time before, during or after the game. Â The $25 per ticket is reasonable for adults but charging $25 for a child under the age of 5 is ridiculous. Friendly Confines? Maybe. Family Friendly Confines? Absolutely not!
