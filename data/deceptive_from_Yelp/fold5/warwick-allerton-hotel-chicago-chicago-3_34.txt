My experience at the Allerton Hotel in July 2013 was a mixed bag.   The location was wonderful and the room, although not what I booked, was doable.  I booked a two queen room through Priceline.  When we arrived no two queen rooms were available so they offered an upgrade to a king suite, but it wouldn't be available for an hour and a half.  We returned two hours later, still no king suite available so we settled on a double with a roll away.  The front desk staff left us standing there while waiting on other guests and gave the impression we were a real bother.  When we checked out, the same staff member tried to charge me for the rollaway.  The final straw was when I received my credit card bill in July with a charge of $740 for a reservation that had been paid through Priceline in April.  I called the hotel and they did agree to credit the $740 back to my account.  The remainder of the staff was very accommodating, but after this experience, I will not book there again.
