I am a regular customer of Top Fleet with a major financial services firm in the city and rely on both timely service and reliable drivers for client meetings both in Chicago and the far north suburbs. Top Fleet has met our high corporate standards and has done it at a lower price point vs. many of the other competitors in IL. Additionally, when we have to send cars to our top clients we can chose from a wide range of luxury cars depending on the importance of the client and trust they are in good hands which is an important part of the client experience.
