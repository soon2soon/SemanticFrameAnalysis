Uncrabby Cabby is the only taxi service that would schedule a pick-up time. Every other cab service I called in the Chicago area would tell me to call back an hour before I needed a cab. Considering I needed to get several people to airports for outgoing flights, I couldn't risk booking a cab one hour before the pick-up time. Phil managed to guarantee me a cab with 24 hours notice. When I called back to request a 6-person pick-up (less than 24 hour notice) he ensured they had a ride as well. I then had one more last minute change and needed a third pickup for three additional travelers. Phil added another car and they arrived just a few minutes behind schedule. This is a great service and worth every penny. (Oh and they were incredibly patient and polite even when I was not.)
