Spent one night for our anniversary, was upgraded to lake view that was gorguous at night and and day. When we returned to our room after dinner we were surprised to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Wonderful location at the top of Michigan Ave, a short walk to Chicago attractions. Hotel was beautiful and met all my expectations and more. Staff was helpful and very friendly.
