There was no nice welcome from the head manager. He was very rude in the way he spoke to us, telling us to just grab a life vest and head outside. By the time we kayaked back, no one was waiting at the dock for us. We had to maneuver ourselves and the kayak onto the dock by ourselves, and were soaked in the process. And when we returned the life vests, not even a "thanks for coming" or anything. The one old employee with the shaved head, was too busy flirting with four twenty some year old girls... He seemed to have a big welcoming smile for them. Basically that company is a joke and the people working there are even bigger jokes! You run a kayak tour business lol, if you want to act like big shots, get a REAL job!
