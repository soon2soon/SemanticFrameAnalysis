We would book through Windy City Travel and use Marcie again in a heartbeat!   We just returned from our destination wedding in Mexico and everything went exactly as planned.  Marcie at coordinated our trip along with our 41 of our 49 guests!   I did not have a chance to meet with Marcie in person, and so she organized everything via email and phone for me.  THIS WAS A HUGE BENEFIT TO ME!  She faxed me the necessary documents that required a signature and emailed me everything else for my records.  She always answered every question that I had-which was a feat in and of itself as I had a million questions!  Being the slightly unorganized person that I am, I was surprised she kept her patience with me! Even though we did not book all of our flights through Apple, Marcie took our flight information in order to coordinate shuttle service to our resort.  We did not realize what a plus this was until the people in our group that booked via the internet waited for a shuttle that never showed up!   The internet is very easy to use and offers deals on travel, but it is nearly impossible to reach someone when something goes wrong.  For travel of this nature, we wanted to ensure we could call someone if something were to go wrong.   Thank you Marcie and Windy City Travel!
