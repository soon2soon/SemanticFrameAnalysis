The hotel is beautiful. We were impressed until we got to the room and found out that the two beds we had requested were TWIN beds. I did not know any hotels had twin beds anymore. We should of been told that on the phone . We had three people in our party so we went down to desk and talked to "Lorenzo" but he would not help us at all.
