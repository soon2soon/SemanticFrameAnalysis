My husband and I just returned from a 3-day stay at Villa D'Citta. It is truly a beautiful place with a very peaceful and comfortable atmosphere. Our suite was quite spacious and had all the amenities anyone would need. The decoration is classic and the kitchen was stocked with many,many breakfast items. Ralph is wonderful and very accommodating Whiskey (the mansion mascot) is so sweet and the best touch. The building is located in a cozy neighborhood in Lincoln Park with Starbucks, restaurants and great shopping all very close and within walking distance. We will be recommending to all of our friends and can't wait to go back!!!!
