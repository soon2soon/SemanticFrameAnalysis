We were about to rent the city bikes but realized we were limited to 30 minute intervals or pay an extra fee. We decided to go with WanderBikes and are glad we did. Â Loved the electric assist. Personable and friendly service by Brady and Tyler. We'll definitely use WanderBikes again when we return to Chicago.
