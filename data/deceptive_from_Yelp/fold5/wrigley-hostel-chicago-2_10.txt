Prior to Wrigley, I had stayed at a more upmarket and very large hostel and the experience between the two was like night and day! The very first thing you notice after being checked in by the fantastic staff is how warm and cosy the place is. When you're sitting in the common room it just feels like you're at home. It's the perfect place to unwind from your day of sightseeing, shopping etc and enjoy 'free pizza' while chatting and swapping stories with your fellow travelers. Most nights they have activities organised however, as I experienced, the super friendly staff are more than happy to arranged an impromptu activity based on suggestions from guests! The location is a stones throw from bars, eateries, transport and Wrigley Field. I stayed at Wrigley Hostel for 2 weeks and during that time I was always greeted by staff with a friendly smile and a warm conversation. The crew are fantastic and genuinely care about your experience at Wrigley Hostel. They have a quality suggestion box outside their check-in desk area, and I have seen many improvements during my stay. Great times, great company and made some great friends! Definitely recommend Wrigley Hostel
