I purchased my stay at The James Hotel for the weekend before Christmas.  It was a busy time of year, but the hotel was ready for the rush! The whole experience was lovely.  The hotel rooms were very clean, and there was even a table/reading nook area.  This was great, since the first night we arrived late and ate food in the room. I also got the chance to use the complimentary car service, and received a ride to a restaurant about two miles away.  It was cold, we were almost late for the reservation, so we we wanted to escape the walk.  The driver was friendly and knew exactly where the restaurant was. I would recommend this hotel to others.
