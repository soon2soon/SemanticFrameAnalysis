This place gets a star only because of it's prime location, otherwise, the service is terrible, the rooms look modern in the pictures but they're falling apart, the beds have a 1 ft walkway around it before you hit the wall or corners of the bed, the showers have half doors so you freeze every time you take a shower, and the wifi is slower than dial-up if you're lucky to get it to work.
