Great location, nice bathroom, decent rooms (large and clean, fine for sleeping in, but decor not anything you would want to look at, with a huge pillar next to one of the beds, view of roofs and a/c equipment), nice staff, good price.  Any noise in the hallway came right in through the large crack under the door to the room.  Didn't get the upgrade with yelp check-in -- they said it wasn't available.
