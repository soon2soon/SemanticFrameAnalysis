This place is really cool and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The hostel itself is clean and tidy, with fresh paint and lots of informational signs and posters. The common room has a great set up of comfortable seating, computers(only 2 were semi-fuctional) a pool/ ping pong table and a huge cable TV. The free towels, wi-fi, breakfast and pizza(every night at 6pm!!) were great. We loved that we could come and go as we pleased and the location was ideal for us- we went to catch a show at the Metro, which is basically up the street. There are plenty of great shopping and dining destinations within walking distance, which I loved. Â It was also easy to find the L station and bus stops. We also very much appreciated that the staff let us park our car in their small back parking lot when they ran out of street parking permits. On the downside, our room was fine but not very pleasant due to the fact that it was tucked away in a basement corner and located right next to the laundry/storage room. The room was cold and dank, with a little condensation on one wall right next to the beds we were assigned. There is no heating, except from a tiny bit of pipe across one corner of the ceiling, so it was very cold and uncomfortable the first night, but we were given a space heater the second night and it improved the situation a lot. We also had just one small powerstrip on our side of the room, because the room's other outlets did not work, so our roomates had to stretch their cellphone powercords across the floor at night....which was not ideal.The other bummer was that we were woken up early in the morning by a heated discussion between the desk staff and the cleaning staff...they were in the laundry room but we could hear every word. Uncomfortable. While I would absolutely stay at the Wrigley again, I would definitely opt for a private room or hopefully just not room number 7.
