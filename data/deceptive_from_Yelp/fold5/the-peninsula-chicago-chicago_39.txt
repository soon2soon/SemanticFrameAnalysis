The Peninsula is simply put a world class - premium hotel.  Sure, it's not cheap, but in all of our travels, this hotel seems able to keep its staff always at the top of their game.  A friendly smile from every staff member sets this destination apart from other locations like the Four Seasons. In our room, they don't leave an ironing board.  When my wife requested one, it was quickly retrieved and offered with a spray starch and even a sewing kit.  This type of go-the-extra step seems to happen at every request. Even the bellman was friendly and courteous while we awaited our cars retrieval from valet.  We si9mply cant wait until we return to Chicago and the Peninsula.
