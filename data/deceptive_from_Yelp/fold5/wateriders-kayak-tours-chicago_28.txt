Honestly one of the best times I've had. I've had to reschedule mutiple times and although Don said that the groupon is not redeemable after you cancel it, he was more about having us experience kayaking so he allowed it. I had a headache, and was not feeling well the entire day BUT STILL had an amazing time. Everyone in chicago has to try this stuff out. Chicago's scenery from the river view is unbelieveable. It was just nice to cruise and really enjoy the view. Also, the fellow boaters are real nice and always wave a friendly hello...so cute! Staff was really nice. I was nervous at first but Charlie reassured me that I was going to have a great time, and he was right, I did! They even provide refridgerated water bottles, and a waterproof case so you can take your phone and camera.. Absolutely loved this place, will go again!
