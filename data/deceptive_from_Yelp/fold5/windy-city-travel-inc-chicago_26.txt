I've been working with Windy City Travel for over 5 years now. I moved from St. Louis to Chicago and was in need of a new Travel Agent in the Chicagoland area.  After looking through the yellowpages and coming up with next to nothing, I stumbled upon Windy City Travel.  Marcie is my direct agent, though Gary has provided help when she is unavailable.  I have booked various trips throughout Europe and Mexico with Marcie and she listens to your needs/budget and makes planning the trip a cinch. She is dedicated to your travel plans and is very accurate and remembers all of the details. She also updates you if there are changes in your itinerary.  I've even recommended my brother, who lives in the St. Louis area, to use Windy City Travel for a trip and Marcie was able to help.  Windy City Travel has been great to work with and it is nice to have a personal go-to and expert for travel needs when necessary.
