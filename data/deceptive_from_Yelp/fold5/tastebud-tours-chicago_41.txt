I went on the loop tour in mid May when my girlfriend and I were in Chicago for the day.  We had heard of Tastebud Tours and thought we would give it a try.  As it worked out we had great weather and thoroughly enjoyed all the food stops and the sights and sounds that downtown Chicago has to offer.  Our tour guide's name was Lynn.  I thought he did a terrific job of providing us with all sorts of interesting facts about Chicago's great culinary history, as well as, enlightening us with other fun facts about some of the architecture we encountered along the tour route.   The time flew by and we were able to enjoy several of Chicago's specialties including deep dish pizza, a Chicago style hot dog (No Mustard!!), and a delicious brat from Berghoff's.  You will definitely finish the tour with a full stomach!  I would highly recommend this tour to anyone that is looking for a fun way to try some Chicago's culinary staples and and take in the sights and beauty that the Loop has to offer. Thank you Tastebuds for a very enjoyable day and I look forward to experiencing the Michigan Ave tour next time we can make it into the city!
