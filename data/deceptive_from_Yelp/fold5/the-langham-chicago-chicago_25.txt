I never wrote any reviews before, but after visiting the high tea at the Pavilion I want to describe my experience. It was terrible. We visited a couple high tea places before and we really liked it. So my daughter decided to celebrate her birthday at a new place. Well, it was big mistake. The service was terrible from the beginning to the end. The table was very uncomfortable and when we asked to move somewhere else, they said that they will do it when a new table will become available. But, they never did. The food was okay. Pretty much similar to other places we had, nothing spectacular. When I made the reservation I mentioned that my daughter will celebrate her birthday. However, they completely forgot about the birthday treat. When my daughter was away I reminded them. 10 minuets later they brought a cupcake and candle while my daughter was still not there. 15 minutes later, they brought it again. My daughter was very disappointed and upset with the whole experience. After that, we were ready to go so we wanted to get our coats back but there was no host around to ask about it. So we waited and waited and waited. Â Finally we asked the waiter and finally it was over.
