Went on one of the tours, and it was by far the most disgusting experience I've had the displeasure to have subjected myself to. I should have pulled out immediately, but I'm a cheap-skate and hated to lose the $...shame on me. On our tour, I encountered no fewer than 7 bloated, dead rats belly up in the sewage that was passing for the Chicago River. Mind you, I'm no wuss. I swim in the lake ALL THE TIME, but between the feces, branches, dead fish, and RATS, it was all I could do not to puke. I was afraid to drink from the bottle of water I'd brought as I feared the contamination from the river water (and I use the term lightly), splishing on EVERYTHING from the paddles. Really, the dept of health should intervene.
