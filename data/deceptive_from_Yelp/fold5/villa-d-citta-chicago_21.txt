My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon, June 2012 - our first stay at a B&B for both of us and wow were we pleased! Friendly staff, clean rooms, yummy breakfast daily and great area to explore! We never even went into downtown Chicago. We wandered through beautiful tree lined streets and gawked at the architecture of the homes. Tried some nearby restaurants/pubs. We walked to the zoo one afternoon and walked to Wrigleyville most every day - location was divine! The only downfalls were upon arrival we had no way to get into the locked gate and had to stand outside for 10 minutes calling for someone to let us in and the hot tub was not working at the time of our stay - things we were able to overlook in the grand scheme of our romantic stay. We have recommended this gem to many friends who are all eager to book a stay and we hope to return in the near future as well!
