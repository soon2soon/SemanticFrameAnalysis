I have been living in Chicago for over a year now and have never done a Kayak tour and I'm so glad I did. The tour was amazing and I would reccommend it to so many people. I did the Gangster tour at night and it was quite an experience. The two guides Seth and Adam were amazing and super helpful. They both did a great job explaining the kayaking process to newbies and the facts about the Gangsters was hilarious and fun. They only way I see someone giving this place a bad review is if they've never kayaked before. It is thrilling to be out on the river with big boats passing by and I can see if you're not used to it you might be nervous. What's great about Wateriders is it's a low key place that isn't giving you the run around like some of the bigger boat or kayak tours. This company is full of young river dogs who love showing the amazing side of Chicago to the tourists. Tourist or Local - GO!
