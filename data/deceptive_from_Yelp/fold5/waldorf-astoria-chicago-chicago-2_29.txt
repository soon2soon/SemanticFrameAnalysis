Perfection. My husband and I have stayed here for special occasions and loved it.  When my daughter became engaged last July, I recommended she consider holding her wedding at the Waldorf Astoria in January.  We met with with Ashley and after that the contract was signed and the planning began.  Ashley and Samantha were incredibly helpful and accommodating. Since the guest list was just over 30 people, the ceremony was held in the Ria Lounge and the reception was in the Hemingway Salon.  We, as well as our guests, were not disappointed.  The food, cocktails, staff and guest rooms were all superior.  Our guest rooms were ready for early check-in. We stayed in the Gold Coast Suite where some photos were taken and it was beautiful.  My daughter and her new husband were the happiest and that's what counts.  I cannot say enough good things about the Waldorf Astoria.
