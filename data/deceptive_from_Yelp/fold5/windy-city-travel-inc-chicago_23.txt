My husband and I used Windy City Travel to book our honeymoon to Italy. Kathy was amazing, she answered all of my questions in a thoughtful, professional and efficient manner. She searched for the best deals and was able to Â beat anything I had seen in my own searches. Kathy booked us airfare, hotels, tours and drivers in Rome, Florence and Venice and we could not have been more pleased. Our trip was perfect and stress free. Each hotel was perfect, clean, high rated and offered excellent service, every tour was well orchestrated and the logistics of travel between cities and within cities was very easy. We plan on using Kathy and Windy City for all of our travel needs from now on, and highly recommend them to anyone. Thank you Windy City and Kathy for giving us the most perfect stress-free relaxing honeymoon. We cant wait for our next excursion!
