I had a great time and would recommed this to my friends. This was my first time on a kayak and I felt that I got all the safety instructions I needed and the two guides in our quite large group (about 30) were very good about making sure everyone stayed together and everyone was doing ok paddling. They were professional, funny, gave us some interesting and new facts on Chicago and it was a good workout. It would be great if they had a sign on Kingsbury letting people know how to get to the store. If you park in the self park garage go all the way down and turn right once you exit the elevator.
