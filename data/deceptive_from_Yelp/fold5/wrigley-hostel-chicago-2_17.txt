I visited Chicago for 6 days I stayed at another hostel the first night but there was no availability at any other hostel for a Friday/Saturday. I came across this hostel on Hostelbookers. I couldn't find much information on it. I realized it was a brand new hostel. I booked my remaining 5 nights at Wrigley hostel. I stayed there from the second day it opened. It's owned by two fellow backpackers - Brian from Chicago and Brendan from Australia. LOCATION is excellent. It is half a block from the Addison train station that takes you to downtown. There are also buses nearby. The hostel is located half a block from the baseball stadium Wrigley Field. There are numerous bars, restaurants and food stores all in close proximity. You will not hear the train from the hostel as a row of homes across the street create a sound barrier. SAFETY: The surrounding neighborhood is very safe even at night.  The front door is locked and you must be buzzed in to enter.   In the hostel, there are lockers.  Each room is locked and they give you a key. FACILITIES: The hostel consists of two floors in an apartment building. They have a kitchen with all new appliances. They serve a typical continental breakfast.  There is a TV room which also has 3 computers, a pool table and a bar.   The rooms are average size for the number of beds in them. The beds were fine. The bathroom connected to my room was a large modern bathroom. It was shared by 2 rooms or 11 people. All in all I had a great time staying at the Wrigley hostel. I would definitely stay there again. It's as good as any other hostel. It has more of a bed and breakfast type feel to it compared to the Chicago Getaway hostel which was a bit institutional. I have no complaints with the hostel but gave it a 4 star simply because they were still getting set up when I arrived. Otherwise it deserves a 5 star.
