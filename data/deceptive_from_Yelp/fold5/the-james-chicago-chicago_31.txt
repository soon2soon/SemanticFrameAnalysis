Do not becomes what pretends to be.... + Location was fantastic, from my point of view in the best area of the city. + Really Comfortable  Beds! Would prefer shower had glass enclosure, rather than curtain and small closet (in winter will be really scarce of capacity) -Poor attention as expected based on great attention by e-mail. Because it was a special occasion for us. -Not as clean as modern looking as I expected based on the pictures.  Poor value for money. Do not becomes what pretends to be. (low level of finishes, furniture and facilities) -The restaurant in the hotel, "Primehouse" too expensive and bad service (big basic mistakes) . Do not becomes what pretends to be. Would recommend this to consider it.
