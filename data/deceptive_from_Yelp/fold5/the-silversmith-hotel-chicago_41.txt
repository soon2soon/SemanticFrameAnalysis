My husband and I stayed one night on 3/13/15.  It may have been Friday the 13th, but there was nothing unlucky about our experience.  This was my second time to stay and the staff was just as friendly and helpful as the last time.  The rooms are spacious and beautiful and surprisingly quiet since it's right under the El.  We were asked when checking in how we felt about noise, and since we aren't fans, she put us on the 6th floor. I appreciated being asked.     Some reviewers mentioned a problem with the doors.  I didn't have any problems either time I stayed.  The location really is perfect for the things we like to do.      We would definitely stay here again!
