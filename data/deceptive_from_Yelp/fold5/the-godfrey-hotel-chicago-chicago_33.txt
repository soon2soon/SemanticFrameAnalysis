I upped them a star because we did get to move to a higher floor, I believe just for our last night.  And that night was great.  Just, for the love of all things holy, make sure you are on a high floor, or do not stay.  They should not book the 5th floor for regular guests.  It should be reserved for nightclub patrons who decide to stay the night.
