We went on the Blood, Guns and Valentine's day tour on 6/30/12. Our tour guide was great.  He kept things funny but very interesting.  (I can't remember his name... John maybe)  3 hrs flew by and I could have stayed for more.  I will add this tour line to our "must do in Chicago" yearly trips.  I can't wait to try the other tours!
