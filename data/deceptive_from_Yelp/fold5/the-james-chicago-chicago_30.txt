I am from Chicago, so I'm pretty familiar with the hotels & hotspots in The city.  This hotel is in a great location for visitors!  The staff is super friendly also. The hotel was a "hotspot" back 10 years ago when I was in my early 20's- great bar/club & was in "the scene" for a time.  I think the bar/club is gone now.   The room we stayed in was OK- not what I was expecting for the star level.  It was clean, but "blah" for the price.  I think there are way more nicer hotels in the city to stay at- like I said, this place was "cool" 10 years ago, but needs to vamp up its game now.  I just was not impressed.
