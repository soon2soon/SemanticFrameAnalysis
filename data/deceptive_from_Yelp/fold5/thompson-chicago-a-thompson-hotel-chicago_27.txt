Stayed for one night there on 3/22/14. The Thompson Chicago  is  a 4 star plus boutique hotel situated in the heart of rush street. The hotel staff was professional and friendly and the décor was very appealing. Unfortunately, our stay there was not pleasant as we were kept awake basically the whole night by loud noises coming across the bathroom. The hotel staff was called but  not sure what they found as the reason for the loud noise. The issue was  brought  to the management and after a couple e-mails, the director of operations provided us with a complimentary room to make up for that night.  We are pleased with the outcome and  feel that they are fully committed to customer service.  Their 4 plus star rating is well deserved.
