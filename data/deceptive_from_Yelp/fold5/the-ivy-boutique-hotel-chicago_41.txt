The Ivy aspires to be a small luxury hotel. It is like a shiny present that you open and find a pair of socks. They haven't quite gotten the idea that true luxury is in the small details and impeccable customer service. Pros: large rooms, location, funky decor Cons: inconsistent amenities and service (turndown and treat first night and ignored second), horrible breakfast (runny scrambled eggs and burned sausage), thin, tiny, scratchy towels, leaky shower head, noisy (thin walls), added fees / room rate at checkout. Staff are available sporadically. We go to Chicago for the weekend several times a year and unless there are done real changes will NOT be returning to the Ivy. Disappointing.
