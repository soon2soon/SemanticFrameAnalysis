Good airline! Different, fun and laid back but also professional. Love the tv's in every seat and all the features that come with it such as games, chatting with other seats, on demand tv, shopping and ordering your food. Leather seats are nice because seems easier to wipe down and clean than the cloth seats that would harbor more germs and dirt. You start your check in with lively music and friendly greeting from staff at the check in desk. The flight attendants (except for 1) were friendly and not uptight. Airfare prices are not bad considering the services they provide. One airline I would definitely like to fly on a regular basis.
