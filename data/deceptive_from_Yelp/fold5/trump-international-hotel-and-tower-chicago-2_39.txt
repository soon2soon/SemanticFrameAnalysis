Simply put - this is a fantastic hotel. I have to travel a lot for business, so my hotel experience is generally undifferentiated.  Check in, sleep, check out.  However, Trump Tower so wildly exceeded my expectations, I felt forced to write this review. Customer service at it's best, from start to finish.  The rooms are large, with great views of the city.  In my mind, the only comparable to this hotel is the best hotels in Vegas. On vacation, I expect a little extra comfort and service.  To get it on a random Tuesday is remarkable. I'm no fan of the Donald, which is the only drawback in my mind. But if all his hotel experiences are like this, I've been missing out.
