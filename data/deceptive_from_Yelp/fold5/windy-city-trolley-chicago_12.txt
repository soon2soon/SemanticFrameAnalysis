We used Windy City Trolley for our wedding party transportation and as a guest shuttle from the hotel to the reception, and everything was great! As the bride, it was as good as it gets when everything goes on time, and I had zero problems to worry about. Our driver Tom was very polite, ready for us to have fun, and even dressed the part in a suit! So glad Windy City Trolley was a part of our day!
