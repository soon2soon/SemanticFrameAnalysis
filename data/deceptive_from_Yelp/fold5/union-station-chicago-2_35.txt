Union Station could be alot worse . But I do agree they need better and more signs . I have had 2 differant folks aske me where is this ? Where is that ? I am just riding the rails too . Â The food court is nice gotta try the Gold Coast Dogs !! After three differant trips to Chicago by rail I still get a bit confused . Restrooms have always been neat and clean . Considering everything I give it 4 stars .
