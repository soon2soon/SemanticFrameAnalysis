For a Westin I'd say it is just a bit below average.  The foodservice and bar area are great however the rooms are in need of update (at least mine was).  However much I tried I could not get the room to cool down and when I left the AC went off on its own.  So, I'd spend the first few hours in bed sweating.  Pretty noisy as well starting at 6 am there is a mean little guy blowing a whistle for taxis that you can hear in your room.
