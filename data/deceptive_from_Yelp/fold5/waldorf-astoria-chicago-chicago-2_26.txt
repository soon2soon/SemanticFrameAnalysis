Watch yourself when you are out on a balcony.  Cigarette butts rain down.  Also beware of that towel that you are about to use on your face.  They are often laid out on balconies and used by guests as their dog's pee pads.  The "green" rooftop gardens are nothing more that giant ash trays with beverage containers and have even contained discarded socks and soiled undies thrown off of said balconies.  FYI, I have photos.
