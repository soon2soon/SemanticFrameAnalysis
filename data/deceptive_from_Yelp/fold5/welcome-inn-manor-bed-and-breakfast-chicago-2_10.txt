Staying at Welcome Inn was one of the BEST decisions I made during our stay in Chicago. It was 'home away from home'. Our room was comfortable, clean and 'homey', with large windows and beautiful furniture. This is not your 'cookie-cutter' hotel. It is a beautiful, renovated Victorian manor with large windows and beautiful foliage. Breakfast was plentiful and different everyday and absolutely delicious! It was during this time you had the opportunity to meet and talk with the other guests from all over the world, or from right next door. The Innkeepers, Mel and Angie made us feel right at home the moment we met. They are the epitome of the perfect host, making our stay stress free and comfortable. I felt sad to leave, but look forward to my next visit. This is one stop in Chicago you do NOT want to miss!
