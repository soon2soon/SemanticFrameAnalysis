Duty called me to Beirut (family) and fun beckoned me to Rome.  And why not do Rome if I was in that neck of the wood?  But how do I get it all taken care of without mix-up, without worry, and without breaking the bank?  I took a chance and called Gary at Windy City Travel as I had never had the need to use a travel agent before and it was a wonderful experience.  Gary and the other folks could not have been more helpful.  He suggested so many things that made the total trip more enjoyable. thank you to Gary and others for a great trip.
