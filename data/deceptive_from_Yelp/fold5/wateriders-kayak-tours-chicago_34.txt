I bought a Groupon that was valid Mon-Fri for a kayak tour. Then, when I went to book a tour, the times were only during the day. Had I known that you could only use the Groupon during the day on a weekday (when most people work), I would have never purchased this trip. The worst part about this entire experience was dealing with the owner (Don, I'm assuming). This guy was extremely inflexible with using my Groupon outside of the times of MON - FRI during the times of 10am and 2:30. I tried explaining to him that what I purchased was good for MON - FRI with no explanation of times. He didn't budge, and even went as far as telling me that I was "trying to rip him off" for trying using the Groupon on a Wednesday night during the fireworks display on Wednesday nights. He wouldn't budge, said that "Groupon was the one that took your money, not me." Basically, this gentleman had real concern for customer service and did not have any interest in helping me out in any sort of way. All I wanted to do was enjoy a serene paddle on the Chicago River, and what I instead got was a "conversation" with a confrontational guy who was offensive right from the moment that there was a clear miscommunication. I'm sure the actual experience would be enjoyable, but I would have no idea and have no interest in dealing with Wateriders again unless it involved me going down to this establishment and challenging the owner to some sort of duel that started with a slap in the face with a white glove.
