I love to be pampered and this day spa has it down to a science.  The relaxing feel of the spa permeates your being the moment you walk into the doors.  Peaceful, tranquil and all things relaxing. Gorgeous facility, accommodating staff, skilled therapists! If you go, give yourself a little extra time to enjoy the amenities. I enjoyed a facial  and lounged around the saunas, steam room and shower for a bit as well. I enjoyed the different aromatherapy oils that guests can blend for use in the showers, saunas and steam room. What a nice touch!
