Ken has been our Chicago pub crawl guide for two Â years now and he never fails to deliver. Great stories, great personality. We bring our own bus to Chicago from about an hour south of the city. He steps on and gets right to it. He knows we're a rowdy bunch and he keeps us entertained. Don't know what else to say except that you can't go wrong with Weird Chicago Tours. We'll be back again next year.
