Without any doubt, this is now Chicago's finest hotel.  Beyond it's striking accommodations and thoughtful attention to even the most discriminating tastes, the staff and service is unlike any hotel I've experienced.  If I could give it six stars, I would.  Will definitely return.  Langham, well done.  Very, very well done!
