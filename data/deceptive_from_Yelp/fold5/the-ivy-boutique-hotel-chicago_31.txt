Best hotel ever. I spent last weekend Â and it was amazing the deep soaking tub was about 4 feet deep and I can say hands down that the tub makes this intel 6 stars. The wood floors and the slippers were made out of felt, the Devore is modern and the service for evening cocktails at the bar was great. I had the room service for breakfast and it was delicious and only about 20 dollars. Stay at the ivy if you want to support a local company who do thing right
