I Was just at the Boat show in Chicago where I talked to the reps for TikiBoat Chicago and booked my second charter with them.  They gave me a discount since I was at the show.  They told me they added a second TikiBoat so they can accomodate even larger groups and that 2 boats can go out at the same time!!! Last summer I planned a family reunion ,my brothers and thier wives, and we wanted something unique to do.  Everyone likes going downtown, so I though I would see if we could get out on Lake Michigan, but we didn't want to do one of those big excursions like Wendella or Oddesey.  We walked by the TikiBoat tied up on our walk to Navy Pier at Monroe harbor and inquired about taking us out for the afternoon the next day.  Wow what a fun time we had.   We were able to bring our own beer and wine on board along with food.  They took us  out on the lake for 3 hours where we could plug in our own iPod and listen to music.  The double decker pontoon boat even has a slide you can slide down from the top and go swimming.  That was a big hit.  We all loved Captain Joey who was very knowlegable about sailing the lake andgrew up in Chicago and gave us some places to go for dinner that night. Overall a great experience, so I just booked a second trip with 4 other couples for an evening excursion-Can't wait!!
