Nice enough place, but poor service. Rooms are large and nice, but I had problems with virtually everything in the room. The bathroom lights are so dark it's almost impossible to use the mirrors. Spoke with another guest in the lobby who had the same complaint. Â The ceiling lights are behind where you stand when putting on your make up, so you literally stand in the dark. Make up mirror is also dark. Really odd problems. No outlets by night stand. You have to put your phone on the floor to charge and have in reach of the bed. No iron or ironing board in room and no in house fitness center. I was excited they had an arrangement with a gym in the area, but it closed at (working off memory) 5pm on the weekends? I came to Chicago to shop and like to work out around 6-8pm, pre dinner. Not giving up shopping to go blocks away at 3pm to work out. The showers have issues. I took two showers and neither was even warm, let alone hot. Water pressure was low, as well. This is a 5 star hotel. How'd this happen? Great location, nice, but small lobby, but no parking, which was a pain. Parking available in various lots around the area, though. 5 min walk. Not worth going back, frankly, considering the price I paid, things should have been better.
