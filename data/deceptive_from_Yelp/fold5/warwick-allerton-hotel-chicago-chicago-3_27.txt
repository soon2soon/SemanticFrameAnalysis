Awful rooms, they are small and stuffy. I start having allergies and the beds are uncomfortable. I have friends who have stayed here a lot too and they say the same thing about the rooms being stuffy and causing allergies. The desk clerks are complete jerks, they are snobs with everyone and it gets very old very quickly. The rooms are just so old and drab. Next!!!
