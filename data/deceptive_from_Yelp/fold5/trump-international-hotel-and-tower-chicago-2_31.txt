Aside from Mr. Trump's face on everything he could fit it on, this was an outstanding experience. The service alone was phenomenal. The complimentary town car drove me all the way to Michigan Avenue, and the diner staff was the most attentive and thoughtful I'd ever met. I like to think this is a sign of well-cared for employees. The room itself was wonderful, but I will mope that the (fake) fireplace wasn't in any kind of lounging-in-front-of-it position. It was definitely a memorable stay. I'd love to stay again.
