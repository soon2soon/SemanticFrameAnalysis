We were in town for the weekend scheduled the Weird Chicago tour.  Just like the other reviews said, a great chance to see the city and learn about the history.  The stops along the way made it a comfortable and an enjoyable experience.  Our tour guide was Sunshine.  She had a great personality and was very considerate of all of the needs of the guests.  She was very knowledgeable of the history and city of Chicago.  The driver did an excellent job as well!   We would recommend the tour.
