We went on the tour yesterday afternoon.  It was blistering HOT and a GREAT TIME!  The guide, Joel, was fantastic!  He had tons on knowledge and great, interesting stories about Chicago history--lots of unknown facts interesting architectural information too.  It was a great tour.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to get a different look at our great city.   A+  Very entertaining and lots of fun.  This is a MUST DO ACTIVITY!  You won't be disappointed.
