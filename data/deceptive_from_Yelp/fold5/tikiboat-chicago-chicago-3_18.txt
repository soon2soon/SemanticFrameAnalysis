This was seriously the most fun thing our group of friends have done all summer!  The captain and his crew made the trip so much fun- not to mention that the boat is amazing!  The slide from the upper deck, the music and the way to the boat was decorated made the day!  We would recommend this boat for any group of people who are looking to have a blast on lake Michigan!
