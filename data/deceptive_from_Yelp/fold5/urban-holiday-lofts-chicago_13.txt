Stayed at Holiday Jones and Urban Holiday on 2 separate nights. Both cool! Holiday jones is a little cozy for me being 6'5" but a nice quiet place to sleep and hang out in Wicker park. Urban Holiday has a much better common area,sunny windows and a decent view of downtown though not as quiet as HJ Â kitchens on each floor and both have free breakfast.
