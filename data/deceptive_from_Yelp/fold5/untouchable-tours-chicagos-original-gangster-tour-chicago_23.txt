My daughter and I had pretty much explored all of Chicago when she came across a brochure for the Untouchables Tour. We booked it and are glad we did. It was sold out so we would not have been able to  just walk on. Johnny "Rocco" and Johnny "Three Knives" were our historians for the very informative 1 1/2 hour return to yesteryear.  It is apparent they love their jobs and have spent a considerable amount of time researching the era. Our only negative comment does not pertain to the tour but to the city of Chicago for tearing down some of the historic landmarks that were so much a part of what formed the city.  We would definitely recommend this tour.
