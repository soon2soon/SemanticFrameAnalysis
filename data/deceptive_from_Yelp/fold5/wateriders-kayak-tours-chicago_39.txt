I agree with Sarah U. in saying that their customer service is very subpar, lacking any positive vibes. The owner is extremely unpleasant, and I am yet to speak with anyone else on the phone who isn't. Long story short: I got 2 youswoops last year. I called in advance, and the next 5 weekends were booked, so we ended up getting scheduled on the last trip of the season. Well, it got cancelled due to weather, and they tried to tell me I couldn't use it next season, but they reluctantly said I could. Again, the employees, particularly the owner is just rude. He even got lippy with me on the phone because in the time that it took their online reservation service to take my request for a tour I had made other plans and I didn't see the email (since they didn't call to confirm) and I rejected the email confirmation of the tours a couple days later, see excerpt from email: \\We try to respond as quickly as possible - I'm not sure that from 8:59am to 2:23pm is that out of the ordinary. Â Indeed, if you had made plans within that timeframe, 5 hours and 24 minutes, it seems hardly fair that you respond 57 hours and 8 minutes later, with another 8 hours delayed beyond that for us to retrieve your email due to the time you sent it. We regret to inform you that the 11:31pm timestamp on the 2nd, and subsequent receipt of your email the following morning, is under the 48 hour notice we require for cancellation of reservations, so technically we are entitled to hold you accountable to our policy and must consider you a no-show for 2 people for the event, having redeemed your coupon in the process for the spots.// Anyway, all I wanted was my money back for the youswoops because I want nothing to do with them, and he refused. Judging by other people's stories of how not-so-great they are, I must've made a good decision by just getting partial refund from youswoop and just forgetting about them. Very shrewed business practices.
