I've stayed at a great many hotels in Chicago on business and pleasure and I loved the IVY.  The staff was amazing...it rained the first day and they gave us umbrellas and the doorman with the umbrellas walked us to the corner to show us our way.  The room with the sitting area proved very nice for our twosome.  And the bathroom was outstanding...the marble rainshower was fabulous.  I wish I could put 4.5 because of the view of another building from our sitting area, but what do you expect in a boutique hotel downtown...
