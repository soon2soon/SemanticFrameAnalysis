The only thing good about this hotel is that the location is perfect for the conference I was attending.  The first thing I noticed when I arrived at the Allerton Hotel was that it looked like a college dorm apartment.  It was difficult to find the front desk reception area since it was up several levels.  But once I found it, it was rather uninviting as was the lobby bar.  The food at the lobby bar was not so good, but still had a high price tag.  I only stayed at this hotel since my conference was right across the street and it had already filled up.  The view from my room was outstanding which is why I'm giving 2 stars, but the room itself was very small and cold.  If the price was significantly lower than the neighboring hotels, I might stay there again, but it seemed to be in the same price range so I would look elsewhere for a nicer room.
