This review is 6 months overdue, but better late than never! My mom was flying from Dallas to ORD to visit a friend in Elk Grove. She was panicked as her friend was unable to pick her up from the airport. So, I decided to treat her to a car service. Since I live in Dallas, I had to rely on the ole reviews from the Internet. Apparently, there are a lot of crappy car services in Chicago! All I could find were terrible reviews and rude people. Then I stumbled upon the Top Fleet website. Ahhh, finally some class.  I called and spoke to Ryan, who was awesome!  He made me feel comfortable immediately. He was courteous and professional.  Oh, added bonus, rates were completely reasonable. After I made the reservation, I ended up calling Ryan many times with annoying questions, and he was always patient and understanding. I wanted to make sure I didn't lose my mom at O'Hare, so I arranged for a "meet and greet" in the airport.  The driver was there to meet my mom, just as planned. My mom was completely floored with the Top Fleet service. She just raved and raved about the driver and the service itself.  The driver made her feel so comfortable, I think she tried to sit in the front seat with him. She clearly isn't familiar with a car service. Anyway, she told all her friends, and talked about the experience forEVER. I think the Top Fleet transfer was the highlight of her trip. You'd think I flew her in a private jet to Paris with Tom Hanks as the pilot. So, I didn't lose my mother and I gained an excellent car service. I would recommend Top Fleet to anyone.
