MUST SEE!! Whether you are from Chicago or in town visiting this is definitely something you NEED to do while in the city. Not only was the tour guide so friendly but he knew so much about the history and told great stories of how the Cubs came to be. I was so happy with how much we got to see in the stadium, locker room, press box, clubhouse and we even got to go out on the field and take pictures!! The price is a deal as well..$25 for a little over an hour and you get to see so much you never see during game days! Great job!! GO CUBS!!
