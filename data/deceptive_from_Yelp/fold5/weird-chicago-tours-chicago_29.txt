We take the ghost tour in every city we visit.  This is one of the best.  We took the "Weird and Haunted Tour".  The stories are historical, captivating, and wickedly weird.  Our tour guide was Clarence and the driver was Greg--they made it even more memorable.  This tour is definitely worth every penny.  Cheers!
