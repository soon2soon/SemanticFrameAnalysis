When I first stepped in to the Villa a sensation came over me unlike any I ever imagined or experienced at any B&B or private Hotel here in the states. In my studies I traveled abroad and it s just that privately owned and operated European charm I'm speaking of. I was promptly greeted by the house keeper who helped me with my bags to the elevator as I checked in to the Venetian Suite. My stay was only to be 2 days as I visited Chicago during the a research seminar. I had my own private walkway to the Jacuzzi n lounging chair just outside of my room where I cuddled up in the cozy bathrobe while finishing off a long day a dip in the spa n my favorite vine. I'm now nestled up in my flat in West Village, Manhattan and seem to have brought the peacefulness I experienced at the Villa home. I can't leave out how sweet Ralph the host (Innkeeper) was from the time he booked my reservation until he arranged my transportation back to the Airport.
