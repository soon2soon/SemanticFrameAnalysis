If I was tourist I would absolutely recommend this tour! It has a guide who explains all the architecture of Chicago. It was very useful to understand the history of the architecture. I loved the last part when we were on the lake and you could see the beautiful night view. Ah! Don't forget to bring a jacket! It was pretty cold.
