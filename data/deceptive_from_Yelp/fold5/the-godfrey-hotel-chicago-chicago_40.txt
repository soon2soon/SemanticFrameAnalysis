Lovely hotel with clean spacious rooms and all the amenities needed for a Â more than comfortable stay. The IO Rooftop Lounge is definitely a must experience when visiting Chicago. More importantly the staff, is exceptionally approachable, friendly, and beyond helpful. Stavros and Cruz were amazing and helped make my friends birthday weekend exceed our expectations! Belinda B
