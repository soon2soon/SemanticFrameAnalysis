As some who read Yelp may know, the electric bike market is expanding at a good pace in certain parts of the country.  I had been looking for an electric bike store which was not too far west or Downtown where I could have my electric bike repaired.  I came across this company, Wanderbikes, and they gave me great service, even on Labor Day, when I needed my bike fixed. They rent bikes, they repair them and they sell them and they do an excellent job!  I would give them a 5-Star rating and recommend that anybody who is interested in electric bikes visit their shop at 2350 N. Damen, Chicago, just south of Fullerton.  These three brothers are a pleasure to deal with and I truly applaud what they are doing in the electric bike sector which is underserved in Chicago compared to other markets such as California, Florida, etc. Jim D.
