Lately, I have used Travisa Outsourcing Services for OCI Processing of my family. Priro to th to the filing, I had no clue of the process. I went through their web site and learned A to Z about the process and started the application on my own. Starting from the Online Application to the OCI card was received (30 Calendar Days), the process had been so prompt. The real time tracking of the application & Email/SMS notification are the best part of the whole proocess. I still remember the old days in waiting in the long queues at the consulate and getting frustrated with the phone calls made to consulate staff. Life has become so much easier with Travisa Outsourcing.
