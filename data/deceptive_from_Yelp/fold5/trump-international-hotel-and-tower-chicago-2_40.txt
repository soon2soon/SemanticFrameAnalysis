I splurged for my XXth birthday and spent the memorial day weekend there.. What a great room... Even though I did not use a lot of the amenities it was a great place... The room is set up like a apartment with its own range, dish washer etc... Love the TV in the bathroom mirror... But it should be across from the toilet or in the shower... The Wi-Fi was the best I ever had in an hotel. I will be back!!!
