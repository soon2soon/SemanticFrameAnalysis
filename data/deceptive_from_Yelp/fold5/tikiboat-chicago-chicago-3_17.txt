I have never written a Yelp review before, but after this outing, I wanted to do something for these guys to show how much I really appreciated everything they did. What an amazing trip! I don't know why someone didn't come up with this idea a long time ago. Having lived in Chicago as one of the "boat-less" masses for most of my life, I recently discovered and booked a trip with my friends aboard the TikiBoat. What can I say? EVERYONE should experience this. First off, the boat is incredible. Water slide, TONS of room, CLEAN bathroom (which my girlfriend was pleasantly surprised to find) and the friendliest staff I think I have ever encountered in any business. While I'm sure it would be tempting for anyone working in this type of business to take their job lightly, our captain and his crew-member were absolute professionals and catered to us far better than anyone else ever has. What makes these guys the best is that they are not just professional, but fun because they clearly enjoy their jobs. These guys know the lake and know where the places to "see and be seen" are. The Play Pen (I think that's what it was called) was a blast and I always wondered what it would be like to be out there amongst all those fun people on those gorgeous boats!!!!! We felt like rock stars all day! If you haven't checked these guys out yet........you need to do it. We are already planning our next outing before the season ends. Captain Joey......you are the best. Thank you and like I said, we will see you soon! -The "Margaritaville" Crew- P.S. Sorry we requested that song so many times, but it just felt right to hear Jimmy aboard your boat. Thanks for being so accomodating.
