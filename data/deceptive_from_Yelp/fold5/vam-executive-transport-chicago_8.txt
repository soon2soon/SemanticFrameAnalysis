I was left high and dry by another limo company that decided to cancel my reservation the day before it was supposed to take place  so I called VAM at the last possible second to set up a ride and it was no problem!  Friendly driver and very accommodating company.  They were even a few minutes early picking us up.  This is now the first place I will go when booking a limo.  Great service!
