My first visit to the Trump Tower was for a family Christmas party, held on the 64th floor. From the personnel who greeted us in the foyer, to the sweeping city views from the condo, and to the exquisite cuisine prepared by Trump staff, we were remarkably impressed. The major thrill of our evening was the gathering of family, but that building and it's staff were memorable as well. They provided an almost Dubai - like setting (less the Vegas garishness), and displayed a level of respect for visitors that would make "The Donald" proud.
