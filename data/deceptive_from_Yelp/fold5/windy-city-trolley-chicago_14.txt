We had two Windy City Trolleys for our wedding in May, 2011, and I could not have been happier with them.  Both of the trolleys were clean and on time to take all of our guests and wedding party from the hotel to the church and back to the hotel.  All of our out of town guests loved riding in the trolleys and having great views of the city of Chicago!  The wedding trolley was equipped with music and drinks and a lot of smiles and laughter.  Our driver made all the photo stops and still got us back safe and on time for the reception.  It was truly a pleasure working with Windy City Trolley. Thank you for EVERYTHING !
