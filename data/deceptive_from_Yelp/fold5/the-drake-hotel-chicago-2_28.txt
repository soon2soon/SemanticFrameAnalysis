The Drake in Chicago is absolutely beautiful. It is everything a hotel should be. Friendly staff, elegant d√©cor, comfortable rooms. My time there was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in a great, classy hotel in Chicago. A BIG thanks goes out to everyone there! Me and my wife appreciate the amazing service.
