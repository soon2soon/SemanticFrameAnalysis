We went on this tour in July 2011. I went with one other friend. She is a meat eater and I am a vegetarian. We were both SO happy with all the food offered on the tour. As a vegetarian I thought that at some stops I would just not be given food - however, they either has the food available without meat or I got a completely different food sample! It was SO wonderful. My friend who is a meat eater LOVED all of her food as well. The tour guide was so friendly and answered all of our questions! I would recommend this tour to anyone looking to see Chicago in a different way. There were even some individuals from Chicago on our tour who seemed to love it as well!
