Everything was great! It was my 40th birthday celebration so we decided to take a goup of 9 of us out driving around Chicago with lots of wine and champagne. The limo was new and the driver John was lovely! On time, and he put up with our loud music and loudness in general with a smile. A very easy process and I will definitely be using again. Thanks!
