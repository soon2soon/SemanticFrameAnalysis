I liked my stay here. My boyfriend and I purchased a groupon for our stay that included complimentary valet parking, breakfast for two and room. The service was excellent. Everyone were very helpful across the board. The only cons of our stay was that the room we had was very loud throughout the night because of the electric/heat box. It was absolutely horrible. I couldn't sleep throughout the night. However, for the price we paid and what came with it, that would be the only complaint I have of our room. The service for their Italian restaurant next door is not that great. So don't expect to be served quickly or be checked on. We went there for their Valentine's special and hardly anyone was in the restaurant. The waiter was attentive as required but the wait for food was exceptionally long for being one of the only ones there. That being said, the food was exceptional. So take it or leave it. Service for breakfast was even more horrible. It was so busy, and none of the waiters were attentive at all, save for serving. Our drinks were never refilled. However, the food was excellent again. Delicious egg benedicts. Would I stay here again? Maybe if I just wanted to shop since it's right next to Michigan Avenue. Otherwise I wouldn't mind paying more for a more comfortable place.
