New hotel over sells itself. Minibar was a sink and faucet. Thought there would a stocked bar and fridge. Luxury super comfortable chair turned out to be a desk chair. Plenty of space for a lounge chair in which to watch TV but none there. No glasses in the bathroom. Room keys failed over and over requiring a trip to front desk for reprogramming. Food in bar was underwhelming. French fries limp and tasteless.  Hard to eat on a couch and cocktail table. Breakfast service good but few customers. Lots of potential but much to work out for this new hotel-restaurant.  Neat decor and very comfortable bed
