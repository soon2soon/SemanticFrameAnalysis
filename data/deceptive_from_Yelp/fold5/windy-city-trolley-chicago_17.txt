We had a great experience with Windy City Trolley.  We used them for our wedding last December and found the service fantastic.  They went above and behind with exceptional service.  We had a snowy winter wedding and the driver greeted all my bridemaid's and  made sure they made it safely from our house to the trolley than again off the trolley and into the church.  I would recommend this Trolley service to anyone who is in need of arranging transportation for a large group of people!
