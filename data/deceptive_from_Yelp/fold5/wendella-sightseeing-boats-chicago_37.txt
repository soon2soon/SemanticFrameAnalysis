My wife and I took the Wendella architectural and Lake tour on the afternoon of 06/29/13. This was a great tour. We posed for a pre-boarding photo, the vessel arrived on time and loading was prompt and convenient. After a quick and comprehensive review of safety regulations we were off. The river portion of the tour was very interesting with a very professional tour guide highlighting the various types of architecture visible from the river and sharing interesting anecdotes about the history of these buildings. The views were awesome. Then it was on to the lock system that connects the river to the lake and out onto the lake. This was my favorite part of the tour. The views of the city were mind boggling. It was absolutely breathtaking. The lower portion of the vessel is enclosed with a small bar and concession. You can get drinks or a warm refreshment like coffee or cocoa. I'd recommend you bring a windbreaker because even on a warm day it can be a bit chilly on the lake. On your return you can purchase the pre boarding photo (it's a package of several different sizes) which we did. The photo quality was outstanding and for $20 we have a special memory already framed and on display in our home. A great tour for less than $30 and I highly recommend the professional and courteous staff at Wendella Sightseeing Boats. Would do it again the next time we were Â in the city.
