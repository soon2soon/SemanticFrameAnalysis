I am so disappointed with my stay at the langham hotel in Chicago while I stayed here 8/27 to 8/30. I have stayed in a variety of hotels downtown Chicago and this specific hotel made me feel the most uncomfortable and unwelcome. Every time I walked inside, I was asked by at least 3 employees of I had a room here and wouldn't let my sister in because they said, and I quote, "if you don't have a copy of the key then we cannot let you come in."I found that absolutely ridiculous. I understand that they were trying to keep everything in order but we are PAYING guests and felt like we had no freedom. Another incident we encountered was in places like the gym, spa, and pool. My mother was not allowed into the pool area because she was not wearing the appropriate clothing to go swimming. They turned her away while she was trying to accompany her other 11 year old daughter who wanted to go swimming. Â Whenever I went outside for a smoke, I was told not to stand in front of the hotel and to stand behind over a hundred girls behind a police barrier. Overall I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome in this hotel I don't think I would ever stay here again.
