this the nicest hotel i have ever seen. I would love to stay there for a week but it is so expensive. The pool is nice. The rooms are heaven. you have a tv in the bathtub and you can watch it. You can relax in a nice hot jacuzie watching your favorite tv show. Also they have a really big tv you can watch when ur laying in bed. The beds are really comfterable to sleep in.
