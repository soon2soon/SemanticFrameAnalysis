I stayed at the wit for my best friends wedding. I have been helping her as much as I could, to plan the wedding she has been waiting for so long. This hotel is very expensive and THEY CHARGE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING! 2 weeks before the big day, they told her some bogus excuses for why they were not going to host the party she has been planning for the past 8 months. You can see her review for more details. We were all very disappointed about how management handled the entire situation. She was a beautiful bride and seeing her get married was amazing, but Chicago is full of beautiful hotels that have much better service. DONT HAVE YOUR EVENT HERE.
