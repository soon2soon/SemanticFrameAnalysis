I have to say that seeing a tour of Chicago from the river kind of gives you a new perspective on this city. We went on a beautiful day in the spring (back when we thought summer was here in late March) and we took the architecture tour of the river. (Apparently you couldn't go out on to the lake yet). The only complaint I had was that it was a tad expensive ($25 for 75 minutes), but other than that everything was great. The tour guide gives just the right amount of information without being overbearing, I learned some new things - Merchandise Mart has its own zip code? Â There definitely some breaks in the tour to just enjoy the sites, take pictures and relax. There is a bar on board and the prices are fairly standard - $5 for a beer, $1 for snacks. The boat was also huge, I felt like I could walk around as much as I wanted and get any view I wanted. Really enjoyed this experience.
