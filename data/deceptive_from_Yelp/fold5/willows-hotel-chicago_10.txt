I used to live a block away and never knew this place was here. Pleasantly surprised, it's a very nice independent hotel. Four stories,older building but very nicely done and feels more modern than it is. I'm in a tasteful double with lots of room and everything about it feels like Chicago, I miss all the older buildings with radiators and tiled bathrooms and some character. I got the roomlinx upgrade, don't know if this is the case for all rooms but there's snacks and sodas and even cheap wines at the ready. I would say if you don't like your room for some reason, upgrade. Very comfy bed. The staff are pretty awesome, you'll see a bio card telling you where the desk clerks from, maybe a note telling you that Danielle from Bulgaria serviced your room. Very international and eclectic team here, and I just don't see other hotels going out of their way to introduce their staff to you that way. Parking is $20 or $22 a night with in and out privileges. Now for the bad: they refused a USPS priority mail envelope for me with a rental check that was guaranteed delivery for Friday. Totally causing me a week or longer delay because the sender still hasn't received it a week later. Who does that? Would have been a 5-star review. No ones ever given me problems with mail or packages while I'm a guest. Oh well.
