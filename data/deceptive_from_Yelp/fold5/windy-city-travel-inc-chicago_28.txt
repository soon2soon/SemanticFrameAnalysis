I've been working with Marcie from windy city travel for a couple years.  My first trip was to Jamaica and it was amazing...it was a short trip that we gave her a budget for and she made it amazing!  We were upgraded last minute and it turned into the trip of our dreams.  She knew what beach/hotel/time of year to go to Jamaica and made it awesome.  The second trip we had was to Prague and she knew the perfect place to stay for a good price, she also booked some amazing tours for us to places all around.  Then in the fall we booked a cruise through her and once again were last minute upgraded!  She's an angel!!!  The Mediterranean cruise was amazing and she worked with our budget perfectly.   I'm about to go to Portugal and once again she stayed within my budget and got us great places to stay, she is very knowledgeable and makes traveling hassle free.  I was just in there last week and she planned an amazing trip to Peru.  I'm going by myself and was nervous but she calmed my nerves and got me a great group tour and I can't wait to go on my adventure.  She is always nice and professional.  Marice gets down to business with the airlines and hotels, she always works hard and gets the best price possible!  Your in great hands if you go to windy city travel and work with Marcie!
