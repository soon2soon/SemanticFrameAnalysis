We went on the Taste Bud Tour Taste of Chicago for a family reunion (which also included a toddler in a stroller).  Anna Lyn was not only extremely knowledgeable and friendly, but she was also very considerate and accommodating to our needs with a stroller.  Lynn, the owner, would pop in and out of the the tour to make sure everything was okay.  Overall, a good way to get some good eats and see part of Chicago.
