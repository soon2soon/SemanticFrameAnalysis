My boyfriend and I stayed at the Willow's Hotel last weekend while we were in town for a concert. The staff was friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. The room was small but still had enough room for just the two of us. It was more than I expected. The breakfast was great! Cereal, coffee, bagels, english muffins, regular muffins, hard boiled eggs... I loved it! The hotel was also located in an awesome location. Literally seconds away from shopping, dining and many attractions! The only downside was the parking. We paid $17 to park for 24 hours. Not too bad, but another expense. All in all it was a great experience!
