I went on my first Road Less Traveled trip in 1998 and have been a huge fan of RLT since then. I still get excited to receive their colorful brochure in the mail each year! In fact, I just received it 2 weeks ago and read it cover to cover right away. Â Even my parents still request the brochure, because it brings back all of our fond memories. The 2 trips that I went on, Ridges & Rapids and Water & Rocks, are both still offered today. I would highly recommend them to any kids who are looking for a fun, eye opening and life changing experience. RLT has a pristine reputation for hiring and training the best leaders in the world and creating experiences that will change your view of the world.
