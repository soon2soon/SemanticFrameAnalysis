We just returned from a trip to Chicago and stayed at the Thompson. The service, rooms and food were fantastic. We were provided a number of great recommendations on places to eat and things to do by Larkin MacDonald and Cheryl Rule. They could not have been more helpful. Cheryl even came in early one day to help us with transportation for golf. Â I strongly recommend staying here. The hotel is in a great part of Chicago and there is a ton to do within walking distance. The manager, Steve Shern greeted us and made sure everything was perfect. I will never stay anywhere but the Thompson on trips to Chicago.
