A big thanks to Ryan at Top Fleet!!  We used Top Fleet several weeks ago for our son's wedding rehearsal.  Everyone at Top Fleet that we had contact with, was helpful, friendly and professional.  We hired a small bus to transport guests from the rehearsal to the rehearsal dinner and back to the hotel.  The driver was prompt and exactly where he was supposed to be.  The bus appeared to be quite new and was clean and comfortable. Their pricing is reasonable and the price we were quoted was exactly the price we were charged. Thanks for helping us get our guests safely to and from!  Everyone was so relaxed!  It helped add to the party atmosphere! We will definitely use Top Fleet again and will HIGHLY recommend it to everyone!
