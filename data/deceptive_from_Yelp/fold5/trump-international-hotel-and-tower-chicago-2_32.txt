Wow wow wow, I was lucky enough to be invited to an event in the ballroom or banquet room and it was unbelievable.  The staff was exactly what you would expect and everything was on point.  The level of service and quality of the food was breathtaking.  The manger on the floor was a young man who made sure everything was in order for us the entire night.  Just a perfect night.
