If you are looking to get verbally abused by security and told that not only was your business not important, but that you would be evicted this is the place for you then. We through my best friend a bachelorette party saturday night and booked a suite and conjoining room as to not disturb the guests. We purposely made the hotel portion of the night from 4pm -8pm, and prior to booking even discussed with a party planner having the party there and that there would be no noise after 10pm We only had 8 girls in the suite. And at 5:30pm got a knock on the door to keep everything down that there were complaints. No big deal. With in 30 minutes later they came again and told us next time he comes we would be evicted from the hotel. When we explained we work for one of their largest partners and not only consistantly book company events there but put our own clients up at guests. We were told that other people drop over $100,000 there and that our business was not important. We complained and were told we would be contacted by a manager. 3 days later an email came from Jerrod Cipiak the hotel coordinator, that quote stated if we wanted to party go to the roof. Not only did they nearly ruin my best friends night but continue to be condecending and rude in handling this. You not only berrated your guests now, but lost very important clients, hope it was worth it.
