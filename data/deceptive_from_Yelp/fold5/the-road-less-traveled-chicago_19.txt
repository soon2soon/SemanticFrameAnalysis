My trip to Tanzania with RLT was quite literally the trip of a lifetime. I was beyond nervous to travel without my family to Africa, but it turned out to be one of the most defining experiences of my childhood. I spent a month in a Masaai village with 2 incredible leaders and a group of 8 other kids building a school for the community. The cultural immersion RLT provided was unbelievable. It was evident to me that The Road Less Traveled spends a lot of time and effort organizing these trips-the safari at the end of the trip was nothing short of amazing. My 2 leaders were exceptional people, that I still keep in touch with today. This was definitely a challenging experience, but one that I will be forever grateful for.
