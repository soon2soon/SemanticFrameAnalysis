Anyone reading above review, please note: that must have been misunderstanding-----that Two brothers, chris and niko,  do not HAVE a tikiboat..... they are  Captain Nick (Niko) & first mate: chris.... who were hired by the renter for their excursion..... I am the owner of the TikiBoat,  Paul Newman.... and it is a fun deal to rent (pick your own captain from a list I have or any other captain.... ) for your own private party (bday, office, wedding, anniversary, graduation, etc. or just ordinary tuesday afternoon... or just take a tikiboat ride;  can call me direct: 708 288-9366 cell or  join as a 'friend' on facebook.... just search   'tikiboat'   one word...... !!
