We recently rented the tiki boat to celebrate a friend's upcoming marriage.  We had a fantastic time!  Paul, the owner, seems genuinely interested in making sure you enjoy your time on the boat.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, you can bring your own food and drinks on board.  There are coolers on board and plenty of space for food and other things.  The slide off the back is a great addition to the boat and a lot of fun. You do need to secure your own captain for the boat.  Paul provides you with captain recommendations.  While we initially had some difficulty connecting with a captain, we did end up going with Ray, who is on the recommended captain list.  Ray was a fantastic sport with our bachelorette shenanigans and was a ton of fun.   The view of the city is amazing from the tiki boat.  I highly recommend both the tiki boat and Ray.  We are already planning our trip for next summer.
