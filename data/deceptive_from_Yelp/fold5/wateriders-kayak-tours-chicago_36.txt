I have been very disappointed with the service that Waterriders offers.  I bought a groupon for 6 people and tried to schedule twice.  Both times were cancelled, with the first night, July 13, 2012, with the rain stopping at 3PM and it turned out to be a beautiful evening by 5 PM.  We also scheduled a night at a hotel downtown for this occasion as we thought we would stay in the city and enjoy the night.  We were unable to cancel the hotel stay, so we stayed anyway.  Then we rescheduled for 09/21/12 and again it was cancelled due to weather.  This night was bad weather. I contacted Waterriders to see if they would honor the groupon next year.  They said yes, but ONLY FOR 4 people and that there was still plenty of time in October to go on the tour.  I replied to them, telling them it was unfair for our groupon to not be honored for the 6 people because that is what we purchased and it was them who cancelled, not us.  We had all 6 of us taken half days off of work twice to be there and they cancelled both times.  I explained that we need at least one month to plan for 6 people to clear a schedule since we are all parents with little kids, we all have kids that play sports, we all work, and it we would not like to be in the water in CHICAGO in October when it is cold outside.  They never replied.  So I contacted Groupon and explained my situation and they issued a refund.  I was VERY disappointed with the service because I explained all of the measures that we had taken to make an appt and they never replied.  I will never try to schedule with them again and I will make sure to spread the word about how terrible my experience was.
