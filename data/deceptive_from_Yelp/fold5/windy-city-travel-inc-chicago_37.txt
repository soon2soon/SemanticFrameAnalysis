We first visited Windy City Travel and Gary Trick on a recommendation from a family member and have never regreted that decision.  Gary helped us plan our trip to Italy and it was a trip of a life time.  We could not have asked for better service.  Since our trip to Italy Gary has helped us with travel arrangements to Mexico, Hawaii and the Caribbean.  He is very knowledgeable about the places we were visiting and gave us great tips.  What I really appreciate from Gary is his attention to my specific travel plans as he is always available to answer any questions or concerns we may have.  With our trip to Mexico we simply told him the dates we wanted to travel and how much we wanted to spend and he provided us with an awesome trip.  Windy City Travel and Gary Trick ARE as good as it gets and I wouldn't think of going to anyone else for our  travel needs.  THANKS Gary for doing what you do and doing it well.
