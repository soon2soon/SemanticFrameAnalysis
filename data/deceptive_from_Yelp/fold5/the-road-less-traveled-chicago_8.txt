The Road Less Traveled is the very best program of its kind in the world. It offers teens the chance to discover themselves through a program of travel, discovery, service, adventure and leadership. I am the book author of "The Sacred Flight of the Teenager: A Parent's Guide to Stepping Back and Letting Go". Â I believe that teens must get connected to their core -- their authentic self -- and make decisions from that place. As parents, teachers and teen program coordinators, we can help by offering assistance during a teen's turning points and passages. The Road Less Traveled accomplishes this "task" to a point of perfection! Don't miss out by not sending your teens on one of their excellent programs. It will change their lives, and yours too. The directors, Jim and Donna Stein, do all the right things. Their teachers and course leaders are the finest you can find anywhere. Our two older sons participated in three of their adventure trips. They each had phenomenal experiences filled with fun, learning, personal discovery, growth and decision-making.
