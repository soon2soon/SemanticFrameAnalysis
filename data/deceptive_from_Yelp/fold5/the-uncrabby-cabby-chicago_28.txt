Reliable and friendly. I used them to get to the airport from Loyola's Lakeshore campus. They were a bit late, but made sure to call and let me know, and were very apologetic. I spoke directly with the driver who told me exactly where he was (turned out a light was out where he had to make a left, not his fault at all). Friendly during the long ride, just overall a great service. Flat rate is comparable to what I would pay a cab, maybe a couple bucks more but worth the (much) better experience. They are only a year old but are expanding quickly because their service is by far the best deal in Chicago.
