I was over in Chicago for work but I was staying outside the city so I decided to take the weekend and stay in the center to do all the touristy things. All the hotels I found were way over priced and quite far out so by chance I came across the Wrigley Hostel. The hostel wasn't opened at this stage so I rang them and they told me they should be open for the dates I was due to arrive. Turns out though they could have used that extra time but because they had taken my booking the owners worked extra hard and got the hostel open only the day before I arrived. On arrival I was told that the has specifically opened the hostel to accommodate my booking and not let me down. That is how incredible and accommodating the owners here are. The hostel is in a great location, easily accessible to the airport and a minutes walk to the CTA train which goes into the loop in just 15 minutes. The hostel is also close to the Wrigley Stadium which when there is a game on the whole area is buzzing. The nightlife in this area is great also with a number of bars and restaurants to chose from. Its also quite a safe area. The hostel has a great common room with a large TV, a bar area, computers, a pool table and a huge couch. You can bring in your own alcohol and meet new people quite easily here. The hostel is quite secure also and even though it is in a busy area there is no street noise. As the hostel is newly opened it is really clean. The bedrooms are spacious and the beds are really comfortable plus you have a choice of a dorm or a private room. They also offer free breakfast and there is outdoor decking where they hold barbecues or you can just sit out and enjoy the sun. As I already mentioned the owners are extremely accommodating and they have great knowledge of the city and are always ready to help. I really would recommend this hostel and this city.
