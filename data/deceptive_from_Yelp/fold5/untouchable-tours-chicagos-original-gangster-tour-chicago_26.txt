We have lived in Chicago for 10 years and this was the first time we have taken this tour.  Our daughter was in town and she wanted to do this and we said why not...and we were not disappointed.  Johnny Rocco and Johnny Three Knives were very entertaining and informative. I would surely recommend this tour to folks who want a different view of Chicago.
