Upon arrival, there has been great customer service, a nice atmosphere and a free taxi for hotel guests. My family and I stayed in a Corner King room with floor to ceiling windows and a large bathroom. The only things in question are few, but the shower is one of them. The "Eco friendly" shower that merely drizzles water on you with complicated shower controls. Plus the toilet roll holder fell off it's fastening in the wall, and wouldn't go back on. And lastly, the dim lights in the main bedroom that don't get brighter, and that have switches on them that are half the size of a pin. Otherwise, everything looks great, feels great, and comes with great service ("great, great, great") at the Thompson hotel!
