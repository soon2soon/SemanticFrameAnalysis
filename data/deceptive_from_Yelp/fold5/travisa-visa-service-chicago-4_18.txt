I had a similar experience to Vipul V in San Francisco with the Chicago Travisa office.  We got charged more due to name confusion with another Travisa.  My friends paid $55 less each.   For the extra $110 we paid, we got the "benefit" of shuffling our documents 1 1/2 blocks up State street to their sister office (a 3-minute walk).  Why create this type of misdirection just to line your pockets? When I called to inquire about this, I just got a technical defense - basically: we didn't twist your arm, we got away with it, and better luck next time.  Not the best attitude. Yes, the question above provides its own answer. Vipul V wrote: "If you want an Indian Visa, DO NOT go [to the one on Sutter Street].   Go, instead, to Travisa on 965 Mission St.  Only the Mission St. Travisa ... has a contract from Indian consulate.  The Sutter St Travisa just sends over your passport to Mission St Travisa, takes longer and charges you more, while taking advantage of the name collision." This is a very cynical business model. Why not determine income for both locations and charge the same average unit price instead?
