We stayed in the Lady D Suite and it exceeded our expectation.  The room decor, along with the cleanliness and those 12ft ceilings was absolutely stunning! The overall ambiance of the house along with the hospitality of the Innkeepers is something that I will never forget.  It was an awesome experience and the food was great!
