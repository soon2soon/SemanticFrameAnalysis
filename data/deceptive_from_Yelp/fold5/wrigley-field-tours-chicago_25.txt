What an experience.  I am from the West Coast and have been to several ball parks in my life.  This is by far the best for watching a game.  Every seat is excellent.  We went to a game the same day as our tour. Our tour began right at the ticket windows and the tickets are $30.00 per person.  That seemed a bit steep, but the tour is actually well over an hour in length.  We were fortunate enough to get a gentleman whom had grown up right there by the field, named Tom.  He was outstanding!!!!!  He was very informative regarding the history of the old ball field and the excitement radiated while he spoke about his favorite team.  I am by no means a Cub fan, but after spending an hour with Tom I certainly had a new appreciation for them.  We sat in several sections of the stands (bleachers, upper deck, baseline, etc) and Tom talked the entire time.  The hour flew by and it was amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone in the Chicago area.  I'm sure that all of the tour guides were wonderful, as the other tourists had smiles on their faces when our group passed, but Tom should be commended for his passion.  Thank you Tom!
