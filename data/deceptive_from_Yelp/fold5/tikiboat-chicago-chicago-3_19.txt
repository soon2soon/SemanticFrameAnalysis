The NEW Tikiboat is AWESOME!  We just had my bachelorette party on it last weekend. The boat is nice and the bathroom very clean.  Yelp still has pictures of the old Tikiboat up, they should up date them. Captain Joey was sweet and got us ice ahead of time so we didn't have to worry about it.  He took up past Navy Pier and then to the Play Pen. The water was warm and the slide was incredible.
