I'd recommend The Godfrey to anyone visiting Chicago and I plan to use them the next time I visit Chicago.  I had interactions with the valet, front desk, cleaning staff, bar staff, room service, and breakfast crew and everyone was top-notch, professional, and friendly. My 15th floor view was FANTASTIC!  I could see both the Trump Tower and the Willis Tower in the distance.  I ordered a steak from room service and enjoyed my dinner and the view at the same time. I saw signs for The Urban Roofscape and decided to take a look during my spare time.  The place was so nice, I decided to make an "Emergency Shopping Trip" to Macy's (walking distance away) because I didn't want to visit wearing jeans.  But as it turns out, jeans were okay...lol.  The joint was indoors AND outdoors.  There was a water feature and a FIRE feature.   The bed was the most comfortable I'd ever slept in, in my life.  Another guest told me she felt the same way!  I'm also SOLD on the Keurig coffee maker in the room.  I'm about to go buy one of my own!!! The high-speed wireless internet was fast, reliable, and FREE.  I didn't check for HBO or movie channels.  I had the news playing in the background most of the time. I wouldn't call The Godfrey friendly to smokers, but there is at least a long bench outside in the front to light up. M. A. Bethea Atlanta, GA June 23rd, 2014
