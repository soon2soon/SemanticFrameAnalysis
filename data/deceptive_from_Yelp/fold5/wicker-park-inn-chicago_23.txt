I spent two beautiful days at the Wicker Park inn last week. The "Wicker Park Room" is on the first floor, large, nicely decorated and comfortable. The neighborhood street is quiet and tree-lined and in October, yellow and orange leaves are drifting to the sidewalks. The location is great, and the  neighborhood boasts many excellent  opportunities for finding good food. Guests at the inn can work out at nearby Wicker Park Fitness. As noted in other reviews, the walls are very thin and both nights I could hear the "Law and Order" theme and dialogue. I heard the el, but was not bothered by it, and slept very well. I'd love to stay here again.
