Super clean, friendly staff, well appointed rooms. Highway robbery to park, but that apparently is situation normal in Chicago. Just realize that you could literally walk across the street every morning, rent a new car at Avis and turn it in every night for less $ than it will cost you to park it in the hotel garage. And don't wait til late in the day to park it or there is a very good chance it will be full. Good food in the hotel and the shuttle service is extremely convenient.
