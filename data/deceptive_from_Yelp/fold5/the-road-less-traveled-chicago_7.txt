Road Less Traveled is a special place to work and reflects the values of a small and family-run company committed to creating exceptional outdoor and service-oriented experiences for participants. As an employee this means that you have regular and direct interactions with Donna and Jim as Directors, know everyone who works in the office and have a personal support network available throughout your trip. Donna and Jim have been two of the best bosses I have had in my career. As managers, they demand excellence and create an environment where trip leaders can explore their own leadership skills, hone their technical skills, and go go into the field to create a powerful learning experience for participants. They balance allowing leaders to find their own style and providing constant guidance and feedback, helping you to problem-solve as issues arise and guiding leaders through challenges they face. Having the opportunity to be a trip leader has been the best job I have ever had. Beyond the obvious adventure and satisfaction that comes from working with kids in wilderness and service programs throughout the globe, becoming a trip leader has helped me to understand the type of person I am and the kind of leader I strive to be. Donna and Jim have been integral in helping me to see my strengths and weaknesses and bring me closer to the sort of person I'd like to be. Few bosses are able to so artfully accomplish this. In my five summers of working with Donna and Jim, I have been blown away by their commitment to employees and it has been a pleasure to work with them.
