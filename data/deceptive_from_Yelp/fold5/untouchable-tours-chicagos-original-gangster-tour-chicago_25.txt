This tour was fantastic! I couldn't believe the price for a two-hour bus tour of Chicago with two hilarious and informative guides. "South Side" and "Johnny Three Knives" were funny, really knew there stuff, and made the tour a delight. I saw parts of Chicago that I probably wouldn't have seen if I didn't take this tour, and it was well-worth it! The next time I visit Chicago I will probably take this tour again just for fun! :)
