I was really impressed with the customer service at Wateriders.  I had some friends in from out of town and we had a pretty packed Memorial Day schedule.  Don was really flexible and allowed us to pick several times that worked for our group.  When we arrived the staff was friendly, helpful and offered great suggestions to help make it a perfect day.  I would highly recommend Wateriders and can't wait to do it again.
