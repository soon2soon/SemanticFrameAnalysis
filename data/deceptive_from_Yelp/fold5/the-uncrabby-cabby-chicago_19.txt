I used them the weekend of my brother's wedding and the service was great! The owner picked us up and drove us to the far western suburbs and he couldn't be nicer. He waited patiently as we needed him to take us to a rehearsal, then dinner and finally home. It was a stressful weekend but my Uncrabby Cabby gave me one less thing to worry about.
