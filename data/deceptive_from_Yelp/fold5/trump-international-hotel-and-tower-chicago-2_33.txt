We have enjoyed the Trump several times- staff exceptional, especially MK & the valet gents out front. Front desk staff is always friendly~ lobby is rather small..We have had the wonderful privilege of being upgraded to an exquisite apartment style suite with river view & the beautiful city view. Absolutely breathtaking! We have stayed in most other room styles except on the spa level. They are all fantastic but we were spoiled with the apartment suite! Pool is great with a wonderful view & spa water available. Rooms are very clean,lux, robes, slippers, kids have the same. Our children rave on about this place & Chicago~ they are hooked! Trump staff is extremely accommodating and have done their very best to ensure consistent top notch service! We love walking to all of the great places nearby! we suggest a river view room on a higher floor. During the summer,on certain nights, there are fireworks at the Navy Pier and we have been able to enjoy them from our room! Spectacular! Â The Trump definitely does memorable details well. A visit can be costly,but the Trump does email promotions & this can save you $ ~especially on week night stays.
