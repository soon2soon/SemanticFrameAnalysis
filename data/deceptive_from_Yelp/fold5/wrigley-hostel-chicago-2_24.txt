This hostel was absolutely amazing! I traveled to Chicago on a solo journey and was a little apprehensive before I arrived. Brendan greeted me with a very warm welcome. The hostel is conveniently located near bars in a hip little neighborhood. I wondered around all over that area and felt very safe. Lisa and Brendan (hostel staff) were SO helpful. They guided me through the Redline process and told me I could call at any time for assistance if I needed. The transit system is a short walk from this hostel, which is really handy. Wrigley's itself was so homey and clean. Definitely cleaner than most hotels I've stayed at. Offering free breakfast and pizza dinner was awesome too. They have a nice commons area with WIFI, TV, computers, pool table and a couch. I was able to do a conference call for work in this area with no troubles. When I arrived back to the hostel that night, we all hung out in the kitchen together. If you want somewhere that feels like home, comfortable and affordable, COME TO THIS HOSTEL!
