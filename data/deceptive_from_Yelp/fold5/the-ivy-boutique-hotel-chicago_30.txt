Great hotel.The service at all levels is top-notch. The room was extremely clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The bed was divine - I only wish I could have enjoyed it longer! I had a suite with a separate sitting area, with flat screen TV's and comfortable furniture in both the bedroom and living room.This hotel is a great choice if you're looking for luxury in a beautiful, close to many attractions.
