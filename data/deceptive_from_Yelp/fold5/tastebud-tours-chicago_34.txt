The tour was GREAT! We were so glad to get the owner/president of the company leading our tour, but we've heard that all the guides are just as great. The portions of food were huge, and we were stuffed about halfway through the tour--pace yourself! Also, there were bathroom breaks worked into the tour, and something to drink at each stop, which was nice, and isn't always part of other food tours. My husband and I had just gotten married two days earlier, and we were also with a guy celebrating his birthday. Our guide made special accommodations and called ahead to get "Congrats" cupcakes for us at one stop, and even a bottle of champagne at the last stop. That was really sweet and made our tour even more memorable! We'd recommend this tour to everyone. What a great way to learn about Chicago and taste some really great authentic food!
