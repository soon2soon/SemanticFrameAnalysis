I had previously stayed at The James with only great experiences so I wasn't prepared for the bad experience this time around. To start, service has gone downhill.There was a complete disegard for pre-stated room preferences and instead I was placed on low floor, next to elevator and street facing. When I asked to be moved, I was advised there were no other room options. Besides having a very noisy room, the amenties in my room were not consistently replenished and room was dirty. I then met some guests in the bar who had items stolen from their room. To top it off, they charged the wrong credit card for my stay. They did not apologize for this oversight and instead I am asked to fill out a form before this can be corrected. One inconvenience after another. They need to revisit their priorities, as again, when they first opened, they were top on my list. Sadly no more...
