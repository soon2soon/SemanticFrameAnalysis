If you are going to choose to go kayaking down the Chicago River DO NOT choose Waterriders! A few weeks ago we did the night kayaking tour with Waterriders. It was pretty pricey ($55 each for 4 of us). We were promised 2.5 hours of kayaking.  What we got was a SUPER late start, a huge group, a few stories along the way about Chicago (that you couldn't hear), and a MASSIVE rain storm that almost overturned our kayak on the way back. We understand the weather was not under their control, but they knew the rain was coming and should have turned us around earlier. I seriously feared for the safety of first time kayakers out there...but our guides didn't seem to care.  Despite our tour being cut very short (by at least an hour) and the horrible weather on the way back they refused to refund us any money.   I recc that if you want to kayak down the river to rent kayaks on your own thru another company. DO NOT use waterriders and don't do a tour (huge wate of $!) On a positive note...Chicago is beautiful at night and it is great seeing it while kayaking down the river...
