The hotel room and especially the roof-top bar were great.  However, when I got my car back from the valet service, someone had cut away the spare wheel (full aluminum wheel and stock mfg tire) from underneath the body.  The valet service said they did not have any cameras in the garage where my car was stored -- so I have to believe they are just operating according to their own convenience. I called The Wit front desk who transferred me to the valet service, but neither had any answers, nor any suggestions for recompense. I will be paying more than the cost of my stay at The Wit and my fun in their great bar to replace the spare wheel that was stolen in their custody.  If I ever go back to The Wit again, I will not trust them with my car, because the valet service cannot maintain security.
