We went on the Weird and Haunted tour with Clarence as our guide, and we had a great experience. The tour itself offers a good look into the past of Chicago with everything from the Mob and disasters, to serial killers and haunted places. The tour guide made it something we will always remember. Clarence was so full of personality, very knowledgeable about the areas on the tour and the history that occurred in Chicago, and his passion for the subject was obvious. After taking this tour, we wish we had more time to take some of the other tours with this company. The bus was unmarked, but guide asked the group of people which tour we were taking so he wouldn't miss anyone. The bus had A/C and the tour allowed us to get off and on the bus to really experience the tour. The buses line up on Clark St between the Hard Rock and McDonald's so it was easy to spot. Great experience, well worth the time and money!
