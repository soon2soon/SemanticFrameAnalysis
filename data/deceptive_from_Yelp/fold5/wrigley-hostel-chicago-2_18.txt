Hello, I stayed at the Wrigley Hostel 12/30 and 12/31 for New Year's.  I was very pleased!  The first reason was that it was a 9 minute walk to the Vic Theater (where the concerts were) and the hostel gave me FREE street parking passes for each night so I never had to drive.  The street the hostel is on was not super trafficky and there were a few open parking spots close to the front door.  Another great thing was that the staff were both very nice and tried to make my stay the best it could possibly be.  I stayed in the 4-bed female only room downstairs and I loved it!  My bed was soooo comfy. I felt so comfy and cozy throughout the whole hostel the whole time.  I will definitely stay there the next time I'm in Chicago.  Thank you! :) -Erika
