if i could give 0 star rating i would!!!!! my hubby and i went to Chicago on 7/12/14 for our 3 years anniversary let me tell you if we would of stayed in MI it would of been so much better. The staff at this hotel are absolutely horrible including the Manager.They have a $250 fee that they hold your acct. as soon as you walk in the doors! We did not know about that  when i booked the room for us back in June on Expedia no where on the booking did it say that! so the one staff member told us we would help us out coming from MI and gave us it for only $150 watch is still BS but he worked with us so we say ok. the room wasn't ready yet so we went and did some stuff walked around came back at about 5 pm their was a different staff member let me tell you he was a asshole! he just took my card and ran it for the $250 without telling me til after the fact i was pissed we told him the guy in the morning gave it to us for $150  and just did not care what we had to say at all he told us if we don't like it we can get the FUCK out! we then went crazy asked for the manger he said there is no manager right now but i tell you something when it got loud in the lobby and manger came out. The manger really didn't care what we had to say at all he was just pissed that the other guy told us $150. we ended up getting all of are money back from the room and stopped the $250 and drove back home to MI the same day go got there. just asshole's running the hole hotel!
