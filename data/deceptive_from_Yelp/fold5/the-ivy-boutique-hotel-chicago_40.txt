Stayed here July 14-15, 2012. Website looks great, and the rooms are nice, but the systems in the hotel are terrible. Both TV's in our room (and all in hotel, from what I gathered from other guests and management) have major issues with cutting out every 15-20 minutes, leaving a blank or pixilated screen for 2-4 minutes at a time. Shower actually just stopped putting out water at more than say 5% of normal power (just a trickle) about every minute on some sort of weird cycle. It was like they were turning the water off for a half minute at a time, every minute or so. Also, the water was never really hot, just luke warm. Climate control locked at a max cool of 67F and it wouldn't keep the room comfortable in the summer Worst, the management/manager was totally unhelpful. Called about fixing the issues only after we checked out! Great, how does that help? Then he wouldn't even discount the rate a penny, telling us he'd take $59 off the publicized rate of $259 for a king suite (what we have). Great offer, not! We would have to go back to this hotel just to get anything from this hotel, something we were not willing to do. Avoid! There are far better choices in Chicago with TV's, showers and climate controls that work. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the hotel didn't have our room ready when we checked in after their check in time. Nice, eh? Mike
