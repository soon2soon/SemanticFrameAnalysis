I cannot believe the customer service is this bad at ANY hotel.   We are native to downtown Chicago,  and thought we would like to find a nice hotel to frequent on our trips "home"  this is NOT one I would ever recommend!   The room itself it nice. Quite clean, and comfortable. Not perfect though, the rugs are sort of taped down and pucker so watch your step.  The toilet needed a wipe down ( I do this at any hotel I stay at) The internet service was sketchy at best (worked about 20% of the time) The towels we were given on the last day were not clean and had hairs stuck to them.  Gross.   Okay, getting past the small stuff, be careful what you sign there.  We though we were pre-paying for our 4 day stay.  Plus a charge of 250.00 for a incidentals hold.  I have no problem with paying for a hold, like a security deposit, or mini bar insurance.  However we were charged twice for our room and with NO apology!!!  Now we have to wait and see if we will be refunded our money.  The hotel manager had the nerve to swear at me twice today (using the s word) and tell me that because I was upset with being charged twice I talk with my hands and he has my "so called rant" on camera.  He actually threatened to call his attorney. ????  for what???  WOW.  Maybe I should call mine?  Apparently they have no idea what customer service is, and I have done nothing wrong.  We just would like not to be charged double, plus security charge for our 4 day stay.   Next time I will be booking our trip home at another hotel.  Wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy- - - well maybe. I hope the owner of this hotel reads this, I don't like to be sworn at by anyone on the phone.  Thank you.
