Honestly. I loved the deco, the cleanlines and the conservative/ modern serene atmosphere. Their high society tea was a complete joke. The server forgot the champagne,  snacks were stale and tasteless. I usually go to the Drake or Peninsula but decided to go to Langham because we couldn't find a reservation anywhere else. I couldn't  stomach all the snacks. Valet attendants were very friendly. As a matter of fact I had left about $2300 in my glove compartment and when I got my car back all the money was there. The front desk staff were not attentive. We got there around 2.40pm and the Tea Lobby hadn't open yet. The front desk staff asked us to sit in the waiting area because they Lobby was not yet open. Well: 3pm lobby opened and no one came to fetch us and we were sitting 4 feet from the front desk.  3.18pm As we saw people go to the lobby and decided to follow. The staff is notebook professional, there ware no smilling faces nor friendly personalities. Everything seemed to be hardcore by the book, staff had no personality and no smilling faces. I personally wouldn't go back!  I'll probably recommend it as a wedding venue because the place  looks very sophisticated and much cleaner than Trump Tower Hotel. 2 Stars for the valet staff and the cleanliness. All the cute picture plates I saw on Yelp for the High Tea, I didn't get any of that. I don't know if they change their menu daily but there were no cute mini burgers nor desert in a glass like most pictures. Again our server forgot our champagne so who knows what I got. SIGH! Buyers remorse.......Very Disappointed!
