I am a program coordinator for multiple venues in Chicago, and I have to take my hat off to the staff, the ambiance & the organic energy that flowed throughout this amazing venue. I visited the Godfrey with a few friends and inquired about seating. A young lady by the name of Sandi ( who was one of the heads of state for the Godfrey ) politely asked me to wait a moment. She returned shortly and introduced me to hosts that were able to accommodate my group. Our group ordered some of the small plates, which were incredibly delicious. I also ordered a few pictures of the signature margaritas, made with all fresh ingredients. My group enjoyed the cocktails as well. This will be Chicagos hottest spot! Let me not forget the staff from the entry to the operations of the I/O were extremely professional, efficient, knowledgeable & courteous! 5 stars all day.
