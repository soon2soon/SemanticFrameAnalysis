My son just returned from his first RLT trip and once again the reports of experiences and adventure were all that were promised.  He is our youngest and our older two children both participated in two RLT trips with similar experiences so we were not surprised by his positive reviews of every part of the trip.  What makes RLT trips special are the subtle changes that occur in the kids through how and what they experience and how the staff at RLT reinforce these experiences as more than just part of the service or adventure but the meaning it has to the participants emotional, intellectual and social growth and maturation process.  RLT staff go WAY beyond what is expected of them.  They keep your child safe, expose them to great things but also are there for every possible issue that might arise, and with teenagers that can mean so many issues!  Thanks to the Jim and Donna for creating such a wonderful program and thanks to Emma one of the great counselors (of many) for providing experiences and lessons that will last a lifetime.
