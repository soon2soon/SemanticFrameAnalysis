I do not recommend staying here to anyone!! Spent 2 nights here at $500 a night.  Started off fighting our way thru a crowd of claddly dressed club goers/wedding guests to find the front desk to check in. Had a credit card auth form on file days before arriving, but had to call to get approval to charge it. Not what we wanted to deal with after a 7 hour drive.  The next day we received multiple calls stating the form had not come thru, that was already on file.  Then the mini bar fridge wasn't working... Everything in it was warm.  They sent up a tech who told us it was offline and wouldn't be picked up on the system if we moved things over to the working fridge.... So the follow morning we get a bill for over $200 for moving the warm beverages to be chilled as we were told to. The remote for the tv didn't work.  They did send a new up one right away.  Pretty sure we got food poisoning from the fried chicken at the restaurant.  Upon check out which we requested a late Hilton honors check out, we got locked out of our room and then told we could not get our car from valet until a credit card was on file....AGAIN.... VERY RUDE and incompetent front desk staff. For being a paying hotel guest, we we're treated better  by the homeless man out front.  Will never return and neither should you! Stay clear!
