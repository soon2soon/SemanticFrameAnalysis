My two best friends from college and I try to take a trip every year and this summer we visited Chicago. We also try to read a book about the city we are visiting and this year we read The Devil in the White City so naturally we chose this tour and we were not disappointed. Our tour guide, Greg, was very entertaining - YEAH! - and knew tons about not only the Holmes case, but also about the World's Fair, Chicago architecture, the city's history and whatnot, and a little bit of just about everything else having to do with Chicago. We were entertained and informed and had a really great evening. The bus was also Â very comfortable on a day with 100+ temps. One word of caution - there is a little bit of walking involved that might be a bit difficult for anyone with weak knees, but overall we highly recommend this tour.
