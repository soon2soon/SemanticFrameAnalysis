I booked my rehearsal dinner at the hotel , their banquet room is very elegant I absolutely love the chandeliers and the floors. They were very accommodating also created a perfect menu for our dinner. We had a block of rooms reserved with them , the rooms are very well designed a large space for downtown location, the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Thank you everyone at Ivy you are the best.
