I take this tour at least once a year when out of town visitors stay with us and in my opinion it is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable signtseeing trip anybody can take when visiting Chicago.  You get a perspective of the city that you can't get anywhere else than on a boat cruising up and down the Chicago River.  I have been fortunate to have outstanding tour guides that know the city like the back of their hands and I am always amazed that I learn something new about the city I have lived in all my life and that I love everytime I take this tour.  In my opinion, this is a ten star trip and should not be missed if you live in or are visiting Chicago.  I would recommend you take the trip before the temperature drops.  I remember taking the tour late in the season when the temerature was in the 60's and it was a little cold, but that is no Wendella's fault.  If its cold bunlde up, bring a blanket and enjoy one of the best views of the city of Chicago.
