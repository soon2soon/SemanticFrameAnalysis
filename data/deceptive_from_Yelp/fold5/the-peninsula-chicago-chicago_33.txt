It's hard to imagine how a palace of pure luxury and exemplary customer service exists in the middle of a tough town like Chicago.  I think this is simply the best hotel in this city.  I stayed here several times and all the times the service was simply impeccable.  The rooms are comfortable and the beds and the bedding are excellent - very comfortable.  The food is great as well.  I had room service, also I had breakfast buffet, and the food in their Japanese restaurant, and the tea service, of course.  It has all worked out perfectly for me. The gym is fantastic.  I once had to stay at another hotel about ten blocks away just because they were sold out for the convention at the Peninsula.  So, I got up very early morning, checked out of my crappy hotel and hiked to the Peninsula, bags and all, had breakfast buffet and then went to work out.  I like to do stair master.  And the stair masters here are fantastic -they show you the terrain you are doing and it keeps the workout from getting boring.  I selected "around the world" and did one hour on the stair master - an unprecedented amount of time for me - in a flash.  The view is incomparable and very uplifting and inspiring. I think if you live in town, you can actually get membership in the gym and work out.  Highly recommend it.  I would move in here and live here, if I could.  But, I would have to be much richer, I think for that to happen.
