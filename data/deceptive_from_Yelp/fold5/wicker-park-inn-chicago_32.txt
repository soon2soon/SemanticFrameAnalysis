Overall, my experience at WPI was pleasant. The innkeeper was so charming I wanted to pack him up and take him with me! It's a good neighborhood, especially for dining, and everything was clean and serviceable. However, "serviceable" is about it in some places and they missed a lot of details. I stayed in Cape Cod, which was okay but the bathroom had a lot of problems: no soap at all for the sink; exposed anchors in the wall from a previously mounted shelf; the pedestal sink overhangs the toilet so you have to lean forward while using the toilet because there's not enough room; the shower floor is wobbly; the waterproofing was gone from the shower door, letting water out onto the floor, etc. This bathroom could use a serious upgrade. I peeked into other rooms, and they were all nicer than the Cape Cod. If I came back, I'd get the lovely black-and-white room on the ground floor. It has far more privacy than the upstairs rooms, but is still on the quieter (non-train) side of the building. It is by the front door, however. A note to Cape Cod residents: Your door is directly next to the Provence room. Since their bathroom is down the hall, guests in that room tend to open and close their door frequently, which can be loud. I recommend ear plugs, since there isn't much sound insulation. On the flip side, the train noise wasn't a problem for me. Breakfast isn't much. I tried a muffin that was awful, but the danish was good. There was no cream of any kind for coffee, which is a major oversight. Eat at the Bongo Room instead!
