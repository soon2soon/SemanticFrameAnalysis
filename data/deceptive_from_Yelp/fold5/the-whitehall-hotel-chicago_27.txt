Got a great deal on hotwire and was so excited to spend my birthday in Chicago! First, we didn't have a ton of money to begin with and they charged us a $75 a night incidental fee, great $125 that I planned on having that I now don't. Then when we get to our room there was no way of latching the bathroom door, the toilet handle looks like it will fall off at any minute and the mini fridge is locked! They don't offer free wiring, and the TV is very Shotty. It is however in a great location, we spent most of our time outside.
