I am (embarrassingly) not usually a review writer although I base a lot of my decisions on the reviews of others. This time I felt I needed to share my wonderful experience when I used The Uncrabby Cabby. The driver was on time, communication was easy, the cab was clean, and he got me to my destination in a timely and safe manner. The owner?, Phil, responded promptly to my questions via and e-mail and phone. And let's be honest, the name and logo make you smile. I will definitely use them again the next time I am in town.
