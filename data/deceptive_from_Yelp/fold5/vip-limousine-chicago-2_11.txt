last weekend, i threw a surprise birthday party for my sister. i was so nervous becuase it's a big deal, and my sister is super picky.  i reserved their 36 passenger vip edition party bus.  it's the new one.  it was so pretty!  lights everywhere, awesome sound, and the driver was on point the whole night. i really can't say there were any issues i could even complain about!  the office was always helpful when i had last minute changes.  had a great experience with these guys.
