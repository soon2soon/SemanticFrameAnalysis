From the moment we walked in, we knew it would be an incredible experience. To start, we were given a complimentary room upgrade. Therefore, our room was large, clean and luxurious. Then, we got a knock on the door and a man was there handing me a box of wine truffles with a note wishing me a happy birthday (my birthday was the night before). It was such a pleasant gesture. The hotel was great. The staff was extremely friendly, the rooms were made up promptly, and the hotel included some very cool additions such as an apple tv that was easy to use among other things. Overall, when I come back to Chicago, I will definitely return to the Talbott Hotel. The location is excellent as it's not even a 2 minute walk from the Magnificent Mile. Bravo!
