I stayed one night over the weekend for the Air & Water Show.  The Hotel was beautiful and the rooftop was awesome.  We stayed in a King Suite which was huge it had everything we needed and then some.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Everything was great until we went back to pick up the car and bags that they offered to hold for us after check out.  The Bell Hop couldn't find a shopping bag full of wine that we did the previous day.  He offered to call me if they would find it and then offered me money out of his pocket for the value of what was in the bag which he didn't even give me the full amount.  I was pretty calm with this situation as it could of been worse and it could of been our personal belongings.  If you offer a service please make sure it is properly done.  Also, if you charge 250.00 dollar for accidents or any additional clean up for the room advise your guests that the 250.00 will be credited to the account within so many business days.
