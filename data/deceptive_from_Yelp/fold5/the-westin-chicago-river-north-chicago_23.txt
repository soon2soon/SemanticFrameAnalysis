Nice hotel with nice rooms. If you need a cab in the morning don't trust them to get it for you. We called 30 minutes ahead of time to get a cab at 530 in the morning. We get down there on time and they tell us the cab hasn't arrived yet but we can pay $75 to take their limo to the airport! No thank you!!! Double the cost of what it is for a cab .... My husband knew immediately they were jerking us around and went to find us a cab by himself on the street... Came back 5-10 minutes later with a cab no problem! While I was waiting the bell man didn't even bother to update me, but I did ask him where my cab was and he said oh I'll check on that for you now.... Shouldn't you have done that immediately when I came down here??? Our cab driver confirmed that you can go on a yellowcab app service and request a cab and it will be there within 10 minutes. The hotel works with their own car company and the company tips the bellman for getting the guest to use the overpriced car instead of a cab. I don't appreciate being lied to by the hotel staff... And Pedro, the bellman told me it was the MANAGER who called the cab for us. So we were lied to by the manager. They could have made us late for our plane making us wait that long
