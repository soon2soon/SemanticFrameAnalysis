I hired Windy City Trolley for my wedding day because a friend of mine had hired them for her bachelorette party and it was really fun and easy.  I liked how clean and sleak the trolley was and she said it was a great experience overall.  She was totally right!  The day of the wedding the driver picked us up at the hotel, took us to the church and then waited and took us to the reception in Lincoln Park. He was so nice and everything looked great.  The whole process was very easy and much more reasonably priced than the other companies I researched.  I would recommend this company to anyone.
