I used Windy City Trolley for my 30th Birthday and couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received!  Out of town guests surprised me and WCT went above and beyond for me with last minute accomodations - with it being February and having inclimate weather  it was so nice to have the trolley take us around.  And from a logistics stand point everything was handled in a very professional and timely manner.   I hope to use them again soon and would recommend their services to any family member or friend!
