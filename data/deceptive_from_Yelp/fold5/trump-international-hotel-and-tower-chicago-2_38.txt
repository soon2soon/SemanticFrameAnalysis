Trump hotel occupancy was full during our stay. Yet the entire Trump staff behaved as if my wife and I were the only guests on the property. That perception is a reality. Their attention to detail and overall outstanding service is second to none! We have stayed in many five star resorts & hotels (including our most recent stay at The St. Regis - Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point, CA), but Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago "TRUMPED" them all. We will add Trump properties to our consideration list for future travels. Thank you for a delightful experience!
