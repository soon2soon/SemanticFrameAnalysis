I called Janet Rhines in search of an affordable vacation for my boyfriend and I. She recommended Mexico and a few all inclusive resorts she thought we would enjoy. We booked our trip about two weeks later for Dreams Riviera Cancun Resort. Best decision I have ever made. She was spot on in helping us find a place we would love. We had the greatest time and will definitely use her again to book our next trip. It was so simple and painless. I never thought it would be so easy to plan and book a vacation!
