Bought a Youswoop architectural tour from Wateriders and when I tried to book for it, the guy on the phone insisted he knew nothing of it and was incredibly, unbelievably rude to me. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!!! I don't know if the problem was with Youswoop or with Wateriders, but the guy's rudeness was way out of line and enough for me to write this review. NO WAY I would ever give them a penny!
