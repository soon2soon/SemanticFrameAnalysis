I went on the South side Tastebud Tour and had a wonderful time. The tour guide, Lynn really loves his job and it shows in how he interacted with us! The food was delicious and they were hardly samples. I had a full stomach by the end of the tour. My favorite stop was at Pizano's Pizza. The pizza was great and they have a rich history here in Chicago. The tour is also a great way to see the city for a reasonable price!
