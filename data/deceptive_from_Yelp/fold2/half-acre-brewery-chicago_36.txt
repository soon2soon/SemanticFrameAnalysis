Do you like really friendly people who are happy to share knowledge of very focused topics? Do you have a mouth? Do you like putting delicious fluids in it? If you answered yes to all of the above, this place might be for you. I'm not from Chicago: I live in DC and spend a lot of time in Brooklyn like any other good beer-lovin', early 30s yuppie with hipster tendencies. My friends and I went to Half Acre to have some beers and just felt really, really welcome. My friends brew and one works for Brooklyn Gin distillers, and the entire staff was happy and eager to just talk about booze in a really open, non-snobby way. Then, when we mentioned we were from out of town and were really hoping to try Double Daisy Cutter, even though this year's batch hadn't been released yet---dude goes back, grabs us a bottle, splits it with us. That's just class. Keep making good beers, Half Acre. Keep being good folk.
