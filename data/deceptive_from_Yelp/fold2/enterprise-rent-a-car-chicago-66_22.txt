Renting a car from Enterprise Car Rental on 850 N. State street was a great choice. I just walked in and was met with a smile, the lady called Jess was extremely helpful and professional. She was fast, efficient and friendly. The experience was great and the service exceptional, the car was new and spotless and the process easy. Both Jess and Lauren always smile and are very helpful and lived up to my expectations of the friendliness of people in Chicago. Â  You can't go wrong with renting a car from them.
