I'm newer to living in Chicago, and love this way to see the city. Â Reader's digest: - On a sunny day, nothing beats a good bike ride, with delicious and different food stops - Dimitra and Sharon know their stuff about all things "food" in Chicago (and I'm a foodie) - The places selected on the trips are very relavant to the theme and provide great exposure to places I might not normally go - The tour travels at a pace that accommodates all levels of biking comfort. - You can experience several establishments, and absorb as you go because you are on bike. I've done the Vegetarian and Asian Tours - Well done Sharon and Dimitra! Lexie
