I was recommended two other car services in Chicago, but after doing some research, I chose Echo Limousine.  Am I glad I did!  We were picked up at the airport by Cornell, who was wonderful.   My friend also had Cornell drive him on a day trip to the burbs a couple of days later.  Both I and my friend (separately) used Echo for service back to O'Hare.  They were always on time (actually early), the drivers (particularly Cornell) were pleasant and drove well, and the cars were immaculate. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
