My husband and I have been on two tours with this company- The Chocolate Tour and The Cupcake Tour. I would recommend both! We personally liked The Chocolate Tour the best, sine we just love chocolate :) My husband and I went on the Cupcake Tour yesterday with Seth Davis and were not disappointed! He knows a lot of interesting facts about Chicago and the buildings we passed on the tour. He was able to inform us and entertain us with his humor. The cupcakes were pretty delicious too! Thanks Seth!
