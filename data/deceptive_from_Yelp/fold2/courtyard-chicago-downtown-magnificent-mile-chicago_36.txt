My husband and I stay in the city quite often. This was our first stay at Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. We will be back! Everything was perfect and the location was phenomenal. We were on the concierge level and a quick drink or breakfast fantastic view of the lake and a great experience.
