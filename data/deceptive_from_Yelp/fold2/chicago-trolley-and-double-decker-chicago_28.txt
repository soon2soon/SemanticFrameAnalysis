We recently used the Chicago Trolley and Double Decker bus tour for our family of four on a short trip to Chicago.  We parked at Navy Pier, picked up our ticket booklets, and boarded the bus...got the back bench seat, very comfy for our family of four! We had some great tourguides and learned a lot about the city on our loops around the signature tour.  The weather was a little warm for Chicago (apparently, we're from Atlanta, so we didn't notice) but the breeze generated by the bus driving around made for a pleasant ride. The information given was interesting and fun.  We had no trouble getting a seat on the top of the bus anytime we wanted and the busses ran very frequently so getting off and on was no trouble at all. The free tee shirt was a very thin white one, but a neat add on.  The free Garrett's popcorn sample was actually a nice size portion too! We can't wait to go back to Chicago and use this company again!
