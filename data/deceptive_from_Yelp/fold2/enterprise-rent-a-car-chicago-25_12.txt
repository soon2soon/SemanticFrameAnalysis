I had an awful experience with this Enterprise. Brian, the manager, was way too personal, and used a lot of discretion in behaving offensively. Does my experience invalidate others' positive reviews? Not at all. The customer service and smiles are great! As long as you don't wade into a conversation about what is actually in their contract! My situation wasn't a typical scenario: my car was in the shop, and there was miscommunication about my insurance policy coverage (which didn't cover a rental car in my scenario). And if insurance does not cover a rental car, the renter is liable for the total costs. (This is in Enterprise's contract, which I signed.) I told Brian (the manager) that, had known I could potentially be on the hook with no warning, I wouldn't have rented for a week; a better policy is to be told "you should check your policy to be sure." I asked that Brian to consider finding a solution that didn't place the burden of Enterprise's miscommunication squarely on me. Instead, of talking about policies, and rules and laws, Brian came at me like a drunk person at a bar: "Just like the insurance company, and the mechanic, a rental company has to make money too!" (sorry, not my problem) "I don't care if you ever come back or not!" (actually you do, from the sound of your concern with money in the last statement) "In seven years, I've never had anyone call back the way have!" The sad part is Brian hung up after the last statement, as if to prove that he knows best. But he didn't know that I'm a college professor, and that I understand business law.
