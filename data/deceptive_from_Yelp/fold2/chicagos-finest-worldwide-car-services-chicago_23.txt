I used this service 3 times because of the Groupon special.  I live Downtown.  On each occasion, the driver was early (!).  The driver was very polite and the car was spotlessly clean. The driver "went the extra mile" in handling our golf clubs and luggage.   I understand there have been issues with Groupon but our service was excellent.  I have used many other limo services, but will use them again--even at full price.
