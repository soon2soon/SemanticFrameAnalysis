The hotel did allow us to check in early, but the room was not clean (we had to pick up things off the floor and we could see major dust build-up), the beds were uncomfortable and seemed unusually small.  The elevator was extremely slow and the ice machine on our floor was out of order; I had to ask the housekeeper where to find ice.   Housekeeping barged in at 7:30 am and told us she was there to clean.  We weren't even dressed, but rushed to allow her to "clean". The staff was very nice; however, this would not be my first choice if I return to Chicago.
