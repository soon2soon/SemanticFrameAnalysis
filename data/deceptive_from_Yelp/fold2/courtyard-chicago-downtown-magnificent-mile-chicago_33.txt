Booked Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile hotel through price line by requesting 4 star. Have stayed in many Chicago 4 and 5 star hotels before. There was a Bears game so all prices were up and we were just staying one night so did the whole bid thing. Did not feel it fell into same category as other 4 star hotels in the area. Always a line for one of the 5 elevators ( that hold 3!) people with luggage. Head bartender not happy with his job. Room 3 1/2 star. Fine for a one night stay in a good location but if you want 4-5 star accommodations look elsewhere. super expensive WiFi.
