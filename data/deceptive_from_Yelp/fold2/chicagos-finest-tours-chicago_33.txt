My mother and I did the underground pedway tour and we both loved it. The tour guide was dynamic and knowledgeable and entertaining, and we learned a lot about our city that we thought we knew everything about. This is a great tour for locals and it will make your morning commute to work so much easier once you figure out the pedway system. Well worth the cost of the tickets - highly recommended!
