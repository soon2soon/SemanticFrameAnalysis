This is my first Yelp! review and I am glad it is for Enterprise on State St. I travel a lot for business and don't even think twice about where I rent, it is always Enterprise. Lauren, Rain and the entire Enterprise staff makes the rental from start to finish a breeze. Lauren does a great job of managing her customers and steering a great ship! The cars are always clean and ready to go when I arrive. I have recommended this location to my family and friends that live in the area. Whether you are a local to Chicago or visiting and needed a downtown rental, Enterprise is your place to go! I have been in customer service for 10 years and this is the best customer service I have seen in a long time! In a world where customer service and good employees are fizzing out, it is good to know that Enterprise is always top knotch quality.
