Global Adrenaline has planned two trips for me, one to Peru (Machu Picchu, the rainforest, Lima) and the other to SE Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand).  They're fantastic.  They made the entire trip planning incredibly easy, arranged for transportation and had expert knowledge of hotels, spots to visit, and guides when they were helpful.  Their knowledge and planning made our trips (and pre-trip planning) smooth and wonderful!
