Stayed in a suite this weekend. Â The service was great, the accommodations superb in everyway. Had the harmony massage in the spa which was fantastic. The lounge was dead on Friday and Saturday, as they no longer have any live music.. They are in the process of changing the lounge and restaurant. Not sure how this is going to play out. We wound up heading over to the Penninsula for some jazz. All in all, it was a great stay.
