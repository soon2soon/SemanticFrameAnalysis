As past residents of Chicago we knew this location was perfect. Great neighbohood-true Chicago feel. Great shops, restaurants, etc.  The L is right across the street. We were able to use it easily to go to other places downtown. The apartment is very clean, and well taken care of.  Great outdoor space as well.
