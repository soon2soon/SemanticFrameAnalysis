Sorry to say that I convinced 9 family members to take the chocolate tour of Chicago. Three of the businesses advertised didn't even participate any more. One of the businesses wasn't open on Sunday (then why book it and advertise for it) so we got two samples at one location. The Ghiardelli's stop included one free square of chocolate (WHICH EVERYONE WHO WALKED IN TO SHOP GOT) AND A 10% DISCOUNT!  What a waste.  All the tour guides do is walk you into the store, offer a 10 or 20% discount, and get you one or two small samples or a mini cupcake. There is no "enticing information" or interaction with the businesses at all.  The guide was a nice lady (and we tipped her) but this tour would never be worth the $40.00 or even the half price Groupon...
