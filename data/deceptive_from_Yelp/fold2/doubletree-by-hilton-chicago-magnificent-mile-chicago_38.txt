I've spent a lot of nights - sometimes a month in a row - in the Doubletree in Atlanta as a Hilton Honors member.  I've spent a lot of nights as a travelling engineer in other hotel chains. SEVEN DOLLARS to use the in-room coffee maker.  I have never seen any other hotel or hotel chain charge for the in-room coffee machine.  One cup - SEVEN DOLLARS.  My previous stay they charged me an extra $50 for being ten minutes over the parking garage time.  Note I didn't call it "my last stay", because this was my last stay here ever.  It's like the Spirit Airlines of hotels.  Their damn cookie does not offset the bitter taste in my mouth these petty, unethical people left. I hope you guys enjoy your $6.80 worth of negative publicity, jerks!
