This hotel was not worth the money!!! I have stayed here twice, once with some girlfriends and second for a family wedding.  I came back with trepidation the second time-but because this was the venue where it was hosted-what a mistake. Rooms-are tired and old.  They smell musty-in feels like the carpets may have never been cleaned. Service-stayed two nights on our second visit.  We left the hotel room early in the am to explore the city.  We came back at 4pm.  Our room had not been cleaned yet!! We called to get clean towels-it took 45 minutes for the housekeeper to come, and then she asked, "I guess you are okay with me not cleaning?" It was like she didn't want to do her job. The food is free-that is true-but that is because you wouldn't pay for it.  There is ONE omelet line (Usually 20-30 minutes long-and everything else is either cold, or gummy. Parking is exorbitant even for the area. It also takes forever for them to get your car (more than 20 minutes both times) Pool-is PACKED every time our kids went.  It was wall to wall people. The Doubletree next door is Much nicer for the same cost.
