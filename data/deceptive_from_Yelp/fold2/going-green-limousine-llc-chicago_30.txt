WHAT AN AMAZING AND AWESOME COMPANY!!!  I was nervous about choosing a limousine service in a city I am not familiar with for a weekend event for my company - long distance. I chose Going Green because the reviews for them on Yelp! were so stellar.  I was not disappointed!!!  I personally was not able to experience their car service, but my boss cannot stop raving about them. It's just a wonderful plus that all their vehicles are environmentally friendly. I scheduled at least five trips, with two different-sized vehicles, over the course of the weekend. My boss reported that each and every time the cars were impeccably clean and the drivers timely and incredibly helpful. My boss also stated that the drivers' appearances were not only professional and neat, but they were elegantly attired. The drivers' went above and beyond with the help they provided to some of the members of my boss' party as they had some minor physical disabilities and could not easily enter or exit the vehicles. I did personally speak with Rebecca when making the reservations and she could not have been sweeter, more helpful, or professional. I coordinate the fundraising activities for my company all over the US and Going Green Limousine is, by far, the best company - in any category - I have had the pleasure to work with. I truly wish they had locations in all the major cities, as I would use Going Green Limousine EVERY time!
