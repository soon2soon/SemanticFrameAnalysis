Amazing trip they led to the Galapagos Islands.  It was more than I ever expected.  We dove with sea lions, we went on trails with the turtles, snorkled with all the birds.   The cost was really reasonable given the amazing trip.  We didn't have to worry about anything.  Meals were great, service was terrific.  I could never have put any of this together as well myself. They did such a great job, I got fantastic help from them on Uganda and diving in Honduras too. I would recommend them any time!
