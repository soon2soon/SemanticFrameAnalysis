I just read a review that I had to speak out on. I have been on Chicago Trolley Co vehicles several times for pub crawls. 3 times out of the 5 I've been on our driver was HOLLYWOOD let me personally say that guy ROCKS!!! Everytime he went way above and beyond to help us out. From helping us move coolers, letting us use his phone for music, he even pulled over and threw out some drunk a**hole that jumped in the window of our trolley. That guys awesome!!! I know we were out of control but he remained professional the entire night. Hollywood even helped us carry the birthday boy to the lobby of the hotel. If you ever take a Chicago Trolley make sure to ask for HOLLYWOOD!!! HOLLYWOOD!!!! HOLLYWOOD!!!
