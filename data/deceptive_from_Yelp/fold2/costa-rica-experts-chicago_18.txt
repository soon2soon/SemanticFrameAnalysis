After a rough year the team at Costa Rica Experts, (shout out to Aaron), planned the trip I needed. I had no idea where I wanted to go or how I wanted to spend my time. Aaron listened to me and offered various options. His education is vast and he can actually has personally experienced every thing he recommended. I trust him and can't wait till my trip next week. Even if you don't know where you want your big vacation at least talk to Aaron. He wont steer you wrong or sell you things you wouldn't want. The service is very personalized. They DO NOT treat their clients like a number. Aaron is your man,
