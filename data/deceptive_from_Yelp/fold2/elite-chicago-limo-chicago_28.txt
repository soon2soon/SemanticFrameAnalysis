I absolutely loved Elite! The ride was smooth, fun, and the driver was outstanding. We were a pretty loud group and the driver wasn't phased. The party bus was also pristine, the sound system also worked flawlessly. The complimentary water was key that night in the bus and appreciated it. I am definitely going back to Elite whenever I need a limo/bus for an occasion.
