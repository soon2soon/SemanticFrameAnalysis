Georgie was my tour guide as well! I really just went on this tour when I had family in from out of town who wanted to do touristy things. I have no interest in Frank Lloyd Wright but the tour guide made him really interesting, accessible, and knew a shocking amount about this man. Also, he was really cute. What can I say? It kept me more interested. I would definitely go again and if you're looking for FLW I would highly rec. this company.
