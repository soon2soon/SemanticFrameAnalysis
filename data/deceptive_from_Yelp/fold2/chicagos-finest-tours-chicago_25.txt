My husband and I took Chicago's Finest River Walk Tour on August 12th.  As long time Chicagoland residents, we have been on several other tours, but this one was by far the best. Take a tour on one of the boats or buses and you'll hear someone recite facts and figures about the Willis Tower and Hancock Building.  Take Chicago's Finest River Walk Tour and you will be entertained for two full hours with stories ranging from the founding of the City of Chicago to the filming of Transformers III.  Our tour guide, Dan, was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  His passion for the city and its history was evident as he regaled us with anecdotes about many of Chicago's most famous and infamous citizens. I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone looking to spend an extremely entertaining and informative two hours on Chicago's beautiful river front.
