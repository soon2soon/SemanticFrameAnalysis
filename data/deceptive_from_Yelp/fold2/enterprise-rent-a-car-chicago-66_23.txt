We rented a minivan in downtown Chicago.  We had booked it online.  The price was competitive and the staff was excellent at the downtown location and when we dropped the van off at O'Hare.  Knowing that people are trying to catch a flight, the staff at O'Hare was efficient, courteous and helpful.  They even transferred our luggage to the waiting shuttle to take us to the terminal.  We drove almost 3000 miles in 2 weeks and had no problems with the van.  I would highly recommend Enterprise.
