My wife and I took the 3 hour tour this week. We were a little nervous because this was our first segway adventure! It only took about 15 minutes to get the hang of it. Â Our guide, Kelsey, was awesome! She was full of great info and also took lots of pictures for us. I would highly recommend this tour!
