Great customer service and perfect location in Chicago!!  Lots of good restaurants to choose from close by.  Right on the river and not far from the Lake.  We walked everywhere!   The room was quite large and also had a chair to pull into a bed, a fridge, micro and coffee maker w/ cream.  We live in the suburbs and will stay at this hotel when we travel to the city in the future, with or without our 2 boys.
