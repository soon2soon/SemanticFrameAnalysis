We recently took two tours - The Signature Architecture Tour and the Frank Lloyd Wright Chicago Loop Walking Tour.  As a Chicago area resident, I have had quite a number of tours of Chicago, some good and some bad.  Our tour guide, Victoria, did an outstanding job.  She is knowledgeable about the history of so many buildings and had many interesting facts and stories to share.  She is pleasant and friendly and gave us plenty of opportunities to ask questions.  She had excellent answers.  I think our time was well spent and am happy to highly recommend Victoria for any tour of Chicago.
