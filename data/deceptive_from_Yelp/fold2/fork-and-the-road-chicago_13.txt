I saw the intriguing tour, bicyling great Chicago neighborhoods and stopping at unique, authentic places for a bite to eat.  I did the Latin America tour, and everything was great.  Many people in the group were from one of the neighborhoods we went through, and said that they had traveled past the restaurant before, but never knew the delicacies that were available within.  I also wondered how difficult (read scary!) bicycling Chicago streets would be.  Not to worry!  Sharon knew what she was doing, and we all did what Sharon did, so we were fine.  It was empowering cruising through neighborhoods, under expressways, along side streets and major thoroughfares!  The leaders (Sharon and Ben the day I went) were fun, welcoming, reassuring, informative, knowledgable, and perfect for the job.  The only question for me is which tour I'll take next. . . they all sound good!
