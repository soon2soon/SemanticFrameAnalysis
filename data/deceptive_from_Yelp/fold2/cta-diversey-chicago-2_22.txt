Usually decent. Last night, when I was coming back from Yelp Fest, the guy closed the door on me. As it hit me, squooshing me on both sides in a joyfully painful manner, I managed to get out by sqwirming wildly. My girlfriend was still stuck on the train. So I had the privlidge of waiting 15 minutes for her at the Damen stop. When she got back, Mr train man gave us a 1-800 number to complain. Of course the number leads you to an automated labrynth of joy where you will be lost for days (or perhaps weeks) without any human contact. Luckily I gnawed off three fingers and a thumb in order to keep sane. Perminant middle finger for you guys.
