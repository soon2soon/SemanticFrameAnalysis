Horrible experience.   My family is in town today and we were taking the water taxi from Madison to Wacker Drive.  It was raining out and the inside seats were packed.  I evidently was sitting too close to the location on the bench that deck hand Christopher D. wanted to use for his backpack and life jacket.  One minute into the ride he told me I was sitting on the location on the bench he uses for his stuff and threw his life jacket at me.  I immediatly callled the office of the Water Taxi and told them I wanted to file a complaint.  I was told the manager had "stepped away" and would call me back as soon as he returned to the office.  Guess what?  Never heard from the manager.   There are many boat options in Chicago.   Do not use the Water Tax. Worst customer service ever!
