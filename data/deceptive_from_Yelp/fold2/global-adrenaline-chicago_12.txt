Global Adrenaline is a scam operation. They sent me an email saying I had won a free party, I sent them one back to confirm details, "Mark Lang" sent me back an email confirming the date. When my group showed up at the club Enclave for the event, we were not on any list, no one knew anything about it and every boucer was so rude that I was stunned. Â They grudingly said they could let us in but would make us pay $20 !!!! What a joke. The club was skeezy and trashy, I would have only gone there for the free drinks. How can anyone think this is good service?? I will never trust them for anything again. They need to get their act together.
