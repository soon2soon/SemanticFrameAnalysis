The wifey booked this transportation service from Chicago to ORD. Overall pretty decent service...the driver was a friendly gentlemen. I guess I was expecting something a little more luxurious than a ford escape. Kind of misleading to be called a "limousine" service without any luxury vehicles. Anyways, the escape was a hybrid...to be honest it didn't really matter to me, but my wife is on a green kick so that is probably why she got it. Bottom line, if you want a green alternative to a normal taxi service this is probably the way to go. If you want something luxurious like a traditional limousine service look for something else.
