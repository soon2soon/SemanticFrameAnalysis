My power went out due to the recent storms so I thought I would try a few of the motels in the area. I went here after staying at a few down the street.  This one seems more maintained I feel.  They have new airconditioners and tvs.  The price is pretty much the same at the other motels down the street but I think I get more for my money at this one.  The rooms smelled better too. I say do what I did and go check out a few of the motels for yourself.  But from my experience I would choose this one over the others. Thanks
