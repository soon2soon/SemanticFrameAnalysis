I chose this hotel for its location and because it had a microwave and refrigerator (I love to be able to have my own snacks and beverages) but I was amazed when I saw the room! It was huge and nicely decorated! It had a full kitchen including stove, dishes, pots, etc., 3 large closets, and even a washer and dryer! The staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful and the complimentary breakfast was great too, including a hot entree and make your own waffles.
