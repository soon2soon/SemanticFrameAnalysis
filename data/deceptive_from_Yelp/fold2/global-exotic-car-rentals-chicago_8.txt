I am HIGHLY disappointed with their customer service. I tried to give them my hard earned money to rent a vehicle for my wedding day. I wanted to surprise my future wife with a exotic car. I did everything that was asked of me by the website (CC#, Auto Insurance, etc.) 24 hours they will get back with you when you submit a reservation, right? A month and a few days later I have still yet to receive a phone call. I mean if there is something not right or I don't meet the criteria of rental. By all means let me know. Im sure they are not busy with high value of business. If they pride themselves in customer service then they definitely need to go back to the drawing board.
