I am moved to give a High 5 to Chicago's Finest Limosine and Car service. Recently I had a 5:30PM flight to Seattle out of Midway. We had Auditors in our office and was not able to leave my office until 4:20PM. Paul from CFL & C literally took side streets to get me at the Airport in time for my flight. He was awesome. On my return trip he was there to meet me in Baggage Claim. I'm not kidding !! The Service, The treats and the inexpensive price makes this the best kept secret for Executives on the Go. Definite 5 Stars. Jerry Freund
