City Segway Tours is as good as it gets! John is a great guide, and highly recommended. I have been taking a tour group to Chicago for 5 years, and we have always used City Segway Tours and been extremely satisfied. There are cheaper options, but none better. They show you the video of all the ways you can destroy yourself and the machine, and then (with plenty of humor) help you learn to run them. Once you are all comfortable, you are off to a great time. Through Millennium and Grant Parks, pictures at the Buckingham Fountain, and down to Museum Campus, where you can enjoy the BEST Chicago Dog around! Overall, a great tour. They are the ONLY tour in Chicago with the Better Business Bureau and are BY FAR the BEST!
