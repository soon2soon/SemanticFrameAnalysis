We took a private tour for my husband's birthday in February, so I am late to review, but wanted to post this! Gabriel (founder) was so accomodating and gave us the insider's point of view in the industry. It was a fun and laid-back tour filled with delicious beer. We had 15 people with us and every single one enoyed it. Half Acre was generous with the tastings and helped make a great birthday for my husband. Â Thanks!
