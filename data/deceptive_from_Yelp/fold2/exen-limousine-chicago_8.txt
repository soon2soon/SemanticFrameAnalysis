I used Exen Limousine for a very special evening and the service was EXCELLENT and exceeded our expectations!  I work with a large non-profit in Chicago and we needed limo service as part of an auction item for a fundraiser we held.  The auction prize involved an "evening out on the town" with some very prominent people.  We needed service to be reliable and top notch for these very special guests.  The limo arrived on time and the driver/service was extremely accommodating given the itinerary for this special evening.  We couldn't be happier with Exen's service.  We will whole-heartedly recommend them to all of our affiliates and will not hesitate to use their transportation services in the future.  Professional, prompt, courteous and an overall fantastic experience!!!
