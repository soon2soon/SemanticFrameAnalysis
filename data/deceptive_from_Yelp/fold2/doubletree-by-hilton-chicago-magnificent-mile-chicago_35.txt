Do NOT stay at this hotel. I am (was) a loyal Hilton Honors Member, but thinking about switching to another hotel chain after this experience. Our check-in started with the lady behind the desk giving my wife an attitude because she asked for an additional water (they gave 2 and knew there were 4 guests). Then it took over an hour to get our bags brought up... And the guy who brought our bags up blamed the delay on the greeter (saying the greeter had too much going on and shouldn't have taken our bags). Our room, which was on the Hilton Honors floor, was disgusting! Dirty in every room, exposed electrical outlet, both telephones in the room were broken (this might have been on purpose so you couldn't call down and complain). The cleanliness issue was brought to the front desks attention and they are trying to compensate me; however, I shouldn't have these issues in the first place. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Oh, and there are other things but the list is too long! Hopefully we can find another hotel to stay in tomorrow night for the remainder of our trip downtown Chicago.
