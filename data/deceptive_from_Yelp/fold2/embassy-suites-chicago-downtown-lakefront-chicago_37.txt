Had a lovely stay here. Lucked out and got a quiet room in a corner of the building not overlooking noisy atrium. Breakfast wonderful albeit had to wait in line. The breakfast is not a Marriott breakfast but you do get a custom omelette, bacon, melon and pineapple, drinks. Free drinks at Manager's Reception. Atrium is a pleasant place to sit among bamboo. Great location close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. There's a fantastic Spanish restaurant nearby on Ohio St. (Tapas!) My room came with wi-fi due to conference deal but I would be irritated if asked to pay $15 for it.
