This is easily the most comprehensive tour around Chicago! Our tour guide was an extremely pleasant architecture student who really knew her stuff! She gave us, what we felt to be, 'insider info' and kept it interesting and made sure to build a rapport with everyone in the group. This tour really gave me a feel for the beautiful city of Chicago, and the history surrounding the buildings, parks, and roadways. I would highly recommend this, The Signature Architecture Tour, to anyone visiting this great american city.
