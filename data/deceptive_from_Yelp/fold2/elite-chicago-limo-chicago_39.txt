Because my first time with Elite was so awesome, I decided to book them again to drive us from Chicago to Joliet for Electric Daisy Carnival for 3 days. The bus was awesome, sound system was excellent, and the driver very understanding and hilarious. He was willing to take breaks when we needed a bathroom and was dancing along with us. HAROLD IS THE BEST! Driving was smooth, especially with stop & go traffic in Chicago and highway driving. Driver was on time and willing to work with us on pick up & drop off times, whatever we wanted. They included cups and some drinks for us on the bus, which was a bonus. Great customer service when I called in and reserved the bus too! Overall, very professional and classy company. Definitely my go-to place for limos/party buses!
