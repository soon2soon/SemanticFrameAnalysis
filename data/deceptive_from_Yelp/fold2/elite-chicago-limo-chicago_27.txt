Used them this past weekend for my husband's 30th birthday downtown.  Fantastic service!  They were on time and were very nice when some of my guests weren't feeling well on the way home...including me!  They even upgraded us from a hummer limo to the Limo Bus, what an awesome experience!  Definitely recommend and will use them in the future! :)
