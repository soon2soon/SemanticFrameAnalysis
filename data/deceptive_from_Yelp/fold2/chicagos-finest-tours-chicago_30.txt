I have been living in Chicago for well over 2 decades and I decided just for fun to sign up for the brunch tour. I had very little expectations but I was excited. I ordered my ticket on the site and received a confirmation email with all the information as to time, date and location. I arrived to the Radisson Blu Hotel and got enjoyed some great coffee as I admired the amazing interior of the lobby and seating area the group was gathering in. Dan was the tour guide and he really lifted the mood of the entire group. I am not a morning person but once he began to talk and the excitement in his voice really woke up the entire group. I felt as if now we were all as a group excited for this tour! We started out in the hotel and proceeded into the Pedway system. Now I have never been in the pedway system. I had known a little about it but had no idea how vast the system was. Throughout the tour we stayed the entire time in the tunnel system where the aw and amazement seemed to sprout every corner we turned. But it wasn't just the views or the history that was coupled - Dan made the entire aspect interactive. He would ask us questions every once in a while and the winner would get a small gift card. It was a great way to keep our attention going and a lot of fun to explore the city in a completely different way. We ended up at Macy's and I have been there dozens of times - but how many people would have known that the ceiling in the middle is a true masterpiece? Would have never known! I think this tour is perfect for company outings in the city as well as locals and out-of-towners. The price is more than affordable - plus this tour had food included and we even got to try some amazing popcorn towards the end of the tour. Overall great experience and I urge everyone to try this. Lastly the brunch tour seems like the perfect start to try as the first tour and then they have a lot more others you can try. I am going to check out their Chicago History tour next!
