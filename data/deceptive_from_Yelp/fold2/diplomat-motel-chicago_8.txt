I searched for quite a while for a hotel in Chicago that wasn't too far from everything but still affordable. This hotel definitely fit the bill. It has free parking, which is a huge bonus. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was small, but that wasn't really a problem since I was only using it for sleep. I would definitely stay here again.
