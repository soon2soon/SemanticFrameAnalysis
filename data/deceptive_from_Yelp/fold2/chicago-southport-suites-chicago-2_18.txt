Wow what a great place for a family reunion. We were all so comfortable, I loved the big cushy living room. We made great use of the kitchen and breakfast area. We took a walk around the neighborhood every day and the L was are main mode of transportation. Lots of shops and restaurants and the grocery store a couple of blocks away had everything you could need.
