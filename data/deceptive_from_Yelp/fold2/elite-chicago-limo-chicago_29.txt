Rented a 32 passenger party bus from Chicago to Wisconsin Dells.  For an $850 round trip, it was a lot less than what we paid for the same trip last year and the bus and the experience were about 10 times better.  The bus had extra space for our luggage and enough cooler space to fit about 5 cases and all of the hard liquor we had brought on-board.   It was the smoothest and most chill ride my friends and I ever had.  Elite's drivers act less like your typical bus driver  and more like a professional party host.  Loved every minute of the experience, would definitely recommend them to anyone.
