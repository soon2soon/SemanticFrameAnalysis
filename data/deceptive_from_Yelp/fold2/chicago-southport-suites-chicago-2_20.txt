I am a repeat customer. This our destination every time we come to Chicago. The accommodations are perfect and working with Jim Flanders is such an ease. Just a short walk to the El gets you anywhere you want to go in the city, and you come home to a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shopping. Recommend to anyone visiting the Chicago area.
