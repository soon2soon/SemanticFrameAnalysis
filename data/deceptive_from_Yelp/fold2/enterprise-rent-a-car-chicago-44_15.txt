The worst car rental experience yet! Never using Enterprise again.  Rented a car to go to Gary, Indiana in July.  The Enterprise rep at the pre-inspection was sloppy:  he missed a couple of scratches on the car, which I had to point out to him.  Never even thought to look at the roof.  Well, lo and behold  when I returned the car, the first place they look is on the roof, and there is a dent there, which they claim was caused by hail!!  Really?? In the middle of the summer drought ???  Tried to take this up with the rep and the manager, but no-one would listen to me.  Now I have been charged for the damage!  I was treated very poorly, and I'm NEVER using Eneterprise again.
