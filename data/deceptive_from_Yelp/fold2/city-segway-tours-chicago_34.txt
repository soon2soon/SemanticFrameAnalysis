Today we took our third tour with City Segway Tours and had just as much fun as we did the first time. Today Grandma and Grandpa tested their "Seglegs" for the first time. Our tour guide was Chris told us from the beginning that he was green but he was full of trivia and historical fact about the city and was exceptionally patient, even with a group as diverse in experience as ours. Thank you Chris!
