I took the FLW Interiors tour and it was fantastic! I found our guide to be exceptionally knowledgeable about the subject and found that he had a vast wealth of knowledge in related subjects as well as dates and significant figures. I want to tour many other sites in Chicago and I would certainly go through Chicago Savvy in the future.
