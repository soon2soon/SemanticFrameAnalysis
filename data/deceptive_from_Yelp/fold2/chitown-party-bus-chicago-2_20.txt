This was the best party bus service! Everyone had a great time and Kevin (the diver) was the best! I'm a bit of a worrier but could tell upon arrival that everything would go smoothly. Â The bus arrived right on time and was supplied with cups, ice and the music was already going. Kevin was very accommodating and was easy to reach whenever we were ready to move on to the next place. I highly recommend this company!
