So this might be a (more than slightly) skewed review, but I wanted to share.  Not only is the beer fantastic, local and super fresh, but the staff is just kick ass.  I rode my bike on this beautiful Sunday out to get a couple growlers and got a flat just two blocks from Half Acre.  I had a patch kit, but no pump (some ass stole it).   The guys in Half Acre came thru for a fellow cyclist with a sweet air pump loaner as well as a couple of growlers (1 Over Ale, 1 Daisy Cutter).  I'm enjoying an Over Ale as I type and couldn't be happier.   This sort of thing is what makes"local" matter.  I'm hardly a regular, I'm not someone these guys know.  But they stepped up and helped a brother out.   Kudos to Half Acre and their staff.
