A truly phenomenal captain, staff, and boat. We had a special situation in which we needed to ask a favor for our wedding, and they went above and beyond in making it possible last night. We couldn't have asked for more! Everyone was very warm and friendly. The cruise itself was beautiful as well - much more comprehensive than a similar one by another company we had taken last year. We are anxious to go on another one of their cruises after the wedding!
