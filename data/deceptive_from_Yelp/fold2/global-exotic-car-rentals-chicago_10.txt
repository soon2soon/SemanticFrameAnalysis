Wow what fun to drive an exotic on a race track in Phoenix. Beautiful cars are great to look at but even more fun to drive yourself on a race track as fast as you can go. Charley the owner says he will be doing it in Chicago this summer. Thank you Charley and Walid for a fantastic experience and I will be there at the track in Chicago this summer. Pratty
