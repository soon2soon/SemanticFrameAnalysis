I stayed at hotel 7 months ago. Stay was excellent. Check this out: I though I loss a expense projector. Darrin Vesotsky | Director of Safety & Security at the hotel took time to track me down and get me back the projector that left at hotel by accident. He found a business card track down friend of mine got me back my equipment. This hotel is great !!!! We plan to take our grand children there this summer. While there and now having Darrin go above beyond, I can say this hotel has best service and employees of any hotel I have stayed in.
