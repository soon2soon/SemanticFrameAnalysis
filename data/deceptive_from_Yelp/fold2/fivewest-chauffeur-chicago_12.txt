I hired Fivewest Chauffeur for a big alumni fundraiser I had in Chicago - I was in charge of the transportation of our special guests to and from the event, and I could not have been more pleased with Ryan and his services. He was extremely professional in both the day-of services and our communications leading up to my event. I also appreciated his text messages throughout the night to keep me updated on his arrival time, etc. We rode in the 10-person Mercedes limo bus, which was impeccably clean and modern. He made our distinguished guests feel very well taken care of which ensured a successful evening for everyone (including myself!) and reflected well on our event overall. I will definitely be calling Ryan again next year for our event and for any other chauffeuring services I need.
