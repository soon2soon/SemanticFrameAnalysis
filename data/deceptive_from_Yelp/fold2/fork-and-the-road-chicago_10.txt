What a great way to see the city and eat delicious foods in Chicago!   Dimitra is an excellent tour guide on the street and at the restaurants; she knows her routes and she definetly knows her food!   I been fortunate to take at least one tour per summer for the last three years; and I am always fascinated by the places and the people that I met.  This summer I had the opportunity to take the Curre-ious Tour - we tried Chicago's finest sausages, pates, and cured and smoked meats; and got the opportunity to be behind-the-scenes looking at curing rooms and kitchens.  It was just AMAZING! Fork and the Road truly offers enjoyable and unique tours to experience GREAT places in Chicago!  Looking forward to next summer!
