My wife and I stayed here for a Saturday night during a weekend get-away from the 'burbs. I found it on Priceline for $89 bucks, and given the amenities such as the WIFI it is well worth the price. The rooms are tiny but clean. I would recommend it for a night in the city or a business trip, but I don't think I could take an extended stay. Also given the price, you are going to run into some rif-raf, but our floor was very quiet.
