The Four Seasons has always been one of my favorites, so naturally when I visited Chicago I immediately looked for a Four Seasons. Luckily enough, I arrived during the week, so I was able to get a room without a problem. Spacious, clean, elegant, with phenomenal service, excellent food... what more could you ask for in a high-end hotel? The staff was extremely helpful when I was searching for a few things to pass my second day, and I even decided to stay a third day simply to enjoy the room and the city's attractions for just a little longer. All in all, I had a perfect experience, and know exactly where I'll be staying when I visit Chicago again.
