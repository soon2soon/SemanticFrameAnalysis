I have set up special events for conferences for 20+ years and this was one of the best we've ever had. The food (via Entertaining Company) was fabulous, the cruise and drink package was easy on the budget and the staff was the most attentive I have ever experienced. We did a late October evening cruise and it was beautiful and unusually balmy. Our docent on this architectural cruise taught us all so much AND we still had time to network. I can't recommend this enough.
