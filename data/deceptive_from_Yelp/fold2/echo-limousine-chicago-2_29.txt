I arranged service through Echo Limo ahead of a business trip to Chicago.  Online booking and communications were convenient and established a good initial impression.  Upon arrival in Chicago, I had a communication, text, from the driver providing pick up location and contact info.  Notified the driver of my location and he arrived in 5-8 mins at curbside.  Drive in to the city was comfortable, water was available for my enjoyment and the driver handled my luggage with respect.  Excellent experience and I will be a repeat customer on any subsequent trips to the area.
