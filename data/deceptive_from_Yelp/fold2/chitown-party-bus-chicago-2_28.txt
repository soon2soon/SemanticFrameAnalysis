Hosted my B-day Party @ the Baton Club this year and used ChiTown PartyBus for Transportation.  We used the smaller bus, there were 14 of us and it was PERFECT!  Bus was clean and the seating made it easy to see and talk with all of my guests. Plus plenty of room to move arround (pole dancing).  Sound system on the bus is fantastic.  Driver was courteous and helped each of my guest on and off the bus which as the night went on became essential for safety ;)  Tons of cooler space and shelf for cups & bottles. The only thing this bus is missing is Cup Holders, lol I will definitely use and recommend ChiTown PartyBus again!
