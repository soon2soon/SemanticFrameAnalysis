Loved the brunch tour with Rick!  A friend from New York recommended this tour to us - and we are Chicagoans!   We have never enjoyed a tour so much, and we have done the boats and the Detour walking tour -this one outshined them all.  We went on an July Saturday and learned so much about Chicago, and we loved the way Rick shared the facts and trivia in cool stories about the city and her history.  We walked for about 1/2 hour and had brunch at 12:30 - the perfect time for a traditional brunch and really loved the omeletes at Cyranos (they knew Rick right away when we got there and gave us special treatment) right on the river where Rick shared more stories and the people watching was fantastic along the river!   My husband is a local and "thought he knew it all," but was flabergasted at all the new things he learned. There were 8 other people on the tour with us and we felt like family by the end- we are planning to do the Night Lights tour next and see the River and City at night.  We tend not to be big tippers - but we were in Rick's case.  I give it a five out of five stars.
