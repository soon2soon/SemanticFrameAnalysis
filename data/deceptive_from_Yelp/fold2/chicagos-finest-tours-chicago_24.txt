Visiting from Knoxville, TN and we were so impressed! Great value, we expected a higher fee for this type of tour in a big city - go before prices are raised!  I can't imagine anyone knowing more about this city than our tour guide.  We really enjoyed ourselves and love the city of Chicago.  In year's past we have done the bus tours and this beat them by far.  I highly recommend this tour.
