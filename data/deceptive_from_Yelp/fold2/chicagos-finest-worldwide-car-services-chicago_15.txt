I seldom write reviews however I felt so insulted after my encounter that I decided to  take time to help others.  I attempted to use two expired groupons for  round trip travel to O'Hare airport.  I was aware that I would receive face value for my groupons (130.00) instead of receiving two round-trip rides for up to three people. I didn't have a problem with the fact that I might have to add a little money along with the vouchers to make one round trip for two people. The first person I spoke with admitted that he was new and unsure of the process of using expired groupons and he ended up calling me back perhaps 6 or 7 times to arrange the transportation, this was a little trying but he was quite pleasant and polite-that wasn't the problem.  It was when his "boss" called me back the real trouble started,  He would not allow me to tell him what type of groupon voucher I had and insisted on telling me what type of groupon I had.  When I spoke loudly and told him to listen to what I was saying and told him which groupon I had he replied he didn't know.  Once he realized I had two round trip vouchers valued at 130.00 total he then said I couldn't use them for the same trip (even though this wasn't written anywhere in the fine print).  I then told him to cancel my reservation and notified groupon and received a full refund for the face value of the coupon.  Poor horrible customer service!!      Would not recommend them to anyone.
