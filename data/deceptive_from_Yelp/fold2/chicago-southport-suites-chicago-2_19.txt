My sister's and I rented this property for a long girls weekend to celebrate my mothers birthday.  The place is beautiful and extremely comfortable.  We had a couple minor issues (trying to figure out the thermostat and I-pod docking station), and both owners came immediately to help us out.  They even sent a beautiful bouquet of flowers to wish my mom a happy birthday and apologize for the minor issues. The location is great!  There are some great places to eat and shop within 2 blocks.  The train station is 1 block away, so we could easily go downtown.  We can't wait to come back!  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a home away from home!
