I highly recommend Exen Limousine. I'm from Atlanta and came to Chi to meet up with some friends and go to the Falcons/Bears game last week. My friends met me at my hotel and the limo was right on time. The driver was professional, courteous, and the price was right. After the game the driver took us to a few bars and afterwards we returned to the hotel. I've used other limo services before and not been as happy as I was with Exen!
