I stayed here this weekend as part of a very large group. Free coffee, free parking, super friendly staff. Rooms are clean and beds are soft. They put up with a huge, wild group of friends who took over the whole motel. Rates are so good for a place in the middle of a big city. Would definitely come back if I get the chance! Thanks Diplomat Motel.
