My husband and I went on the three o'clock tour last Thursday with Dan and two moms with their children. Kudos to all. Dan enthusiastically engaged everyone. Not one whine from any child or adult. He asked questions and encouraged all to participate. Two hours passed quickly and we all learned more about Chicago. It was a beautiful day for a walk by the river and it was a pleasure to spend time with two families that encourage learning and enjoyed spending time together.
