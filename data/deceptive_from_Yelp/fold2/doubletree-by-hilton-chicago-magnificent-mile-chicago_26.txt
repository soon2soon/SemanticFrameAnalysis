Location is fantastic for shopping and sightseeing. Rooms are nice, but the additional charges for in-room coffee, internet, etc seems unnecessary.  The staff was very professional and accommodating. Norma was one of the friendliest most patient and helpful desk assistants I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  The garage spaces are way too small.  Our car was significantly scratched and bumped by the adjacent vehicles.  I would recommend parking in another facility, or the hotel should consider reducing the each row of parking by 1 car space to allow the additional six to twelve inches to be added to other parking space.
