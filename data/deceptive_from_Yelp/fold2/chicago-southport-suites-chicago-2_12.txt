This was a fantastic condo! We were in the heart of Southport Ave, which is an excellent mix of families, parks, restaurants, boutiques, and only 2 blocks from the red line. The free garage parking spot is one of the best perks, as this will cost easily $50/day at a hotel- plus there are no worries about parking tickets. The condo itself is perfect for families. The kitchen is well stocked, cable and wi-fi are included, and the in-condo laundry make our stay a bit easier. With or without kids, this place is perfect. With kids (we have two age 3 and under), its even better!
