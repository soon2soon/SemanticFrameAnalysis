I've never written a review but there's a first time for everything! I stood at this hotel with my boyfriend last week. The rooms were small, but who cares we were out most of the time. I'm not sure if this goes for every floor but I was on the 12th and there was unlimited filtered water! I loved that! Anyway, when ever we'd be back at our room it was spotless. They were cleaned and you can tell the maid did a great job because we were a bit messy. :) It was as if we were never there and I appreciate that kind of service. I will be returning thank you club quarters!
