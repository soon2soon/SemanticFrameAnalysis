Great tour! As other's have said, you get to enjoy 3 pints of fresh brewed Half Acre beer, many of which are only available at the brewery. The staff was funny and knowledgable and seemed like they were having as much fun as we were. I ABSOLUTELY recommend a trip to Half Acre! Side note: later in the day we went to Revolution Brewery for a tour - SKIP IT. While it's free, you only get to sample 1 can of beer, its around 40 minutes long, and the staff are not anywhere near as fun as Half Acre.
