I started planning a big group outing to a Cubs game for this past Friday, back in January.  After the company I'd dealt with for past trips jumped rates on me, I solicited numerous companies for my group this year. Not only was ChiTown Party Bus extremely competitive with it's pricing, I found that Chris V was very responsive to all my questions in preparing for my outing.  (Being an analyst for my job, it's in my nature to ask a zillion questions.)   In the week leading into my event, I sent another flury of questions and again, Chris responded promptly and readily adapted to my request since with ChiTown's fleet and relationships he could handle that adjustment.  (Thanks again Chris for that flexibility. I understand that's not always going to be possible.) Day of communication was great as well.  Text messages arrived ahead of time letting me know they were running on time and pinpointing the exact pickup location in Wrigleyville for our return trip.   My group of about 60 traveled using both the Big Daddy and a Triple-D.  Both vehicles were in great shape. Friday rush hour traffic on the Eisenhower has never been so much fun!
