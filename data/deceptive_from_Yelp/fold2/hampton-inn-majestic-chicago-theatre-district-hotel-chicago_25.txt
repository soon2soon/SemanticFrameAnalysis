Our family never experienced customer service like we havein the last 24 hours.  Christine, the GM-Tina her assistant GM and RENE were the kindest people in Chicago today!  My boys went to get personal belongings from my daughters car after an accident.  The day became a nightmare with the paperwork and so on.  The boys "splurged" and decided to stay in Chicago.  The next morning the parking garage they had used-they could not find!   The boys looked for the garage all day today. In desperation I called the hotel, and they knew of the boys problem.  They comped the room, a military and general courtsey gesture-fed my boys pizza and sent the valet Rene out in his personal car to find the parking garage.  RENE, you are my hero!!   If their gestures were this kind and sincere to two 21 year old boys who were frustrated and I am sure did not have good mannors at that point can you imagine how great they make all their guests feel?? Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
