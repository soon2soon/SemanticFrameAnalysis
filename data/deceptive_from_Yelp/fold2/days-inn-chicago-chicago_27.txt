This place is a 5-10 minute walk from Chicago avenue. So the shops, the restaurants, the park and the beach is walking distance. The Hotel was clean, the the staff were helpful, and it has free parking. Its also right next to a famous McDonalds which is open 24 hours a day which is extremely helpful when you have the late night munchies after a walk to the beach.
