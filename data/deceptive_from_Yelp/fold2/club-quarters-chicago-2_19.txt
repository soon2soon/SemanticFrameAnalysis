I let my companion "hotwire" a room - what a mistake!  $200/night to sleep in a twin bed?  You have got to be kidding.  I have never even SEEN twin beds in a hotel before - it was like being in a 1950's sit-com.  When we tried to check in, the attendant insisted we use the kiosk - which of course did not work, so she had to check us in anyway.  There are other hotels in the vicinity which have two double beds per room...and likely for cheaper!  Do not stay here!
