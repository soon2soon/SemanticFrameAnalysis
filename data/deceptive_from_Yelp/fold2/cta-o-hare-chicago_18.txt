I'm not sure what train some of the these writers took, but Ohare Blue line is a dump. The train stinks, it's dirty the seats with cloth.. Cloth really? are either urine stains or vomit from the numerous Homeless people that make the train home. The stations are often dirty with trash all around. I have made numerous complaints to CTA to clean this mess up but nothing is done. I call on all riders to to take pictures and post them to social media, Go to Ohare Airport evening hours into early morning and I promise you what you see will make you sick. So many homeless people and I'm sorry but there are shelters! Chicago Tourist come to the city and first thing they get is a view and smell of this.
