Beauty is as beauty does.  While the decor and ambiance is seductive,  the services is unacceptable.   During my second stay, the bell staff neglected to load all of my belongings in my SUV, one of which was a dress for a formal dance.  When I called the front desk, they apologized, sent the dress by Federal Express, and held my other things (purchases from Perchance) until my arrival a week later.  Everyone makes mistakes--so I tried it again.  Upon registration, I was shown to a suite (which I had originally booked and then downgraded because my plans had changed and I was traveling alone).  I though they had upgraded my room to make amends for the prior mistake.  I had a delivery that needed to be made two blocks away and so I called the concierge.  I was advised that they could handle the delivery and the package was picked up at my room.  As i was checking out, I realized that I had been charged the full amount for the suite--the change to my reservation had never been made.    I left the hotel,  only to be called and advised by a staff member of  the hotel that the Elysian did not have the staff available to make my delivery and if I needed a service to handle the matter that they would be happy to arrange it at my expense.  (The ladies from Perchance handled the delivery for me.)  Upon returning home, I realized that I was missing an expensive leather jacket.  When I called the hotel, I was advised that nothing matching the description had been found or turned in by staff.  An email to the GM went unanswered.  A call the the hotel revealed that the GM was no longer with the hotel and when I was transferred to the Operations Manager, his voice mail said he would be out of the office until November 10.  It was November the 21.  I have since sent an email to the CEO.  No answer from that either.  I am less than impressed.  I had better service at a recent stay at the Doubletree.
