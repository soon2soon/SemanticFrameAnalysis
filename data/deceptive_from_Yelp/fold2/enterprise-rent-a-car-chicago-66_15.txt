Jack Taylor, founder of Enterprise, should be ashamed of the consistently low-brow, uncivil, unprofessional, vulgar and ugly total customer experience that his company provides.  If I could rate with negative stars this company, I would.  This company hides all contact information except for a customer service number that funnels all calls and complaints to poorly trained, vicious agents.  If ever an industry, such as the rental car business, was ready for entrepreneurial companies, such as the ones harnessing personal vehicles to provide taxi-service to consumers, and carve out a significant market share, revenue and profit from undeserving, low value, poorly managed companies (as reflected in the abysmal total customer experience) it is Enterprise. I WILL  NEVER RENT FROM THIS VULGAR, LOW-BROW ORGANIZATION AGAIN Jack Taylor you should be ashamed of yourself and your company.
