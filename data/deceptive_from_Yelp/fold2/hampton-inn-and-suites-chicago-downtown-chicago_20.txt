First, the ok part. Pleasant clean room. That's it. Breakfast is average and the environment for breakfast is awful. Reason? Guests coming to eat the breakfast in their pajamas. It is disgusting to have to watch this. Complained to the front desk, told that as long as they wear shoes its ok. Whaaaaaat? I sleep in my pajamas; I don't go to a restaurant and eat wearing them. I guess you could hang out in the lobby all day wearing your PJs doing whatever you wish. The response to my complaint was ridiculous. Customer service at the front desk is obviously under par. We skipped breakfast for the rest of the stay. I will NEVER stay there again.
