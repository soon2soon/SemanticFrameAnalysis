Fork and the Road...... What a very cool, unique concept & way to experience 1 of the best cities in the world. Sharon & Dimitra combine their awesome knowledge of foods-restaurants-chefs-eclectic places & historic neighborhoods in the city w/ a love of biking to host you on a truly awesome unique experience. Their business provides:  a singular opportunity to enjoy great unique food varieties & establishments that are committed to Green locally grown sources, an up close & personal way to experience the city/different neighborhoods, & a perfect way to combine it all w/ an active outside way for exercise. They are very focused on safety above all else to ensure your experience is fun, safe & comfortable. Our experience was the Vegeterian ride on Sat 6/27 & 22 miles long starting @ the Green City Farmers Market (Lincoln & Wells), to Mana in Westown/Ukranian Village, & to the Mason Street Cheese Store in Oak Park.  I am active & exercise regularly . However, even if you're not so active  the length of the trip on this venue was reasonable because it's broken up w/ the stops. They do other venues w/ different distances & food types. You provide your own bike or rent 1 down there. We came in from Burr Ridge & Algonquin & have bikes. But for simplicity sake we rented bikes @ Bike & Roll @ North Ave Beach. We parked there. I/we are always looking for unique, cool things to do off the beaten path & this is it...up close 1st hand experience of the best city in the world...unique foods-establishments....outdoor activity & exercise..all presented by charming, knowledegable, confident safety minded hosts in Sharon & Dimitra who make this an enjoyable memorable experience..... My recommendation is contact them below NOW, before the word's out & the wait to book is too long...you won't forget this experience & will want to re book on other venues as we likely will !
