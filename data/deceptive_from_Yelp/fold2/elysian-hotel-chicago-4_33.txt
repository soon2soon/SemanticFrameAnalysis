I love this place. I have been reading up the reviews and had to experience it myself and turns out all the rave reviews are true. Amazing service and rooms are one of the nicest hotels I've stayed (I have stayed at many leading hotels of the world). The management goes out of the way to make sure that guests have the most pleasurable experience. No tipping is a nice touch and everyone is very attentive. You have to try it yourself to believe it!
