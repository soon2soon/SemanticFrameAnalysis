We loved everything about our weekend stay!  We were in Chicago for the Marathon and loved being close enough to downtown but out far enough to enjoy some breathing room!  The train was steps away which made transportation extremely convenient.  The neighborhood was lovely with a family friendly atmosphere, delicious eating, and enjoyable nightlife.  The inside of the suite offered it all!  Comfort and elegance.  I have been telling my friends and family that Southport Suites is the place to stay when visiting Chicago.  I can't wait to go back!
