Amazing. To date, I've never stayed in a more beautiful hotel, nor been made to feel more comfortable or at home. I work online, so the free wifi was a must-have, and I stayed in the spacious tub for about an hour at least. Between that, the complementary champagne, and the no tipping policy (a nice touch to get the staff to be consistently amazing), I would highly recommend the Elysian to anyone who wants to get away for a weekend! I had an amazing and wonderful experience here, and will be back to enjoy future stays. This hotel definitely has the wow-factor!
