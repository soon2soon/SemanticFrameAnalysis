Fabulous trip through South Africa!  Highly recommend Global Adrenaline for any and all travel plans.  The company showed great attention to detail which allowed me to relax and enjoy the experience without worrying about the logistics of flights, luggage, tipping, entrance fees, etc.  The choices for the itinerary, hotels, and restaurants were all of high quality and delightful - and at a most reasonable cost. Very grateful for such a special, memorable experience.  Could never have done it without their knowledegable and most courteous assistance, every step of the way.
