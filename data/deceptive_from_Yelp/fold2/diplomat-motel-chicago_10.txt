Location of this hotel is the best and you do not need a car by staying here. Everything is at your fingertips from a walk along the beach to shopping on the Magnificent Mile. Renovations have paid off to make the rooms updated. Comfy bed! If you go during the holiday season, the decorations are lovely and traditional. Service is outstanding and the housekeeping staff did a superb job each day of my stay.
