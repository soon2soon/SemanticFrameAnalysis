My family and I had a wonderful thanksgiving at the Chicago Southport Suites --we are from southern california and were visiting my sister in Irving Park and she lent us her 2nd car.  We got to enjoy family time as well as have down time in coffee shops in the area.  we went to the art institute on the brown line almost across the street and walked to whole foods and the ymca.  The place was comfortable and cosy for us and our daughter.  We liked being in a neighborhood that gave us the flavor of chicago.
