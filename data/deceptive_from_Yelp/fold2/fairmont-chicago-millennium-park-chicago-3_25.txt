Started on the computer looking for reasonable room Fairmont was cheaper than some of the others such as Peninsula, Ritz Carlton, and St. James.  There were also many more rooms.  Upon arrival room was pretty tiny for 379.00  Asked at front desk for upgrade- on my online reservation letter it stated upgrades to suites cost 21$  we didn't arrive until 5:00 so I doubt there would be a big run on rooms-- receptionist said no, it would cost 75$ to upgrade- told her it was 20th anniversary-- which it was but no special treatment.  As for the suite itself- I have never seen such cheap couches and dirty carpets, frayed. bugs on floor.  Aria restaurant was another story--wonderful treatment- chef came out twice to talk to us, sent us free appetizers, champagne and desserts for our anniversary everyone was so nice..  This was best part of our experience   The next morning the coffee machine was broken-ordered one breakfast but since I asked for an extra plate I was charged 50.00 .  Next time I will spend the 500.00 and get a more elegant experience at one of the other hotels.
