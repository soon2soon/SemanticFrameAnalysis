I set-up airport transportation with Going Green for a recent business trip and was highly disappointed. This company is supposed to be a limousine service, but they picked us up in small SUV  which would be best described as described as "a glorified taxi". Limousine by definition is a large (and luxurious) car driven by a chauffeur  They should really call them selves Going Green Taxi.
