This is in my top 5 Washington area hotels. It's in a beautiful old building and we ended up with a pretty great view of the city. This last time, I had my whole crew. My husband, daughter, son-in-law, and my youngest son who turned 4 on this particular trip were all along. I reserved us all a special room, and I felt that they gave me one of their deluxe rooms. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They sent up a cake to celebrate our youngest who just turned 4.. The only con that comes to mind is a couple of times it took reminder calls to housekeeping to get assorted things. I will definitely be a return customer here!
