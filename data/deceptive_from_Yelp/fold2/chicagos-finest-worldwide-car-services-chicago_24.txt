This is the BEST LIMO SERVICE I've ever got since I came to the US 8 years ago. The pick up is on-time, the drivers are very kind and understanding. The person who drove me back and forth to and from O'Hare was David. I had to meet him at 3 AM for my flight at 5 AM, and I wasn't able to wake up on time but he waited for me for 10 minutes. You know, at 3 AM there are not enough cabs around to catch and without his understanding I could have totally missed my flight. Additionally, they had two bottle of water ready in the back seat, which was very refreshing as I literally shot out of my bed that early in the morning. My ride to O'Hare was smooth only thanks to Chicago's Finest Limousine. The way back home was also very comfortable. Same great person came out to pick me up at the airport. My flight was delayed and I am sure they had to wait for me again. It was also getting late, I remember it must have been past mid-night. I was a little nervous as it was getting to late, but he was right there waiting for me. Limousines are not allowed to wait on the curb side, so I had to call him as I went out of the airport, but it didn't even take 2 minutes for him to show up right in front of me. I used Groupon for them, and as they were oversold they were stormed with customer calls and pick-up request. In the middle of that turmoil, they were able to pick me up and drive to my destinations safely and professionally. I respect their dedication. Again, great service, great, kind, understanding drivers who are dedicated to deliver the best service possible. I really can't think of any better words that would describe the quality of service I got from Chicago's Finest Limousine. Thank you so much!
