This was the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel in my life. I booked this hotel on hotels.com and needed to make a change in my reservation. When I contacted both the hotel and the website they ran me in circles and didn't help with my needs at all. Upon check-in, the staff was extremely rude. The hotel was not only overpriced and stuffy, our room was the size of a walk-in closet. When we asked for extra towels and pillows, the staff was again extremely rude. I have never been so unhappy with a hotel stay in my entire life, and especially at the outrages prices they want you to pay. I will NEVER again stay at a Club Quarters hotel ever.
