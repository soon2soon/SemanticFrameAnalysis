I highly recommend this tour.  I did it while I was in Chicago for the weekend.  The guide called herself a docent because she has studied a great deal about architecture and history so that she can give the best tour possible, and she did just that.  I learned a ton about the city's history and she pointed out all of the main attractions, as well as some other unique buildings and Chicago quirks.  She also informed us about basic architectural principles that I did not know before taking the tour.  It was raining for a good deal of our tour, but the guide was so engaging and encouraging that most of us stayed upstairs in our ponchos with her, despite the weather.  Definitely look into this tour when you are in town!
