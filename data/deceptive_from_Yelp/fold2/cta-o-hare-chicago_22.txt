One of the nicest, cleanest airports i've ever been to. Â The transit system is fantastic. Always on time, always clean, and always gets you where you need to go. if u get lost, you are dumb because there are maps at every station and they even announce where you are on the train. people just bitch about it because they are in a rush and no paying any attention. besides being self explanatory, there are station attendants at just about every stop on the train...so if you get lost in that huge airport, you're dumb
