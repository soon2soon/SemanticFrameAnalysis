Really enjoyed our weekend stay here. They have a great band in the lobby bar on Sat. night get there early it was fun. The location is good with a nice view of the lake, walking distance to great restaurants and all the MI shopping, Older hotel which is beautiful and glamorous - the bathrooms have been renovated and the pillows were awesome.
