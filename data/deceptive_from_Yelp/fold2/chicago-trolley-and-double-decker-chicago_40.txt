This attraction is amazing.  Last week I took my Family down to Chicago because my young ones have never been.  I had always  heard that city tours are the ideal way to visit the city.  I did a little researching and found the true local expert. Let me tell you folks this company  is professional.  I love how we had the option of taking either a double decker or the trolley.  I lenjoyed the double decker and the kids were in love with the old fashioned trolleys. We rode both all day  hopping on and off.  I was concerned with how difficult it would be to get my youngest who must use a wheelchair on the tour.  Fortunatley the trolley driver was able to accomadate us in the most kind and professional way. Customer service at its finest!!!!!  This tour is a must do.  The guides are very knowledgeable and funny.  Vacations are great when using the right tools.  Thankfuly The Chicago Trolley company had what we were hoping for!!
