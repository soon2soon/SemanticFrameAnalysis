I highly recommend taking a boat tour to see the Chicago skyline, especially at night.  But, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LINE.  There are plenty of others to chose from.  Why?   On 7/21/2011, when we took this tour, after lining up early along with several other people, we waited for 20 mins to begging boarding at 7:15.  At 7:30, the time of departure, there was no boat in sight.  We waited in the sweltering heat, WITH NO WORD FOR THE REASON OF THE DELAY.  But the DELAY was made that much more MISERABLE because for this line you have to WAIT in an area full of HORSEFLIES that WILL BITE YOU.   As miserable as we were, I felt worse for the OLDER people and KIDS being subjected to this.  Unbelievably, when someone went to ask how much longer the boat would be, they were told that they had no communication with the boat.  Imagine that in this day and age? 20 mins after scheduled departure, boat arrived, docked,& disembarked, it wasn't till about 8:00 when we finally boarded.  Everyone's enthusiasm diminished, there was never any mention of the delay by staff.  One thing I observed while waiting was several boats of other lines passing by.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND NIGHT TOUR, BUT, NOT ON THIS LINE!
