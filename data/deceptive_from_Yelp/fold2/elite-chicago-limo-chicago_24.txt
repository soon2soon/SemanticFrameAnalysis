I used them for a night out on the town with friends who i only get to see a couple times a year. We rented their party bus, and it made for an AMAZING night. Bus was very clean, beautifully decorated, had a great sound system with TV, and had PLENTY of room for the almost 20 people we had. Very well priced too. Driver was very friendly and even showed up about 20 minutes early! We changed our plans multiple times but the driver was very flexible about changing routes and picking up/dropping off people at multiple locations. GREAT company, everyone should use
