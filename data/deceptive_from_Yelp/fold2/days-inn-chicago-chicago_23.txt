I booked a room for $171.11 for a one night stay in a small double room. Imagine my horror when I was charged $360.12 PRIOR to my stay. If I were going to pay $360 for a night....it certainly would not be for a tiny room.....nor would it be in a Days Inn but a much nicer Marriott up on the Gold Coast. Shame on you Days Inn. Shoddy business practice, shoddy hotel and tiny room. Cancelled this reservation and moved to a much better hotel.
