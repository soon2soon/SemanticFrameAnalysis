My wife and I took the Loup Highlight Tour with Larry as our guide. It was an amazing experience and way beyond anything we were expecting. Everything about the tour was perfect - the information, the clarity, the pace. My wife is not a native English speaker but she had no trouble following along. We took some other tours (paid and free) and they were nowhere near as good as this one. We kept referring back to the information Larry gave us during the rest of our trip in Chicago. It was invaluable to really appreciating our time there. The fact that it was free makes it even more amazing. We did tip generously at the end because we got so much value out of it but at no time was tipping even mentioned. Larry was a class act all the way. I highly recommend this tour.
