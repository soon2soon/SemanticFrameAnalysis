Wow!  I have been waiting for the Elysian to open for months.  As soon as my husband and I could make a trip to Chicago was  2 days after Christmas-and God was it cold in the "Windy City".  Warmed by our in suite fireplace and excellant wine we had the most relaxing, delightful escape followed by excellant shopping! The help was friendly to the max --and would not except a tip for any service, the Spa services outstanding (the best facial I've ever had) and truly the most personable greeting every time we left or returned to the hotel ! My husband and I are spoiled-our own home is beautiful and hard to leave and we always choose our hotels very carefully- The Elysian was truly a home away from home with outstanding elegance and 24 hour PERSONAL service!! We will be back!! Margaret W  Raleigh,NC 1/27/09
