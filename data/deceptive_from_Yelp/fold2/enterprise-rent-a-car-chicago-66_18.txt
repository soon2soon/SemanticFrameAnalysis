Very satisfied with the result. Once we were at baggage claim and got our luggage, all I had to do was call them and they picked my wife and I up at the airport and took us back to their office to do the paper work. We were a little skeptical at first because it was much cheaper than anything else in the area for car rental and we didn't know what to expect, but we got a nice, clean 07' corrolla. Which was about standard for what other places offered, but a few hundred less. We did get a flat tire, but it was due to running over a nail. The owner was pretty cool about it and though it clearly states that all renters are responsible for tire repairs in the paperwork, he agreed to go in on half with me. Later, when we dropped off the car, he changed his mind and reimbursed me for the full amount, which was really great because he truly didn't have to do anything since it was our problem and the rules were clearly stated out. Last than, they were able to drop us back off at the airport so even though they aren't technically located at SFO, they go above and beyond making sure you don't have any hassel getting to them. Overall, great experience.
