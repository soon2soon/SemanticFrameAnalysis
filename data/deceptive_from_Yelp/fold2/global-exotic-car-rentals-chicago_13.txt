I surprised my husband with a Ferrari rental for the weekend and I must say it was one of the best gifts I got him.  I worked with Moe, who was fantastic during the whole process.  He helped plan the surprise.  He setup to have the car delivered in the morning and when my husband walked out the car was waiting for him with a huge bow-tie on the car. . The process was seamless and when we were done with the car they picked it up from our house. We will definitely rent from them again!
