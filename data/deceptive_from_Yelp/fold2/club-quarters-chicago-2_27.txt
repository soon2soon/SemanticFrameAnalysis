I stayed here for a conference in Chicago. The room was exactly what I needed, super clean and comfortable. The hotel provided many services which make the difference : free coffee, free wifi with no hassle, the ability to print, free bottled water. The staff was particularly professional and friendly. They helped us to receive an important mail directly at the hotel. I will definitely go back there : altogether a great experience !
