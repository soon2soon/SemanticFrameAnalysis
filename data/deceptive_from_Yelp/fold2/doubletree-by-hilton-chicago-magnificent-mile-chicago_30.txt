The service was excellent! I had to call for a razor at 5AM and they brought it up to me within 2 minutes. Very friendly and fast service. Elevators were a little slow but they had signs up indicating they were working on updating them. I did not pay for this hotel so I can't comment on the price for what I got, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Great night sleep, friendly/helpful staff, and the hotel restaurant even reopened for us!
