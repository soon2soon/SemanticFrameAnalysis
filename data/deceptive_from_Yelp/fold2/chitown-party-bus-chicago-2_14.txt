I used ChiTown Party Bus a few months ago when a group of us wanted to go on a pub crawl. I have to say, I was thoroughly Â impressed with the level of Customer Service I received. These guys don't miss a beat. Communication was never an issue. Phone calls and emails were answered promptly and the driver was very punctual. Now for the good part... OMG we had SO much fun. The bus was clean, the stereo was rocking and the driver was awesome! He bent over backwards to make sure all our needs were met and we were having a great time. Two weeks ago I had a Bachelorette Party for my best friend. I used these guys again and received the same stellar treatment. I really am impressed with the quality service I got. Chris Vee is doing an awesome job and not only do I plan to book with them again, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a wicked fun night out to do the same! THANK YOU CHITOWN PARTY BUS!!!!!
