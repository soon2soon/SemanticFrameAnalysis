We stayed at Club Quarters this weekend and I must say we were very pleased. I can not stress enough how awesome the staff here are! Everyone was super nice and helpful, especially Justin at the front desk. He always remembered us when we came and left, always made sure we had everything we needed, made great suggestions for things to do in the area and is super nice! We originally had booked just the regular small room but when we checked in we were offered the chance to upgrade one level for $15, so we said why not? Well it happened that those all sold out so for the inconvenience they upgraded us to the suite for the same price. They suite was very large. The hotel is very nice and updated, the room was nice as well. The free bottled water in the hallways is great as well as the free sleep kits you can get from the front desk! My only complaint about this hotel were the beds were pretty horrible. The mattress was pretty old, cheap and very uncomfortable and squeaky. Also the bed linens were cheap and wasn't a big fan. If they upgraded the beds this place would be 5 stars in my book, especially for the price! Not to mention the location of the Central Loop is FANTASTIC! We would definitely stay here again!
