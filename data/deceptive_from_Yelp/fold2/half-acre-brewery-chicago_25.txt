I love Half Acre - the place, the cans, the people, the creativity, the Ween-ness, everything. I could survive on cans of Daisy Cutter for years on end. I love stopping at Half Acre, but be aware of what you are walking in to...This place is not a brewpub or a bar - they wont sell you a pint but rather will offer very small samples of whats on tap. The taps are pretty consistent with usually one specialty flowing at a time. They will fill growlers, which aren't particularly cheap, but are handy.
