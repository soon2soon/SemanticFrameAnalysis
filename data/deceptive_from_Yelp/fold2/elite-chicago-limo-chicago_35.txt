Elite's Mercedes party bus is to die for! My friends and I spent the whole night driven around Chicago bars like royalty.  Last year, we did a similar venture but with a limo and it doesn't even compare.  Lights, crazy loud music system, comfort, all unmatched compared to a limousine.  On top of it all, their driver Alex had such a chill personality - he didn't mind our wild drunkenness at all and simply did his job while staying polite and courteous.  By far the best Birthday ever.
