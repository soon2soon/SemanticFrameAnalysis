As a non-beer drinker, I was a little skeptical when I realized my friends and I were heading to a brewery tour.  However, I had a great time! The staff was personable as they relayed the interesting history of craft breweries in general and Half Acre specifically.  My beer drinking buddies loved the full samples they were provided, and I didn't feel any pressure or judgment from the staff or others on the tour when I refrained from the beer and availed myself of the inconspicuous water coolers.   A fun, low-key morning and a cute commemorative glass.  I don't know that I'd go again, but I'd definitely recommend that people go once!
