What a great way to zip through the lake front,,,,super fun and easy to operate. Nate, our guide was funny and very informative. He made learning how to ride a segway simple "Just don't think about it." So true and in a few minutes we were on our way! Nate had interesting details about the city and the typically jokes - VERY entertaining.
