We were in Chicago for a family wedding. The reception was held at Diplomat Motel, so we decided to book our stay there as well. Every single employee treated us as if we were the most important people there! The hotel manager surprised and delighted us by having a delicious chocolate cake delivered to our room for my husband's upcoming birthday. Our room was quiet, comfortable and overlooked Lake Michigan.
