Everything was right at this hotel.  It's not the Four Seasons, and it's not intended to be.  It's a no-frills hotel, centrally located in Chicago's Loop, and just a couple of hundred feet from the Monroe Stop on the CTA blue line that will take you downtown from O'Hare airport, and not far from the Madison/Wabash stop on the orange line that takes you downtown from Midway airport.  The free breakfast gives you a lot of choices for what to eat, the beds are comfortable, and the staff is very helpful.
