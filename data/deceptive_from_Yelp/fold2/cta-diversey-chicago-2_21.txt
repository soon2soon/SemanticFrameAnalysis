Mr. Brown is hygienic, offers a nice view and the seating is quite comfy. Mr. Brown also suffers from bipolar disorder. Sometimes Brown runs reaaaalllly slowly. Which is great if you feel like staring at the view passing by in slow motion-style, but a nightmare if you have to be at work on time. I am currently bald because I have pulled all the hair of my head waiting for the so called 'clearance signal'. I'm not even sure what it means but it makes me feel insecure and a bit kookoo. Yesterday I came to work 40 minutes late because Mr. Brown had suddenly decided to run Express and abandoned me at the Western stop with no explanation whatsoever. You knew my stop was Irving Park and not Western. But nooo. You had to rush there anyways, like you were on some kind of insane drug. I asked Mr.Brown why he would do such a thing to me; I had been so faithful these last couple of months. I didn't know where I was... I was lost... so far away from work... And from home too. It was cold... There were no cabs... I was wondering what my boss would say. WHY BROWN WHY!!!!
