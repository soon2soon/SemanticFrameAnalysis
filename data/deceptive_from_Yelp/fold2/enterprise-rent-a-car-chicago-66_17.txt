I reserved a car online with Enterprise, the day of the rental they called to make sure I was coming in, I stated that I was and then they stated I needed a major credit card.  I told them I did not have one and that I had rented from them before with no issues (I was in a rush to go and get the car and I was heading out of town for a funneral).  They said they would rent to me if I broght in my photo id and my utility bills, I said I only had a cable invoice as all my bills are paid online and then they wanted me to come to their office and bring up my accounts on their computer, I had an issue with this, as I don't use public computers to bring up my bills.  When I told the guy to forget it, I would use another company, he started to get nasty on the phone.  I really didn't need his attitude on such a stressful day.  I will never rent from them again.
