I got a massage today at Elysian Spa and it was the best massage I have ever had!!!!! I dont even have words to describe it! I recommend it to everyone - I know its a little pricey but you will enjoy and love every second of it. The oils and creams they used are incredible!  By the way the girl who gave me a massage is Stephanie (Muscle Relax Therapy) - She is AWESOME!!!!! a professional!  Everything at the Spa is amazing!! I thought I was in a fairy tale for 2 hours!!! Love Love Love Elysian Spa and Stephanie :) I am soooooooo going back!
