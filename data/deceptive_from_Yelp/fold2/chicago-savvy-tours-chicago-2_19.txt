Fantastic Tour! This is a must for Chicagoans and tourists. George Â was our guide, he was energetic, knowledgeable of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Oak Park area in general. His manner of speaking was delightful, I hung on every word. I can't wait to take another tour with this company. I learned so much and had a lot of fun at the same time.What more can you ask for
