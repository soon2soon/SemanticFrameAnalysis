My husband and I have rented homes through Gameday Housing three times, and it has been a really nice experience.  The homes are exactly as described on the website.  We can walk to campus for football games, which is great. We have found that this is the only way for our family to enjoy a weekend in South Bend - we aren't crammed into a hotel room, the kids have space to sleep and have fun, and the adults can hang out.  We will be repeat customers every football season.
