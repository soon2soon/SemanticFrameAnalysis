The location of this hotel is wonderful! Thats the positive. It goes down hill from there. My husband and I came from Canada, we arrived early and asked if we could check in early. We were charged $35.00. This was odd as we have never experienced that before. Even Toronto hotels do not charge guests. We spent a lot of money to stay for three days. The room was small, there was mold on the ceiling, two single beds pushed together to create a King size bed. The gym was not very nice, but did the job. On a positive note, the housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping the room clean. We liked that the water was available, we liked the free wifi. Staff were friendly and helpful. Today was checkout day, we brought our bags downstairs to checkout at 12:45pm and were charged ANOTHER $35.00 for being 45 minutes past checkout. If we were told that there would be a checkout fee for being past the time, we would have certainly brought our bags downstairs. I am not sure if this is standard for hotels and we were not aware. To us it seemed like a desperate attempt by the hotel to get as much money out of us as they could. We went through Expedia and paid over a  $1000.00 for the hotel (3 nights).  We expected more I guess. We will definitely go back to Chicago people are friendly and restaurants excellent! We will however, never stay at the Club Quarters.
