This place was a great vacation spot for my husband, 15 month old son, and myself.  We really enjoyed the cozy condo and loved the Lakeview area.  Tons of restaurants and shops and so close to Wrigley.  Right next to CTA brown line stop Southport; we didn't need a car!  Jim the owner provides great customer service.  Thanks again!  Def would stay here again.
