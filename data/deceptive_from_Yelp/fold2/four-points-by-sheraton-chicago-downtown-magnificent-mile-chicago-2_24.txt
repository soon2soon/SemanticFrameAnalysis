This hotel is in an EXCELLENT location. Smack in the middle of everything and a great center point to start your Chicago Adventure. 1 Blk to the Miraculous Mile and convenient to the El and Buses. The hotel itself is clean, well decorated and has 3 restaurants, a bar, a Trader Joes' and a Starbucks attached to building. Honestly- you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a food joint over there so trust me- you'll never be hungry. The staff was professional, knowledgeable and very friendly. The two doormen- Phillip and Catlette are the S! Want a cab? You'll wait 30 seconds for one...before you know it- your bags in the car...they're quick so don't blink! There is a Heated Indoor Pool, a Jacuzzi and a VERY small gym on the 5th floor. The pool and jacuzzi is a nice place to relax after a long day and it was great to have a gym in the hotel instead of having to go out and find one. The gym is the size of one of the hotel rooms- so don't expect it to be any bigger or very well equipt. It has the basics and THAT'S IT! The ROOM: Nothing fancy but nice still the same. The bed was amazing! A pillow top with big, fluffy pillows! I slept like I was dead- seriously. Also in the room was a super comfy chair with and ottoman. It was ugly but so comfortable that if I could have stolen it and slipped into my bag I would have. The chair and I had a love affair that will never be forgotten. DRAWBACK: Parking downtown is EXPENSIVE and even though you get a discount if you are staying at the hotel- it's STILL $38 an night! Seriously? To park your car? THAT"S a total rip but then again- That's Chicago! I would SO stay here again! I enjoyed staying at this hotel VERY much!
