I loved our stay here.  Very modern room with all the amenities.  Ample dresser and closet space, cool bathroom with see-thru large shower (curtain for the shy) with great raining shower head.  Great views, fantastic location walking distance to pier, parks, NBC, etc.  Concierge Manager Tim, personality plus!!, and Romeo/concierge, will help you navigate the city and reserve tickets for shows, tours, etc.   Service staff all very attentive and charming!! I will definitely return to Chicago in the early summer and stay at The Dana Hotel. PS - The Grand Lux Cafe is around the corner a block or so and a great spot for a surprisingly easy on the budget lunch with great street views and decor.  Miso salmon with brown rice and grilled veggies $13.95!!  I couldn't eat it all!
