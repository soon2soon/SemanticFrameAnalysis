Excellent property. Close to public transportation and excellent restaurants and bars. Too bad the Cubs don't play in February, because is would have bee a very short walk to Wrigley Field. The properety was very quaint, clean and well-maintained. We will definitely recommend this to others and will try to stay here again on future trips to Chicago.
