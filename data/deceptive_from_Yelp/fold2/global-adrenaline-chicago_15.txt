Global Adrenaline planned my trip to the Inka Trail and Machu Picchu.  From the second I got off of the plane until departing back home the experience was incredible. I was met at the airport by our guide who stayed with us for 9 days. We had a group of 6 people and we all were on different flights getting into Peru. Instead of making me wait at the airport for others to arrive they took me back to the hotel right away so I could wait for my group to arrive in comfort.  Our guide was incredible, his knowledge was great and you could tell he adapted his persona to fit the group. If you go on this trip make sure to bring gifts for the porters.  The team they had for us was great.  Our meals were always ready for us when we arrived at camp and they stuck around after we would begin our hikes to pack up our stuff.  The food we ate while on the trail for four days was incredible, I never would have thought we would have eaten different meals everyday or that steak would have been one of them. They were incredibly excited when they were presented with our camping gear, sweatshirts and anything else we were able to give. I had purchased severally things with the intention of only using them on the trip and was glad someone was excited to use them after I was done. I wasn't sure what to expect but after the trip concluded I do not know anything that could have been done better.  The hotels we stayed at were much nicer than others we passed in Cusco and Aguas Calientes, the campsites were perfect and the help they used was incredible. I have and will continue to recommend them for anyone looking to take an exotic trip. They take away any concerns and allow you to truly enjoy your once in a lifetime vacation.
