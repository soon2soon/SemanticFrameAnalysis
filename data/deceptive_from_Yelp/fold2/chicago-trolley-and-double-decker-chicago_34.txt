My family and I just returned from a great trip to Chicago and I can't stop telling people about it. I was told by a friend that the best way to see the city was to take a Chicago Trolley Tour or Double Decker Tour. We bought three, 3-day passes for $95, (which included a free Chicago souvenir). This tour was GREAT! These tickets allowed us to get off the trolley or double decker at assigned spots in the downtown area and we were also able to take a neighborhood tour that took us out of downtown area to visit the ethnic communities of the city. I know I gained at least 5 pounds eating all that great food. Â I have to recommend taking this tour not just because it's a great tour and a good value but because they offer excellent customer service. Our tour guide recommended trying the popcorn at Garrets (which came free) so I got off the trolley and went to get my free bag, unfortunately the trolley with my family still on it drove off. FYI the trolleys don't wait for you. I called the Chicago Trolley Co. and told them what happened. They sent a manager to pick me up and he drove me to the next stop where they had located my family. I don't know of many companies that would take the time to help you for your own mistake. The Chicago Trolley Co. made my visit to the city a lot of fun and I would highly recommend anyone visiting Chicago to take this tour.
