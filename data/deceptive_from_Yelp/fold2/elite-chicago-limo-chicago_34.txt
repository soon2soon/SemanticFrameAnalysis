We rented a 8 person limo but because it was already booked, they upgraded us to the 14 person stretch Lincoln Navigator at no additional cost.  We got it for my son's 16th birthday and it was worth it just to see the looks on their faces.  They had stocked the bar with soda and the service was amazing.  I highly recommend them!
