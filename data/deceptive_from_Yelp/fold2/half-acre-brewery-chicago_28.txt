I heart Half Acre. Not really sure why its called that since it's a small store front attached to a decent sized warehouse where they make the beer but there's probably a good story there. I enjoy the vast majority of their beers and the staff is always wonderfully helpful and unpretentious. No on here is going to judge you if you don't know what you want or don't understand beer. Plus like half the that work there have cool mustaches. It does nothing for the beer quality but who doesn't like a good mustache? The store is always neat and super clean. It can get indecently busy and the line is often out the door. They're pretty quick though so you don't have to wait too long and even if you do they sometimes come around handing out small samples. The prices for growlers are reasonable and they even sell/rent kegs at really good prices. We've gotten a couple of the small ones (1/6 barrel or 5.2 gallons) for parties and it was an excellent idea. It costs less than buying a bunch of 6packs and its way better (and comparatively priced to the ones at Binny's!) to a keg of Miller Light. The only reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is their tour. It might be awesome, but despite several attempts we've never been able to get on it. I understand that they need to limit how many people they take and how often they offer them but it's just a little too intense for me. Its really not their fault they're so popular but its still a bit of a bummer that they can't come up with a better system.
