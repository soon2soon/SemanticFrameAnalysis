We rented from Chitown party bus before doing out pre-x-mas pub crawl and had a blast. Last year we rented the small party bus the Mac Daddy and for this year we need bigger...alot bigger. I called Chris who is a great guyto deal with and he set me up with there Big Daddy party bus (i love the names). It was super easy to get the ball rolling and Chris loves details, which make ne feel at ease. The week before they called just to confirm everything and the morning of sent me a text message with my drivers name and cell number. Big Daddy arrived 10 mins early and the driver Kevin helped the boys load up. Big Daddy is an converted school bus made into a party bus...disco lights,bar, striper poles and disco lights. I know they have newer and nicer party buses...but this one fit the bill. We started the trip off with a bang and had such a great time ridding from one bar to another and Kevin was awesome. We even blew off the last bar just to send time on the bus and dance....yes I enen worked the POLE. ;)
