Very disappointed in my departure from Chinatown. It is a beautiful way to see the city but No organization at all. I had kids with me and as we started to get on adults were pushing and shoving them to get on the boat. There should be a line and someone to control the loads of people trying to take this type of transportation. I will not take this way again.
