I was planning a trip to China, but did not know that Visa requests had to be made in person.  I recently moved to Minnesota and it would have taken a lot of time and headache for me to travel to Chicago to the Consulate office and I was in a rush since I already had made my plane reservations.  Then I found China Visa Service Center (CVSC) on the Internet.   All I can say is...they were wonderful !     I dealt with Salina, the Branch Manager.  Staff speak English and are very helpful and efficient. They explained all the steps clearly and sent email verification of receipt of my documents and emailed shipping status updates as well.   It was all very clear and efficient.  They took care of the whole process for me and I received my Visa on the day they promised.  The process was very smooth and was well WORTH the reasonable service fee.  And it cost a lot less than going in-person to Chicago.   I highly recommend China Visa Service Center to anyone !
