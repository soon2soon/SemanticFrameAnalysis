The river cruise is definitely a must see of Chicago. In the 90 minutes on the boat, you get to tour the North, East and South branches of the Chicago river. You start in the middle of the eastern branch and head west, then to the North branch. You go up to Goose Island. Then you head toward the south branch and then out towards Navy Pier on the Eastern Branch. Along the way, the docent points out various architectural giants with many interesting facts. You get the see quite a number of beautiful buildings. For me, I think it helps to read up on the architecture just a bit prior to the tour so you can follow along. Sometimes I was so focused on getting a good picture that I missed out of what the docent was saying! Weather: It stays about the same as it is on land, probably just a BIT chillier with slightly more wind but I ended up regretting the sweater I brought for the occasion. You probably won't need anything extra unless it is a very cloudy day. There is a bar and bathroom on the boat. Be sure to get there just a bit on the earlier side so that you can grab a good seat. It looks like on my "sold out" tour, that everyone was able to sit outside, so the group doesn't book up the boat fully and force some people to stay inside instead. You can also get tickets online and get it 'will call' or print at home for convenience.
