We used Chitown Party Bus and had a GREAT time! We did a pub-crawl to Chicago in the Big Daddy party bus and everybody said it was the best crawl of the year. Chris made it so easy to book the party bus and our driver Bill had the route in hand and had everything in control so "I" can enjoy myself and not worry. I WILL USE THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!
