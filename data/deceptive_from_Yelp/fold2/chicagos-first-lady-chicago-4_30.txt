This tour is a must for anyone visiting Chicago. It is a bit pricey, but if the money is supporting a good cause, I'm okay with it. We went on a Sunday morning and, perhaps because of the chilly, rainy weather, were able to walk up to the ticket window at 9:20am and buy our tickets for the 9:30am boat. We learned a lot about the various architectural styles of the buildings and a bit about Chicago's history, and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly in spite of the weather (they sell ponchos on the boat for $2). Not just knowledgeable, the guide was also quite entertaining: if you have your bridal shower as a private event on the boat, for a small fee, he'll do the tour topless.
