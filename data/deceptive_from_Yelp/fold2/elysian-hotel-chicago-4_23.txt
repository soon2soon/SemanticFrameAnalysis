All I have to say is WOW! I consider myself a bit of a hotel snob after staying in hotels all over the world. This wonderful property doesn't miss a beat and has all the plushness of the perfect bed to all the tech stuff to keep the boys happy. I love that I don't have to keep bills in my pocket as the hotel staff is there to help and doesn't accept tips...what really? I am hoping that that is because they are paid well. Judging by the staffs helpful nature and cheery self's I am guessing they are. This is a must stay hotel and I mean must!!
