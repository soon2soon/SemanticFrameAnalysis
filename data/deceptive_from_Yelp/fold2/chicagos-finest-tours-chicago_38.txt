What a great informational tour!!!  We had a large group of 11 family members that ranged in ages from 18 to 50, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Just minutes into the tour, the lively tour director Dan and his cute assistant Kelly had us all mesmorized!  We learned so many fascinating details about Chicago's history!  The guys in our group were really listening carefully, because they continued to throw out many Chicago trivia tidbits the remainder of our weekend! If you're looking for a way to enjoy the outdoors and city sights and also learn some Chicago facts along the way, this is a great tour.  It's more personal than the architectural boat tour that I've taken.  And I also had a much easier time hearing on this tour.  The walk is easy, but it's still good to wear comfortable shoes as you'll likely be on your feet for the full two hours--the time is quite enjoyable and goes fast!
