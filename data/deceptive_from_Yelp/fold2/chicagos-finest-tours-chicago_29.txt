I took this tour with nine of my friends. With 10 people, we were able to get a private tour. I would describe this as more of a Chicago history tour rather than a sight-seeing tour. Â We took the Sunday brunch tour which was about a three hour tour... two hours for the tour with an hour stop at 12:30 for lunch. We had lunch at O'Brien's which was very good and enjoyable right by the river. We walked about two miles along both sides of the river during the tour. Our guide, Rick, was very informative. Even though we live in the Chicago area, much of what he told us was new to us. Basically Rick covered the founding of the city of Chicago and many historical events that happened here. We stopped several times and sat along the river while Rick gave us information. We could also follow along in a booklet that he gave us at the beginning of the tour. (These had to be returned at the end.) Rick was very cordial and interesting. The only reason I didn't give this tour five stars is because I would have prefered a bit more walking and learning about the buidlings, etc. around the river area. However, to be fair, that is not what this tour is about. It is a history of Chicago tour and you do learn alot about that. For those that are wondering, there isn't alot of walking, but you do go up and down some stairs. We had an absolutely beautiful day for our tour and it was wonderful to be downtown and learn more about our city. I would recommend this tour to others.
