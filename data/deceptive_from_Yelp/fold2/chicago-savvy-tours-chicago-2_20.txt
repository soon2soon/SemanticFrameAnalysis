We had a wonderful tour of Oak Park with George as our tour guide. He was full of information but didn't over-burden the casual tourist with his knowledge. The tour was well-planned and rich with visual examples to help us learn and understand the importance of Frank Lloyd Wright! Â Highly recommend this tour!
