I purchased a GroupOn coupon for the Pedway tour for our weekday visit to Chicago. The guide, owner Dan, was great. It was a good introduction to both Chicago history and trivia and to the Pedway. I especially enjoyed visiting the building that was originally the Chicago Library with it's Tiffany glass and mosaics (we went back the next day to see it again.) One warning: I ended up with shin-splints from walking on the hard surfaces; I'd suggest VERY cushioned shoes. My SAS FreeTimes weren't cushy enough, I guess.
