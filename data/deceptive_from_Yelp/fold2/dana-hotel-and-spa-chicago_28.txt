I paid $170 for one night in a king room, plus $39 for overnight valet parking. Not bad for a hotel in this part of the town, but I visited during low season (e.g., WINTER!) This hotel has location, location, and location in it's favor.  Within walking distance of so many great amenities that Chicago has to offer. The staff are generally friendly and responsive.  My room was very, very nice. I stayed on the 21st floor, and the floor to ceiling window offered a great city-scape view. The finishes are really nice: hardwood floors and carpeting, plus tile and a very nice marble (?) for the bathroom counter. There were six pillows on the bed. Yes, six. The shower was great (it is designed with a pass-through view to the bedroom) - that is, one side of the shower opens into the bathroom, and the other side, a floor to ceiling glass pane, looks into the bedroom. There's a curtain you can draw over the pane if you want privacy.  There was a large sitting chair with pillows and  blanket that I could draw up to the window to take in the view.  The TV was huge (by my standards). One negative detail: some of the furniture is very worn.  The leather on one of the arms rests on the office chair was almost completely worn away: it looked like someone had taken a pair of scissors and deliberately scratched off the leather. I'm not sure why the hotel hasn't replaced the chair.
