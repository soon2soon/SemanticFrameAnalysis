The trip was terrific! Meadows is THE greatest guide! He's an excellent instructor (we were up and riding in no time, including giving situation-specific tips, e.g. suggesting I duck to curtsy to stop), great psychologist (dealt nicely with my wife's and daughter's fears and insecurities), knowledgeable guide (knows his stuff), but not too imposing (no constant babbling). We had IMHO the best tour time (fireworks) and a "private" tour (we were the only party). Would HIGHLY recommend to everybody.
