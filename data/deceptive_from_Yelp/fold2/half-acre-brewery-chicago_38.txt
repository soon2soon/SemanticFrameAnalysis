When people ask me "gimme some good Chicago breweries..." the first one to come to mind is always Half Acre.  These guys know what they are doing when it comes to brewing beer.  Daisy- cutter is a Chicago standard and ,in my opinion, sets the bar pretty high to what good beer should be.  They change their beers all the time so you are always surprised by a new brew!  The staff that work there are always eager to help you out and let you sample the beers on tap before you buy them which is always a very good thing! All and all I can't really say anything bad except that the actual location was a little small......until they opened up their tap room!!!!  To make a long story short,if you like beer and are in Chicago, it's definitely worth the trip to go out there and have a few pints.
