I've stayed here a few weeks in a row and it's not exactly a fun place to be. It is exactly what it's supposed to be - a cheaper business hotel. The bed is there and the desk is there and the TV is there but nothing really stands out and makes you feel like you want to be there. The people are not good at following instructions - I asked them to stop delivering papers to the room but they kept on doing it.
