I'd had very poor experiences in the past with other taxi/limo services - so after looking through Yelp reviews decided to give Going Green a try. They were AWESOME! We booked them from our house (far west suburbs) to O'Hare and back. The drivers were prompt, courteous, friendly, professional, and didn't drive like maniacs. They engaged us in conversation - not the typical "I have to act interested in the passenger" talk, but a genuine care and concern for our upcoming trip. We were traveling with some very heavy luggage, and they toted it all around with not a complaint. In short - all I could hope for from a limo company, and the fact that they use "green" cars is icing on the cake. Would very highly recommend!
