Horrible company! The ticket people are pushy and rude- and when you have a question they YELL at you as if you are stupid. I asked about the prices ($40!) and they just yelled at me the price and said "are you buying or not!?" The customer service is terrible- and the tour is a snooze. If you are from out of town or looking for a good time- take your business to Wendella (across the river). The prices are more reasonable (children and elderly rates) and they are just kinder. It seems this company is all about the money- which is really sad considering they are supposed to represent Chicago.
