The Elysian hotel is the only hotel we go to when we are in Chicago. We also had one of our engagement parties at the Elysian and put up our guests for the weekend and everyone just loved it! They gushed about their amazing suites and rooms, as well as the impeccable service. Whether you are an out of towner or local, I highly recommend spending a night at the Elysian, you are sure to come back each and every time!
