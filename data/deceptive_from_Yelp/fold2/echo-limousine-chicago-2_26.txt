Why did I not look on yelp for sedan service to/from ORD? I spent way too much money and time on American Limo and other services. I finally used Echo and will never, ever go anywhere else. BEST sedan service ever. My latest driver Eddy was awesome. Very professional, did not text and drive, the car was clean and no overwhelming scents, safe driver, pleasant and talkative but not too talkative, great music (Etta James and Frank) playing. First time I did not have to wait for 10-30 minutes on the driver. It was cold outside and Eddy texted and said to wait inside and he would text when he arrived. Very courteous. Â  Overall, best sedan service I've had not just in Chicago, but in other cities as well. Hopefully Echo can take whatever their model is that is working and branch out to other cities. Other travelers will appreciate it!
