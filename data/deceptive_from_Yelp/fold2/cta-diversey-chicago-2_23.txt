Having just penned a one-star review of a local business, I feel the need to balance the negativity with something more positive.  It is too easy to rant and forget that praise is just as important. Contemplating all the possibilities for kudos, I settled on the CTA.  Yes, that's right, the CTA.  I was reading in RedEye this morning about the challenges that CTA continues to face, in this case about the State of Illinois not paying its bills.   You know, all things considered the CTA does a pretty great job with what they have to work with.  I do enjoy my morning rides on the #134 and #156 buses, as well as my afternoon and evening rides on the Brown Line.  One of the great things about Chicago is living without a car, and the CTA makes that possible.  So "thank you" CTA!
