Come on, you only live once!  The Four Seasons Chicago is in a superb location, with Michigan Ave at your doorstep.  Concierge staff is extraordinarily attentive.     The rooms may be somewhat smallish for the price you pay, but are very quiet & peaceful.  Comfortable beds, luxurious bathrooms.  Try to get a room on one of the higher floors with a view of the lake.   Other highlights:  great spa and fitness center (check out the showers); 24 hour business center.   Within walking distance of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Hancock Observatory.
