My first trip to Chicago and I need car service. I found Chicago's Finest Worldwide Car service in my search. Due to the wonderful reviews I went a head and called for a rate. The agent I spoke with was wonderful! She booked my trip and offered me a bag meet. After I landed in the O'hare airport I was greeted by my driver Andrew who assisted us to the car. He was fantastic! Very pleasant and well groomed. Our trip to my destination was flawless and definately worth the money. This is the only service I will be Â useing on my next travel. I also found out that they offered worldwide service which is definately a plus for me. As Jerry stated it is indeed, "Chicago's best kept secret"
