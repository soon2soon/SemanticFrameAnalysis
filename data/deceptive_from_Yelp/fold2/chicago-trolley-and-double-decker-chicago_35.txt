I had the best time on the Chicago Trolley and Double Decker tour!! On top of a Double Decker is the only way to see the city.  My elderly father had come to visit, and we were looking for convenient ways to sight see around the city that would minimize the amount of walking he had to do.  This tour was the perfect fit!  Not only does it stop at all the attractions that we wanted to explore all day long, but also the drivers and guides were extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.  The tours that we heard were highly entertaining and suitable for every age in our group.  We were able to see everything from Navy Pier, to the Sears Tower, and then they even went all the way out to china Town.  I would definitely recommend a trip on the Chicago Trolleys and Double Deckers!!!
