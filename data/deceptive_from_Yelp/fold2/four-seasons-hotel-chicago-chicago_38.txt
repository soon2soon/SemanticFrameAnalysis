I had the best brunch of my life at the Four Seasons Chicago.  $70-80 a head, but it's worth twice that.  The food really is amazing.  Sushi bar, fine cheeses and meats, great ethnic variety, small tapa plates which were fantastic, and the desserts were awesome. Not a lot of specific detail in this review - this is because I blacked out due to sensory overload related to how fantastic the food was here.  10 stars.
