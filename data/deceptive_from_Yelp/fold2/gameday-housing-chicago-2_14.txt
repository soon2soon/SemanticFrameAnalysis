We have been renting with Gameday for the past few years and have had nothing but good experiences.  They follow up with you as the homeowner and take care of all communications with the renters.  It is true that, once the renters arrive,  you have to hope they are trustworthy.  But, people paying $800 night to stay in your home are usually the type of people who respect your place.  Gameday takes care of all of the advertising and hassle---and by Tuesday the $$ is sitting in your bank account.  I have referred several friends who now offer their homes and they are all satisfied as well.  My only complaint is that too many people are now renting their homes because Gameday is getting so popular!!
