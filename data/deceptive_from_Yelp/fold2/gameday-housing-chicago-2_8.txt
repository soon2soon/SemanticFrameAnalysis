These guys are bad news if you are a home owner. They seem to specialize in renting party houses.  If you care about your home, dont list it though here.  Sure they take a deposit for damages but they do not stand by the homeowner when it comes time to pay for damages.  They are great if you dont mind people urinating on your furniture or barfing on your carpets.
