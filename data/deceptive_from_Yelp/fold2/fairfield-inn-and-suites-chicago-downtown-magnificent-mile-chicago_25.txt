This was our first time in Chicago and we had a first class experience. I highly recommend the Fairfield if you are looking for a 5 star hotel at a 2 star price. The staff is top notch and the entire hotel is contemporary and polished. Great service and friendly helpful staff. Thank you Fairfield for making our stay so enjoyable!
