I went to Chicago to visit a friend of mine last summer. I had been there before and felt as though I knew everything about the city, but this time my friend got us some tickets for the Chicago Trolley hop on and hop off tour and I am so glad that she did! The best things about the tour were the tour guides. The tour guides were absolutely excellent. They were so knowledgeable about the city, which I found to be fascinating and I learned so much about a city that I had visited before! They were interesting and they were also very entertaining and kept us laughing the whole time. We had two different tour guides, one took us from the Sears Tower to Millennium Park and then went on break and that was when the second tour guide stepped on board, and we were given a completely different tour, which made the whole thing so wonderful to hear someone else's view of Chicago. It is also very refreshing to know that they are able to give their own tours full of their own unique perspectives and not just read off of some script that they were handed. We had such a great time on the tour that we even took the tour twice and if we had had the time we would have probably stayed and taken the tour again! I learned so much about Chicago and I highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to learn about Chicago and be entertained at the same time.
