My wife and I were in town for a few days.  We had purchased tickets through Groupon for this tour.  We were emailed two days before the tour that our scheduled time at 12:30 had been changed to 3:00 because the tour was filled.  The day of the tour we were called at 11:00 to be told the tour had been cancelled because it was just us that would be on it.  The guy sounded surprised that we were from out of town and could not reschedule for another day.  Poor service, poor customer service, don't waste your time.
