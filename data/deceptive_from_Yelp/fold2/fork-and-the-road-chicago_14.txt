The BBQ tour was great, can't say enough good things about it. If I lived in Chicago I would make a point of going on each and every tour, what a great way to spend an afternoon, biking and feasting on wonderful food, and lots of it. I expected that we would get little samples of food at each place, boy was I wrong, there was plenty of food and I really had to try and pace myself. Thank you Dimitra and Sharon for a great time, I'm going to let all my Chicago bound friends know about Fork and the Road.
