Finding a parking spot at The Fairmont was the first challenge. I parked across the street at the Prudential Plaza at $35 for the night. I later found out that was a deal because the hotel only has valet parking at $65. The second disappointment was the room. As I walked through the hotel to get to my room, I was very pleased with the grand appearance, but once I opened the door to my room, I was let down. It was an okay room, but kinda small, the carpet was hideous, there was a stain near the couch that seemed unsanitary, there was a capsule on the floor that looked like some sort of vitamin, the bed frame had remnants of hair in the crevices and I couldn't believe there was a spider web hanging on the ceiling near the entrance to the bath room. The other let down came when I found there was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. Considering the price of the hotel, those things should be included. Instead, there is a fee for ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. There was a bottle of Evian water in the room that would have cost me $10 if I opened it...such a tease.  The mini-bar was hot inside, so it made no since to store any food or personal drinks inside.That's how they get you to pay for a refrigerator.  I wanted coffee the next morning, but was afraid to open the packs of Starbucks coffee that were in the room because I may have been charged for them. They even charged for the internet, which would have been about $14.00 if i used it...unreal. Overall, the inside of the hotel is grand, the room was mediocre, and the fees charged for every single item is ridiculous.
