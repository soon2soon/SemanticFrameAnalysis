This train line is by far the nicest of all of the CTAs many options.  I had the pleasure of taking this train yesterday as I was quite tired and didn't want to drive to a party with many distinguished guests. The trip started off with a typical stop to pick up some roadies (you know, I am not driving so no harm).   I'll tell you what...those three tacos tasted ohhh so good while sitting on the luxuriously appointed train watching the silly motorists speed past me.   Once I got to the stop near the party I popped the address in my phone and noted it would only be a 2.15 mile walk. Needless to say I made it about 1.75 miles and stopped for more roadies...but sadly saw another Blue Line stop.  I wish the CTA would hire better staff to dispense directions!  The person I asked on the train demanded my guacamole and quite frankly may have been drunk.  He was about 6 foot 2, dressed in  lavender leisure suit and wearing a Santa hat.  He smelled like my Uncle does when he has a bad day betting on the ponies. In retrospect I fear I may had just asked a homeless man for directions, not a CTA employee.  Guess that is one mystery that will never be solved.
