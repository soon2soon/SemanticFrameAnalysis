**BEWARE*** - Potential "American Limo Network" Customers, AWFUL AWFUL, MEAN, DISRESPECTFUL, HORRIBLE - THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT BEST DESCRIBE American Limo Worldwide. THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY THAT I HAVE EVER PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED! Stay posted everyone, I'll be publishing a Press Releases and the Chicago News networks will be running the audio file we recorded during our recent experience with this TERRIBLE COMPANY! I have an audio recording of a guy named Mike, who literally told my wife the following:  "take your sorry ass and pick up your husband yourself, bitch!" Is this the kind of person you really want working for you and representing your business, American Limo? More importantly to the customers, specifically husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends - is this how you want to be treated by the company who's supposed to be driving you? As a business owner myself, I couldn't imagine one my staff speaking to one of my customers they way I heard "Mike" speaking to my wife. I've already contacted WGN, NBC, FOX, in not just Chicago, but the syndicated networks all over the country. Most of which have already been sent the audio file of the conversation between my wife and this company and are not just willing to run it live on their perspective networks - but are WANTING to. In addition to the media outlets, we've contacted the following agencies to report this company: -FBI -Attorney General -Better Business Bureau -Chicago Police Department -Amazon Local -And more Strongly advise you to use a different company!
