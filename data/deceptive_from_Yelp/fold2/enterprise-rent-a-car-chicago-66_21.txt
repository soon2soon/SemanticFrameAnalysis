I have had a lot of difficulty getting rental cars in the past, and one year in particular, our Thanksgiving holiday had to be cancelled because we were unable to get a rental car due to their credit card policy. However, now that we learned that we need to use a local office, and we can bring a copy of a utility bill in order to pay with a debit card we have had a much better experience. I rented a car from the State Street location and the staff was very nice and very helpful. They allowed me use two separate cards to hold the total balance. I also used another location in Springfield Illinois later during my trip and they were very helpful as well. Overall I would recommend this specific enterprise location. It was very easy to get to, where it is located and convenient for us. The car we got was very nice and was clean and in good working order. I really enjoyed driving it for the week.
