My hubby and I got married this June and we were more than pleased with the service we had received from Elite.  Their Hummer H2 was perfect in our wedding pictures and the prices were more than reasonable.   Though during the later part of the day we received some unwelcome rain, the driver was quick to help out everyone in and out of the limousine with an umbrella.
