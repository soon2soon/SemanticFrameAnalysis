Dana hotel and spa in Chicago is literally the most delightful hotel experience I've ever had. The staff is so wonderful, helpful, and pleasant- we could not have asked for better! We had a hard afternoon with travel and a few hiccups, and the bartenders downstairs Derek and Alex made it worry free! I will absolutely be back, and would recommend staying at the Dana Hotel to my family and friends.
