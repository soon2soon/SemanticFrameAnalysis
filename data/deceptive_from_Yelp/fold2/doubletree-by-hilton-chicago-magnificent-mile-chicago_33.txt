After the service I received at the front desk I would not recommend this hotel to anybody nor would I ever stayed here again. Terry at the front desk was extremely rude and had such an attitude that I decided before checkout I was going to cancel my reservation and leave. I'm not quite sure how this guy even as a job with the way he treats customers.
