Think twice before you accept the collision Damage Waiver (CDW).  You may not need to buy it at Enterprise. Normally if you have auto insurance full coverage on you own car, it will cover the rental car.  Most credit cards that you used for the rental will cover the deductible and whatever your insurance company do not cover.  I have a special CHASE Sapphire credit and it even covers the CDW or collision Waiver.  If my rental car hit a brick wall, they 'll fix the rental car.  I don't even have to report it to my insurance company. There are only a few Credit Card that offer this benefit. One thing you have to watch out is the auto insurance.  They are $16 to $20 a day.  Even if you tell them you don't want it, they may still circle it in the contract for you to sign.  Or, they don't circle anyplace and let you look at the fine print and hope that you would cycle the place where it says you want to buy insurance. Enterprise is very bad on this, especially in Las Vegas.  They push very hard and con you to take the insurance. Watch Out for Enterprise. We rented a car for 10 days in Vegas.  We told the agent that we didn't want any coverage, including collision.  Usually they would cycle the box for us to initial.  Now some Enterprise Car  agent may not do it.  They may let us look at the fine print and cycle yourselves.  They may p[oint to the general location for us to sign.  I cycled the wrong box.  Thy agent knew that we did not want any coverage,but still entered it in the computer system.  It is unethical.  Enterprise push very hard on it because it is a money maker and I think the agent who sell them may get a commission.
