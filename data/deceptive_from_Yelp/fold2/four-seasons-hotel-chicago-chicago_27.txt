The service was literally unbelievable... I stayed here for a birthday getaway and was amazed at how the staff made it feel as special as could be. Alexandra from the front desk sent up items such as fresh fruit, Fiji water, birthday champagne, along with a piece of birthday cake with 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate. It was all topped off with a handwritten birthday card. It made my birthday truly special and I couldn't thank Alexandra and the staff more. Oh, and the room and view were wonderful too! Highly recommend it!!
