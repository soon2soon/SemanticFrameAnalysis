I can't give a courtyard 5 stars.  It's not the 4 Seasons, but it was EVERYTHING you could ask for.  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. The location is great.  We stayed for 3 nights and walked almost everywhere (Hankcock, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Buckingham fountain, boat tours, and numerous great eating establishments.  All this and a Starbucks in the lobby!  The rooms look they had been  recently redone.  All in all I would highly recommend it!
