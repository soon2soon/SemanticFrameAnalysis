You need to have an appreciation for timeless beauty to really appreciate Courtyard Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. It's elegant and classy. It has that titanic feel to it. The rooms are comfortable and quiet. The location is perfect for shoppers and foodies! It's also right across from the Lake Michigan beach. Just perfect! We loved it here and said it will be our yearly getaway.
