I would like to commend Cindy, the manager at this hotel.   There was some oversight when I booked the reservation through a third party. After speaking with Cindy, the situation was efficiently resolved in a professional manner.  She made sure the matter was settled and I was no longer worried about the stay at Days Inn.  It is because of her that the decision was made to keep the reservation.  This establishment is fortunate to have such an admirable and outstanding manager as she is absolutely delightful and key to the success of your business. Cindy is held in high regard.
