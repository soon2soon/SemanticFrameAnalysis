Definitely a nice hotel. Stayed here on a weekend in a great spot centered in the city. Great staff, no issues. Although, the security guard was "having a bad day" when we didn't see a sign that the hot tub was closed for the night. Sort of threatened to kick us out. Kind of a bummer, but I don't think that's the hotel's fault.
