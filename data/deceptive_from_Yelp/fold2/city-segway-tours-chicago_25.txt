Wow, I was so impressed with our guide, Tara.  We had 4 teenage boys and 4 adults in our group.  While the boys were a handful, she never lost her cool.  We couldn't have asked for a better tour guide! The 3 hour tour was very organized, competitively priced and only our 8 family members were in our group. We saw parts of Chicago we would never have gone to.  Northerly Island was my favorite.  We also went to Grant Park, Adler Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium & Soldier Field. It's amazing how much you could see in 3 hours.   This was a memorable part of our trip to Chicago and one activity that the kids (and the adults!) will never forget.  While it was expensive for us non-city dwellers, it was no more so than the other companies out there and we definitely got our money's worth.
