This place is pretty swank and pretty pricey. The hotel itself is a smaller branch off the Hilton chain and you kind of get that standardized feel of Hilton hotels from the aura it gives you. And not the Paris Hilton feel, but the hotel feel where it's clean but very get in and get out. I thought it was a fine place to stay but I was forced here because a conference of radiologists was in town taking up all the cheaper rooms.
