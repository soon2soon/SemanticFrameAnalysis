We Â found our tour (the Signature Architecture tour) to be very interesting, especially regarding the Fine Arts Building. The tour guide spent much more time discussing the Fine Arts Building than the others; but the place is fascinating and well worth the extra attention, as was the discussion of Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Overall, the guide was very knowledgeable, and we were impressed by her insights and her enthusiasm about the history of the structures in the tour. We definitely would recommend it to anyone curious about some of the most prominent buildings on and near Michigan Avenue.
