LOOK NO FURTHER - THIS IS YOUR COMPANY TO BOOK!!! I booked a 25 passenger party bus from Chicago to South Bend, IN for a group of visiting college friends to enjoy a Notre Dame football game.  From time of reservation to day of the event, Elite Chicago Limo was amazing to work with!  It was my first time renting a vehicle for an event like this so I was weary but they didn't let us down.  I was always able to reach someone when I called and they were patient and informative when I had questions.   Driver arrived on time and the condition of the vehicle was great.  Driver (Derek) was extremely courteous and helped us load some of our gear on the bus.  He was pleasant to work with  (despite our group being a little loud and excited throughout the trip but hey, it's a party bus!) the entire trip.  While gratuity was included in my credit card payment, I felt compelled to give him a cash tip at the end of the night - he was that good! I would highly recommend Elite Chicago Limo for all of your transportation needs!
