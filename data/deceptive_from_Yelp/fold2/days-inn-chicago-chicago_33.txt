We loved this place!  The bed was huge and comfy, there was a little changing room and the bathroom had a window that you can open.  The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was adequate.  We did the hotel valet parking and always got our car very quickly. Also there is tons of stores that you can walk to from the hotel.
