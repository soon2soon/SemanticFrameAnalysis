What a refreshing experience.  I went back to visit family and friends/ wedding in Indiana and flew into Midway May 14, 2014. This was a completely different experience than 6 weeks earlier with a competitor in this same airport. I was greeted by a friendly attendant, Catlin, at the counter.  Caitlin was quick and efficient.  When I got upstairs I was met by an equally friendly Jenna who had our car waiting.  An equally pleasant surprise was an AMERICAN car was waiting for us.  Enterprise Midway has my business EVERY time from this point on.  These girls were amazing and the service exemplary.  As for their competitor a few counters down, good luck.  I tell everyone to avoid them after my experience there.
