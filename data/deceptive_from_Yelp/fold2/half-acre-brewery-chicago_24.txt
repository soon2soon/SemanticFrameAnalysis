What an awesome place! Although we showed up late for the tour, we had a great time (if you are interested in the Saturday 11am tour, it's first come first serve, so be sure to be here by 10:15 to guarantee a spot). I always enjoy a local microbrewery. The beer was clearly the best part, but the bartenders and patrons were fun, too. As an IPA guy, I recommend the Space - second favorite is the Chicago-renown Daisy Cutter. $3-$5 8oz beers. I enjoyed the music and the rustic feel of the tap room. Great way to spend a Saturday with good company.
