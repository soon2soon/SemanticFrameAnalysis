Had an bad experience with this travel agency.  Our trip was poorly planned (hotels not informed of early check-ins, birthday cake not arranged with hotel, pre-paid meal vouchers not honored by hotel etc.) and the transfer company they use stole items from our suitcases while we were not in the bus.  Costa Rica Experts took no responsibility for their sub-contractors actions and are standing behind their sub-contractor (even against  very strong evidence supported by the six people on the trip) and not the client/vacationers.  Would not recommend this agency.
