I went to Global Adrenaline's Hustler Fashion Show on Saturday and I must say it was the most repulsive show that I've ever seen. The girls were fat and half naked and it looked like they never modeled a day in their life. I could even over hear the models saying that had no idea what to do or what was going on!! Don't bother with any of their shows again!!!
