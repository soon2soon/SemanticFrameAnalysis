The hotel room was extremely clean, the bed very comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious and laid out well.  The most important thing to me was that the room was for all practical purposes silent.  We were on the eighth floor in the middle of the hall.  The hotel was sold out so I presume we had occupied rooms on both sides and above us, but we heard nothing - that's what I wanted.  The front desk/staff was also very nice/pleasant/helpful.
