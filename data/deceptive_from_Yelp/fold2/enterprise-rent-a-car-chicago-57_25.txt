What started out as great service changes the moment you need that great customer service. Every enterprise i've used in the past was fantastic. When i picked up the car at O hare airport it was quick and easy with great customer service. A week later I was rear ended while sitting at a red light. The police had the car towed and asked me to call enterprise. The customer service agent transferred me to road side assistance (which i opted not to have) This agent hung up on me when i told her that the police officer hadn't finished with his report (he was having computer issues). When I called back with the report information i was put on hold for 15 minutes. Then when I said i needed a new car because the cops had mine towed, they recommended i call a cab and go back to my hotel and call back the next day. Since it was almost 4:30, I guess Enterprise wont pick you up if its almost dinner time. The police officer  took me to the police station so i wouldnt be left on the side of the road in a city i dont live in. After calling enterprise again to try and get things taken care of, I was then yelled at for allowing the cop to have the undrivable car towed. After being on hold for another 45 minutes I was told they would send a cab to take me to the airport rental center, they gave me a confirmation # and said just give the person at the desk that number and i would have a car waiting for me.. WRONG. When i got there I was told that i would have to make a new reservation and pay a new $100 deposit.  The people were rude both in the store and on the phone. My situation wasnt resolved till 8:30 pm,  4 hours after the accident.
