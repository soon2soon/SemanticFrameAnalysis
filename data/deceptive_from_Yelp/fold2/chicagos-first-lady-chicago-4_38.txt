we had a terrible weather day but regardless, i stuck it out with my umbrella on the upper deck with a hot chocolate. hot chocolate was delicious, and the tour was good. Â  our guide was a docent from a museum - the tour was incredibly detailed. for someone with not much knowledge, i didn't need such a detailed description of every building we went by. was a great way to see the city and really enjoyed cruising, but some more stories of the city and its culture would have been nice as well, so it wasn't chalk full of dates and names of people i don't remember. would recommend this tour to architecture lovers
