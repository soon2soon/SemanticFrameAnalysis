So fun!  Five of us went to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday.  None of us had any segway experience. Nate was a great teacher.  We went from feeling timid to feeling almost like experts by the end of the tour.  This is really saying something since it was Labor Day weekend and the city was really crowded. Got to see so much of the city.  We would highly recommend!
