Hi I work with the great folks at the China Visa Service center and I am with a major International Airline. My position has meant that I have needed to request Chinese visas for crewmembers and I can very honestly say that after having done this for over 30 years - these gals and guys are clearly the VERY BEST IN THE BUSINESS!! Of all of the 'visa services' available - there are none better to work with. Â They have also recently expanded to doing visas for many countries besides China and they have proven very beneficial there even if I just need to ask a question. If I could give them 6 stars for this review - I would. They are that good!! Spence
