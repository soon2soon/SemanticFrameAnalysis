If you haven't taken the opportunity to stop into Half Acre - you're missing out. Not only does this place craft amazing beer, but the people are super friendly. You can take a brewery tour or you can opt to just hang out in front, sampling their (free) tapped beers, chatting with locals who are stopping in to get their growlers filled. Keep your eyes peeled for Half Acre options on beer lists in the city. Support local - buy local!!
