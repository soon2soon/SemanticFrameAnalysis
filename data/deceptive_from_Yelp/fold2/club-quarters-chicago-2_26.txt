As straightforward basic accommodations, this is a gem in a prime location. Â It was very clean, the staff were courteous and helpful, and the price outstanding. The room is not fancy but perfectly adequate when all you need is a place to sleep and shower but you're spending your time in town rather than in your hotel. The self check-in using kiosks was quick and easy, and frankly a better system than having to wait in line to talk to staff to check in. It's a lot like using airport kiosks to check in. Unless you have some specific need that must be met, using the machine is faster and more efficient. I would definitely stay here again.
