I chartered Chicago's Leading Lady the largest in their flight for a private reception. It was a great event for 260 people. The boat pulled right up to our hotel the Sheraton and everyone loaded right on. We hung out for a while and then cruised up the river and back again. The First Lady staff was amazing along with Captain Rich. When I got on the boat there had been a miscommunicaton on my part of the setup and they had too many tables. They immediately started clearing them and found somewhere to store them on the fly. Their staff was amazing! So friendly and flexible. I would definately use them again.
