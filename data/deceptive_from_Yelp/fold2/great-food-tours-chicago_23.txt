6 of us (including a 16-yr-old and an 8-yr-old) did the chocolate tour with Greg Fairbanks on 7/3. Great food, great guide. What we were most impressed with is that Greg knew not only about the food but about the history of some of the places we passed along the way. Well worth the $$. Would do it again!
