I am from Los Angeles and I was excited to see the wonderful architecture in Chicago. These tours do not disappoint, I highly recommend going on any of their tours. I did 3 of their tours: The Architecture and Chicago Underworld Tour with Ryan and the Frank Lloyd Wright tour with Ana. Both tour guides were fantastic. The tour guides gave us a lot of interesting information without being boring and the walks were not difficult. I learned  a lot and I got fantastic pictures to share with friends back home.  I will definitely take another tour with Chicago Savvy tours when I'm back in Chicago.
