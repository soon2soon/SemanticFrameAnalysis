This hotel is a winner. I took a trip to visit friends and stayed hear at their suggestion. Fantastic location, just a few blocks from Union Station and close to Grant Park, shopping, and all the major museums. Tons of restaurants, from fast food to fancy, within a few minutes' walk. Customer service was superb - the entire staff was friendly, enthusiastic and service-oriented. Excellent breakfast. Hotel is small but very clean. My only two minor complaints were: 1) They ran out of cut fresh fruit about an hour before the breakfast bar closed, even though on my initial trip down when the area was just opened they assured me there would be plenty of food. Had I known, I would have taken some fruit right then. 2) I clearly heard my neighbor's wake-up phone call every morning, although I admit that I never did hear my neighbor. Made me wonder what would happen if I had gotten noisy neighbors, or a family with small children, next door. I think I may have been lucky. I will definitely be back.
