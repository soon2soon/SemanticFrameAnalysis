My Mom and I had a Segway tour with Meadows from this company, and it was AWESOME!!!  It was our favorite part of our trip to Chicago.   Meadows was laid-back and fun and really helped you feel comfortable on the machines.  He took us to some cool places around the city, and we got some great pictures.  We could tell he really likes his job because he tells "extra" information about the city that one usually wouldn't find out on a normal tour.   I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago.  We had a blast and would do it again in a heartbeat!  Thanks, Meadows!
