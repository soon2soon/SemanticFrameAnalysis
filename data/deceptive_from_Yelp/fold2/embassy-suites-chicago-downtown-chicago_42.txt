My husband, my 10 month old, and I had the pleasure of staying here on our first family vacation! We had excellent service throughout the duration of our stay. Front desk staff was very helpful with directions and the bell hops went out of their way in the pouring down rain the get cabs for the dozens of people standing outside on a busy Saturday morning.     Pool is a little on the small side and the area needs more signs posted about child supervision, but it was clean and in a good location. Open bar from 5:30-7:30 on the Mezzanine.  AWESOME! This was especially good for us since we were traveling with a child and couldn't really go out, but could mingle downstairs easily.  Bar staff was knowledgeable and very friendly!     Check-in and out was a breeze.  Our room was separated into two. One room had a sink and two double beds with a TV and dresser. The other was a living area with another TV a bar with sink, fridge, and microwave, along with the bathroom and dining table.  That's a total of three sinks guys! This comes in handy when trying to keep a little one asleep while you are awake.  Breakfast was stellar and included an array of goodies like bacon, sausage, eggs, omelet bar, and much more.  Highly recommend staying here!
