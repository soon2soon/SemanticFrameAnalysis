DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT STUFF STOLEN FROM YOUR ROOM. Â I accidentally left my work iPad laying on the bed when I checked out of the hotel. When I realized I had left it I was already 4 hours away. I called the hotel and they said it was gone and the room had been cleaned. The hotel is now blaming me for leaving it instead of finding out which of their employees stole it. Good luck and I hope you take a Safe with you if you stay there.
