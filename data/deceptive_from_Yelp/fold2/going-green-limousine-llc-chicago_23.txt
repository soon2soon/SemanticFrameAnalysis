I rarely write reviews, but after receiving excellent service, I knew I had to write something.  My bosses were nervous about a somewhat complicated reservation that involved multiple pickups.  I called Green Limousine numerous times to work out the coordinates, and not only were they always nice and helpful, but to reassure us, the owner drove the car.  Needless to say, my bosses came back from their trip very impressed.  I'm from NY and I wish we had Green LImousine here!!!  BTW, their prices are very reasonable (at least for NY standards).
