I really enjoyed our stay here.  We were here for 2 nights.  We had a King Bed Suite, and the room was perfect.  It gave us a great place to spread out our stuff, we went to Trader Joe's to pick up snacks and drinks to stock the mini fridge, the sofa was great for some down time and to rest our feet after walking to Navy Pier.  I loved the suite!  The employees were friendly we had plenty of fresh towels in our room.  The pool and hot tub were not the greatest (pool was a little cold and the hot tub did not have adequate amounts of water in it to work properly) but we weren't really in Chicago to go swimming.  The Manager's Reception between 5:30-7:30 was an EXCELLENT way to start off our evenings (free drinks and appetizers - what more could you ask for???) and free breakfast in the morning was better than I expected.  Great location and clean.  Highly recommended!
