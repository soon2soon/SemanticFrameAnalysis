This is a great hotel for all of the reasons mentioned in previous reviews. My complaint is with the front desk manager.  My room was the first room right next to the elevators and lobby bar.  I heard every loudmouth as they waited for the elevator along with the noise from the bar patrons.  When I complained the next morning all the manager could do was say he was sorry.  No refunds or compensations for a miserable, sleepless night.  Nice place, but what happened to customer service? If you are given room number 531, turn around and go stay somewhere else.  This room should never be rented.
