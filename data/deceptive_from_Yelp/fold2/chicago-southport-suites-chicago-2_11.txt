What a city! Started with a Cubs game, and never stopped.  What museums this city has. And it all started with Jim giving us all the tools we need; even laundry detergent.  We could see the 'L' from our front steps which was so great.  My friends and I we so impressed, I just wish the weather was like it was in Dallas because I'd be looking for a job on Michigan Ave.  Wow!
