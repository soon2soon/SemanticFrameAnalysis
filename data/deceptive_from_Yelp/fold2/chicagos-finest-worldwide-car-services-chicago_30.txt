David DePluzer and his staff are prompt, friendly, flexible, attentive and accommodating.  They know the city and traffic patterns.  I've ridden with Dave or one of his drivers (shout out to Alan) on numerous occasions and I cannot say enough good things.   Special requests are always honored.  I have no doubt that Chicago's Finest Limousine and Car Service are truly Chicago's Finest and most professional!!
