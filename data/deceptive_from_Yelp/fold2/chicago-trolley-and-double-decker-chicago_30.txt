On 8/21/2009 we hired the Double Decker Bus Company to act as transportation for our son's wedding.  He and his bride had chosen a venue somewhat north of downtown.  With our guests mostly staying at the Blackstone Renaissance in the South Loop, arranged transportation seemed the best option.  It worked beautifully!  The drivers were fantastic, the tour guides just the best, and in both directions our choice was a hit!  Our guests loved the idea and the trip!
