I booked through Expedia.com and was pleasantly surprised at the rates.  The shuttle was waiting for us and the driver was very friendly.  Wouldn't even take our tip, as we are military.  The Rep (Kelsey) was waiting for us at the door.  We were offered a free upgrade.  Took a few minutes to get everything done.  Did not try to hard sell the insurance (I had my own, plus the extra coverage through a premium credit card).  Drop off was SO FAST!  I called before we dropped off to let them know I was going to drop off one day earlier than my original reservation, and they didn't charge me for the last day- with the expedia.com reservation, they did not have to do that.  I'm sure that they aren't perfect, but I would use them again.
