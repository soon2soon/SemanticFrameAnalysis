Great concept, thrilled that they are encouraging biking and exploring the diverse neighborhoods of Chicago.   Definitely lived up to the biking experience I expected.  Fell way short in food/cultural experience.   Disappointed in restaurants we went to.  Didn't feel they paid off the "blue plate"/diner experience, which was the theme.  First stop was interesting and in line with expectations, a cool old greasy spoon diner in Bridgeport.  But 2nd stop was just a neighborhood sandwich place in Logan Square and last place was in the middle of Michgan Avenue mania on a Saturday in the summer.  Dangerous and frustrating for riding and also lacks the expected character/culture of "blue plate" food.  If that pie spot had another location (sounds like it did), would be better to go there.   Plus I didn't think the amount/quality of food you got at stops #2 an #3 was worth $50.  Cutting up a slice of pie in a plastic container and sharing with strangers isn't an experience I'd pay that much for again.
