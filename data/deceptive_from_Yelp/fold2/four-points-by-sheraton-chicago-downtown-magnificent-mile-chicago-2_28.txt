Fantastic! Jeremy, at the front desk, was awesome. He helped us out so much and his recommendations were spot-on. The hotel is affordable & fun. They had beer-tasting everyday. One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. The location was perfect for enjoying the city. I'd stay there again in a second.
