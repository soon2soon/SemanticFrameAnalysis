Just got back from a fantastic trip to Tanzania coordinated by Global Adrenaline.  They were great during the booking and pre-trip process, and their African partners (African Endeavors for our Kilimanjaro climb and Asilia Africa for our safari) were outstanding!  Every detail was covered.  Highly recommended!
