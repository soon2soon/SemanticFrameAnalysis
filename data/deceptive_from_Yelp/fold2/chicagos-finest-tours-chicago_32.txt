I never really write reviews but had to because this tour was SOOOOOO interesting. I am not even a history fan but absolutely LOVED this tour. The history was in depth, explained Chicago from the very start....but it was not boring what so ever. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour. It was a blast. I took the Chicago History Pedway Tour...and I can't wait to take the other tours as well! Loved it that much!
