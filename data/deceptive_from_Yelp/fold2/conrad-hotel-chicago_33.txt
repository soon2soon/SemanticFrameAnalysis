This is the second time I got this Hotel using Hotwire.  I simply wanted an overnight in the loop to prevent the hassle of driving home after a late night show in the city.  What a treat to get this property for only 115.00 for the night!!!  I LOVE this hotel.  The staff is friendly and professional.  Complimentary water, WIFI, in room slippers and bathrobe, walk in separate shower, large soaking tub, buttery soft linens, HDTV flatscreen with BOSE sound system. Also, I treated myself to room service coffee.  It came delivered by a tuxedoed server on a beautiful silver tray lined with white linens.  The server gave me the weather for the day and offered to pour the coffee for me.  This is top notch. I typically use Marriott for my business travel and have Elite status with that chain.  From now on, I am switching my loyalty to Hilton.  Overall I find Hilton service and quality to outstep Marriott when comparing their various brands, Courtyard vs. Garden Inns, Basic Marriott to Basic Hilton, this property vs. Renaissance, etc.  Hilton, your affiliation with Hotwire has done it's job.  You filled a room that would have otherwise gone empty AND you won back a frequent traveler.
