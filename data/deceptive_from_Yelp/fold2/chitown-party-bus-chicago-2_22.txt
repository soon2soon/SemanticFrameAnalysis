My buddies and I rented from Chitownparty bus this last weekend and it was a wild ride. We rented the VIP party bus that has wrap around seating, 2 TV's, karaoke, disco lights, dance pole, 2 bars and a diamond plated floor. Renting from them was super easy and Mandy was super nice on the phone. I called a few other places, but all of them sounded on the shady side. Mandy was a pleasure to deal with and setting up the bus only took 10 minutes over the phone. We stayed in email contact and a day before the trip they called to go over everything and to give me the drivers contact info. The day arrived and my buddies all ready started partying before the bus arrived and when it did it was a good 15 minutes early. The driver Bill had all the addresses for the stops and we chatted about the game plan for the night. Â The rest of the night went smooth and Bill did a great job driving and dealing with my drunken friends. The driver and I stayed in contact by texting and I understood the bus couldn't park in front of the bars, so when we were ready to leave I gave him a text to pick us up. I was very happy with Chitown party bus and will definitely use them again! TIP FOR YOU ALL.....when your calling around, don't always go with the cheapest. Ask what year are there vehicles and make sure they have "real" and more then 6 pictures of the vehicle on there website. And if they sound shady...RUN!
