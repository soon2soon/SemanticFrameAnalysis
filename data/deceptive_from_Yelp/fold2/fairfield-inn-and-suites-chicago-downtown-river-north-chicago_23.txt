We really enjoyed our stay here. Room was comfortable, bathroom was very nice and big. The room was smaller than we expected. We were on the 9th floor and were never woken up by the city noise. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted and the red line was within a very short walk. For the price you can't beat the location and accommodations.
