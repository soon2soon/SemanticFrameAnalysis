We hired Elite Limos for our wedding day and they were great! Timing was a huge issue for us and they were very on time! They were the most affordable limo service I had found (and I called something like 15 limo companies before settling on Elite). They were very accommodating to our needs as a group and the limos were clean, stocked, and comfortable! The drivers were a pleasure and the rides were smooth! If ever we need a limo company again in the future we will not hesitate to hire Elite! Thank you for helping our wedding run smoothly!
