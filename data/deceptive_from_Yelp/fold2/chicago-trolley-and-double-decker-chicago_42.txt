I have lived in Chicago my entire life and thought I knew all there was to know about the city.  I was wrong! After graduating from College, my friends and I went to Chicago for a day of fun. We wanted to get around the city without having to walk miles and miles or without having to pay for a cab every 10 minutes. So we decided to hop on a Chicago Trolley.   We purchased the all-day pass so that we could get around from place to place while also learning about the great Windy City! It was amazing! The drivers were both very knowledgeable and fun to be around.  Once off the trolley, the wait was never long to get back on. I would highly recommend them to anyone visiting or currently living in Chicago. We loved every second of it!
