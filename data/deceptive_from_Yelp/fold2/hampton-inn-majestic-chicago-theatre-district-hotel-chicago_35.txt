Just returned from four nights at the lovely Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District Hotel. It was a great experience! It is located on the Magnificent Mile, plenty of good restaurants and fine shopping, the subway, and other great hotels. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. Our room was smallish, but I booked through a third-party travel site and got a great deal. I would stay there again .
