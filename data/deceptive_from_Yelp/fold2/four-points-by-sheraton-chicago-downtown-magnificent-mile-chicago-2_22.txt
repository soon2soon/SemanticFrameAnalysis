We had a great stay here this past weekend. It is a clean hotel, convenient, but the aspect that stood out to us what the helpfulness of the staff, particularly the doormen. Dante was awesome! He gave us great recommendations to nearby restaurants and things to do in the area. We'd stay here again for sure!
