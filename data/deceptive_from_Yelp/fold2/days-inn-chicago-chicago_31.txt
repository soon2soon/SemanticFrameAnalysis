Very nice staff. Very clean and quiet. Good location and the valet service was fast and efficient. Continental breakfast was pretty generic but again very clean breakfast room, attentive staff. Neat old building. Oh and we were there during Christmas and they upgraded our room to business class and it was very roomy. Even on Diversey it wasn't all that loud. We would definitely return.
