My parents came to town and not were the Cubs playing that same weekend but, something else in the city was happening where every hotel was sold out.  I had never been to the Days Inn, nor had my friends, nor had anyone else I've known.   It is cute, quaint, charming and a little rare gem in the city in E. Lakeview that I am so happy that I found.  My parents really enjoyed their stay.  And, for me, I didn't have to travel back downtown each time we got together nor did I have to give them a map of the city in hopes that they would find me each time. The rates were around $150 per night for a king size non-smoking room.  Extremely affordable.   The front desk staff were polite, friendly and accommodating.  They checking in early (11am) and I didn't think the room would be read but, it was.  The rooms were so nice:  spacious, clean, cute and charming.  My parents said the beds were extremely comfortable and that they slept really well.  The room came with continental breakfast that I didn't see but, they said was extremely plentiful with waffles, fruit, yogurt and Starbuck's coffee. If you have family coming in town please, check into the Days Inn Lakeview.  I am so happy that I found this place, that my parents loved it and that it's very convenient on the north side.
