To all Enterprise Companies: This company uses their workers and works them until they are exhausted with greater than13hr shifts for just above minimum wage! This company is pathetic! They take advantage of their workers and these workers never get rewarded for their hard work! If looking here for a job look somewhere else you will end up hating it, or quitting shortly after hire, or work until you become a walking zombie with no money to show for it. This company is very deceitful! Enterprise you really need to rethink your hiring and wages for these workers they are worth more than what you are offering in ALL aspects!
