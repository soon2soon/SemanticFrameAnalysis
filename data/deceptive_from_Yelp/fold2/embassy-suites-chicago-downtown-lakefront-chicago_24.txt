Good luck getting a correct confirmation or registration through them prior to arrival without attitude or miscommunication.  I thought i prepaid for my parents room (40h anniversary) but apparently, i was supposed to know that i needed to fill out and fax a credit card authorization form prior to them checking in.  How would i know this unless they would tell me?  I made it absolutely clear that I was booking for someone else.   When my parents went to check in they made them use their credit card and refused to charge mine -  So Embassy Suites is  okay with charging a card without a faxed authorization, just as long as you don't show up to use the room. When i asked Laura Rufo what she could do to help avoid charging my parents card for what was supposed to be a gift, she was no help - only suggesting to fax the paperwork through (sorry, i don't have access to a fax machine on a Saturday evening).  I told her that even if i did find a fax machine to clear up the issues, that the chances that they would be able to properly handle the issue on such short notice seemed unlikely, based on what had happened up until now.  "Sir, if you don't think we can handle it, don't bother sending it through"    What happened to "it's our pleasure to assist you" they pride themselves on as repeated during the 20 minutes of waiting on hold? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! NOT WITH THE TROUBLE AND CONFUSION!
