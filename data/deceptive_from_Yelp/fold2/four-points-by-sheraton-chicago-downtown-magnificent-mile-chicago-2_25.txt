This hotel has an extremely convenient location--- just 1 or 2 blocks away from famed Chicago restaurants and a few steps from Magnificent mile. With a number of other convenient hotel options around magnificent mile, this should be tops on your list due to the friendly staff. While we were there- Francis and Doug at the front desk made sure our vacation was spot on. They greeted us every time we walked by, asked us how our day was going and even recommended some top attractions. They made personal connections and made us feel more welcome. Every night, we felt like we were coming "home". Thank you, Four Points!
