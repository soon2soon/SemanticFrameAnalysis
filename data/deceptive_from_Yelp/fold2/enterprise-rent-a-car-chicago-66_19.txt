The best rental car experience I have had, Saul was there right when they opened up at 8am and had me through the paperwork and out the door in less then ten minuets. The car was clean and in great shape and they were completely up front about pricing, ie they didn't put me together with a bunch of fine print charges after the fact as some rental agencies will try to do. The best part of all of it was that Lauren called with a follow up after I had returned the car to make sure everything went swimmingly. It did, and it was a nice personal touch to round out a great experience.
