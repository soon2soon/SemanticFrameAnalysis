Half Acre has become my go-to beer. Daisy Cutter when it's cold outside, Gossamer when it's hot, and whatever specialty brew they've got going whenever that may be. My favorite specials have been the Ween-inspired Pure Guava pale ale, the Dead Milkmen-inspired Chocolate Camaro stout, and the incredible Big Hugs coffee stout. Great beer, interesting happy folks to talk to, and lord help me they're on the way home from where I work. Lucky me!
