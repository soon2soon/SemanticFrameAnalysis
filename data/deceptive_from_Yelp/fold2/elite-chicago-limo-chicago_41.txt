I can honestly say that Elite Chicago Limo is the best experience I've had with limo companies. We rented the party bus which is basically a night club on wheels, it was the perfect way to pregame before going out. The bus was on time and in perfect condition. Our driver, Paul, was super friendly and HILARIOUS! basically they helped make it a very memorable night. Thanks guys!
