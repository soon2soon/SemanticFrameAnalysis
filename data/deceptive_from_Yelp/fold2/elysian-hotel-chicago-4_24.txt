This hotel is amazing! From your first moments entering the secluded courtyard entry your experience is sure to surpass expectations. The friendly ambassadors that greet you ensure all of your needs are met. From offering a car wash to showing you the ins and outs of your hotel room to include the standard in room fire place the ambassadors help ensure you are comfortable with your stay. Not only are the public areas of the hotels gorgeously decorated but the rooms are equally amazing. We stayed in just the King room, but this is no standard room. Tons of space, the amenities included a large sitting area with fireplace and flat screen TV, and lovely desk. The bedroom area has another flat screen TV and cool ipod docking station, and is outfitted with beautiful linens. There is a dressing area and a huge bathroom with over-sized tub, his and her sinks, in-mirror TV, separate toilet and walk in shower. No detail has been missed.
