I reserved a Range Rover for a special weekend trip. The day before it was to be delivered, Charlie called me to say that in fact, the car I'd reserved a week earlier was not actually available and tried to put me in a different car. He wasn't the least bit apologetic, probably because it was his plan all along. I would not deal with them again under any circumstances. It seems to be an odd combination of luxury vehicles and shabby customer service.
