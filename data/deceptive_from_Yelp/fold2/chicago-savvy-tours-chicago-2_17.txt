This was my first walking architectural tour and I had a really, really good time! Our guide was Allison and she very laid back and knowledgeable of the sites we saw. She provided a bunch of interesting and random facts and now whenever I am downtown, I think about everything I learned when I look at the buildings! Great time, excited for more tours in the future.
