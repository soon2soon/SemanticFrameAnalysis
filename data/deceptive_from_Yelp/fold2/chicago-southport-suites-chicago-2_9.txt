Southport Suites is a great place to stay!  It is close to everything and extremely convenient to the CTA (train).  The garage helps tremendously for parking and the Suite comes with everything you need when on vacation, they even supplied us with a pack-and-play for our little one!  I highly recommend this Suite and will definitely stay here again!
