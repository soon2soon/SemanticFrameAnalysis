Our cupcake tour was little more than a guide leading us from one bakery to the next. If you were to just visit the same places on your own and buy yourself any cupcake you want, you'd spend less and accomplish the mission in half the time. Some places don't even allow you inside since they're so small, so you eat the cupcake outside on the sidewalk. The tour included essentially no interesting tidbits or anything like that.
