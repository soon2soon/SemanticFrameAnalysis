Great tour!  We have been on segways before in Florida and it was alot of fun this go around also.  Beth was a great guide - we did the 3 hour tour.  Caution - Took our 12 year old  who loved just riding the segway but got a little bored with the tour part - she would rather have been able to ride around and not learn about anything!  The 2 hour tour probably would have been better for her, but we loved it!
