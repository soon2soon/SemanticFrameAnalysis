SEE CHICAGO FROM THE TOP of a Chicago Trolley Double Decker! I've lived in the Chicago area all my life, so thought a "sightseeing tour" was only for visitors. Boy was I wrong! After my first experience in '07, I'm hooked! It's now my FAVORITE thing to do every summer! This is the BEST WAY TO SEE CHICAGO while avoiding expensive parking & hassling with traffic. One pass allows you to hop on & off all day long, stopping at 13 attractions. They offer friendly service, clean vehicles & tour guides with an endless knowledge of city trivia. Also included is a free t-shirt, Hershey bar & popcorn! Â So sit back, relax, & enjoy viewing our magnificent City of Chicago from THE TOP!
