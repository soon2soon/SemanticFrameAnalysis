A few months back we used Chicago's Finest when heading to to the ball park for a game during the Stanley Cup Finals. Our driver was great and picked us up from our meet location, dealt with our shenanigans along the way, and got us there on time. On the way back he was right where he said he would be and drove all of us home. Their limos are clean, new, up to date, and set at the perfect temperature and did I mention drinks were provided both ways! Going with Chicago's Finest kept us safe that night, and made a good night, a great one.
