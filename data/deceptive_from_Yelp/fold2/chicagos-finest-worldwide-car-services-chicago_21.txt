The gentlemen at this limo service are the best! They were professional, pleasant, timely and reasonable in cost. They even went over and above to return a drivers license I had left in the car, in time for me to check in and be on my flight on time the next day. I would recommend them to anyone, corporate or individual if they want to be assured of on time pickup and arrival, enjoy the best in customer service and at a competitive rate. When in Chicago, I will use absolutely no other ride service, ever. I am helping all of my business partnerships become acquainted with this company as well, so they too can see what car services can and should be like!
