they hold the money from your account until you return the car... well that's what they said but is not true they hold 250.00 for 10 days after we return the car" because a mistake" they said. isn't that crazy! we couldn't pay the rent because someone else mistake. when we call the associate was rude and hung up the phone, they would not listen what is our concern about the situation and that we need to resolve the issue. very disappointed!!!
