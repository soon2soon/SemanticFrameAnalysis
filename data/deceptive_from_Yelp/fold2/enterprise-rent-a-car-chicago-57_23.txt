One thing you have to watch out is the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or auto insurance.  They are $16 to $20 a day.  Even after we told the agent we did not want CDW, the agent still entered it in the system and point to the wrong area for us to initial.  They don't not cycle the box anymore.  They do not want to leave any trail of their mistakes Enterprise is very bad on this.  They push very hard and con you to take the insurance.  They are making a lot of money on that.  Watch Out for Enterprise or avoid Enterprise To avoid the scam: 1) Ask the agent to cycle the boxes he want you to initial. 2) Read carefully 3) write down some place in the contract- " No CDW" ,  initial to indicate you do not want the insurance.   Have the agent initial it, if you can.
