First of all, NEVER stay at this hotel for New Years Eve. Upon checking in, we learned that we needed to have a wristband in order to come back into the hotel after 7pm New Years Eve night. This was not a big deal until they told us that we would have to pay an extra 40 dollars for our other occupants in the room for them to have a wristband as well. I booked a double bed room with a maximum occupancy of 4 people. The front desk however said that my reservation was only for 2, but no where did it say this on my confirmation e-mail. The lady kindly said that if I could show her the confirmation they would "see" what they could do after speaking with a manager. When I went back down to speak with them they had ALREADY charged my card the $40.00, and told me that it didn't matter what my confirmation had said. They also told me that I could not have my family in the room with us to get ready for New Years Eve (even though they would be staying at a different hotel and would only be getting ready with us), and that we HAD to leave the hotel by 8:30. They would be sending a manager to make sure we left otherwise they were going to charge ANOTHER $40.00 for my 2 family members being in the room. They also told me that no "partying" is allowed per Chicago law, and I've never felt so insulted as they presumed we would simply be "partying". I WILL NEVER be staying at this hotel again for a Chicago stay. So save yourself the time, money, and humility, and go to the Marriott around the block.
