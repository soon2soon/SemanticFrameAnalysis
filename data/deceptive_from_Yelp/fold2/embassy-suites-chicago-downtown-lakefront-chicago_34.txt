We arrived and there was no early check in available, still she was apologetic at the desk.  A good introduction to what our stay was going to be like.  We arrived and enjoyed the Managers reception, had a great cocktail and great information from the helpful barkeeper.  The next day, though, we received a mediocre cocktail (at best) and a bit of an attitude.  It was like every time something nice happened it would be followed by an experience with staff that was less than acceptable.   The experience of having to force the housekeeper out of the room, when my family was trying to change, was the last straw though.  However, when we contacted the manager she was very interested in the details of our experience and eager to do whatever she could to resolve the negative experiences.  Then when I had an emergency meeting I had to attend shortly after checkout for work they were very accommodating in allowing us to stay a few hours longer, (for a modest fee). So if you are looking for spacious rooms with a door seperating the bedroom from the living room (or 2nd bedroom depending on how you look at it), in a great location, with a good complimentary breakfast and the amenities you expect from Embassy Suites this a great choice.  Clean and family friendly.  However, do not expect the sort of amazing service you would look for at more upscale hotels.  Great hotel for what it is.
