I took the Pedway tour during the week and came away with so much information  that after 40 years of living in Chicago, I had never heard before!     Dan, the leader was excellent, very informative and knowledgable , and very entertaining. The notebook with tabbed pictures and maps to go along with each stop added to understanding.   I would strongly recommend this tour to anyone including native Chicagoans!
