Found a Groupon for the Cupcake tour. It was my friends birthday and we thought that this would be a really fun experience. We both live in Chicago but had no idea of the great cupcake culture that was right outside our front doors. After taking the Great Foods Cupcake tour with Seth, we still don't. Seth was alright as far as a tour guide goes. He was very friendly and really tried to make the tour a good experience for the group. However, we did not really learn anything about each of the places we visited. Seth said maybe one or two sentences about each location. Most of the tour was spent on him sharing information about the Chicago area itself. The cupcake tasting itself was disappointing at best. We were given bite size samples from 5 places (not the 6 advertised. We did not go to the Goddess and the Grocer). What made my group really sad, was that we could have bought multiple cupcakes at each of the 5 locations and still not have paid the $80.00 we gave to attend this tour, and we did not pay full price. Considering that we learned next to nothing about the confectioneries we visited and paid $80 for the equivalent of 4 cupcakes, I can not rate this experience any higher than 1 star. It is just not worth the money spent. If you are considering this tour in future, consider taking the advise of many of the other reviewers on this page. Look at the list of places the tour visits and go yourself. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you.
