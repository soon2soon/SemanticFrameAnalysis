We had an excellent experience with Green Limousine. I reserved a car while I was out of town, to pick up my elderly Aunt for her trip to a family wedding. She's not a frequent traveler, so she was worried about everything, getting to the airport, if the car was late, missing her flight, etc. Rebecca made sure everything went smoothly. For her return trip, we asked for the driver to meet her inside the airport to help with her baggage, etc. and despite her flight being delayed over an hour, the driver was waiting there for her. She was so pleased. Our experience could not have been better. I've used another company for many years, but felt that my Aunt needed special treatment that they wouldn't provide. Yelp reviews for Green were so positive, i decided to take the leap of faith. After our experience with Green, they are now the only car service I will ever use. Thanks for making my Aunt's experience a pleasure. I look forward to using the service myself.
