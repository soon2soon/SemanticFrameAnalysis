I have used several of the Enterprise locations, but I prefer the 10 E. Grand location as the staff is kind, professional, friendly and efficient.  The cars are always clean and neat, and they have a great selection.  The staff is warm and friendly, and they are most helpful.  I have rented from other companies, but they do not have the clean cars and friendly staff which you find at the Enterprise company.
