I went down to the fitness center with my key.  The key didn't work to get into the fitness center.  Went to the front desk and she snatched it away and said that a security guard would have to accompany me to my room to verify that I was indeed staying at this hotel.  We went up to the room and he nearly pushed me over to go into the room first.  He tried to grab my wallet but I got it first and showed him my identification.  He apoligized and asked me if I wanted to speak with his supervisor.  I said no but I will write a review on Yelp.  JERKS!!!!!!!!  Don't stay here.
