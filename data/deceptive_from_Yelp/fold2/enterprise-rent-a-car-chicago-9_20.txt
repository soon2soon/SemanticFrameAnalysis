I was quoted $22.75 per day for a rental, but my insurance company would only pay $20 per day. No big deal,  I'll cover the extra $2.75 per day.  However, they charged me for a full day on the day I returned the car at 8am, exactly when they opened. This was unfair since thy will probably send the car right back out on the street with someone else. Also, they charged me $1.25 per day for something called "IL Vehicle License Cost." They deceptively put this charge in the tax section of the bill, but buying license plates for their cars is simply part of the cost of them operating their business. This is like hotels charging you extra for the electricity in the room, it's just a way to artifically quote a lower price at the front end, then surprise you with add-on fees and try to fool you into thinking it's a government imposed tax. While I was there, a woman came in to return her rental, and told the staff she received a ticket while she had the car, because the vehicle had expired plates! I wonder how she felt about paying the extra $1.25 per day hidden fee?
