Convenient location between Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile shopping. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance, which is nice since Fairfield does not have any onsite restaurants or bar, and also lacks a sundry shop. The complimentary breakfast is sufficient, though the space can quickly become overcrowded with families who choose this property for matters of space, price and location. The rooms were clean and the staff helpful so no complaints there. This is an older, converted property, so room layout will vary, particularly the bathrooms. Mine had a very awkward design with the dreaded toilet paper rolls on the wall behind the toilet. What is the deal with that anyway? Even seeing that in newer properties these days.
