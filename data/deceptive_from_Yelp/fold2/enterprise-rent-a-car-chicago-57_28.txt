I have rented cars for 20 years regularly as I travel a lot for work and pleasure. I have never had a problem. I do not usually bother with online reviews, but felt I should warn others considering Enterprise Rent a Car at Chicago's O'Hare airport. I arrived to pick up my small rental car and the employee tried to rent me several large, more expensive cars despite the fact that I had one bag and was alone. He checked the car and said everything looked fine and I drove off for a week of business in downtown Chicago. Upon return this evening the guy claimed to have found two dents on the bottom edge of the front side behind the right front wheel. He had to get down on this knees and align with the evening sun to point two quarter-sized faint dents to me. I did not car ding or in anyway mistreat this car. Of course there was no record of previous damage because the slick salesman a week earlier was too busy trying to up-sell me a BMW SUV... The manager was consulted and was just rude to me and refused to be reasonable. Reason states that driving in downtown Chicago involves normal wear and tear - and these supposed dents you could not even see. IF YOU HAVE OTHER CHOICES - AND YOU DO - DO NOT USE ENTERPRISE AT CHICAGO O'HARE. Hoping to save fellow travelers some heart-ache.
