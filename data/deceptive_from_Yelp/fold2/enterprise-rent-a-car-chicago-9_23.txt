My car was in the shop so I had to rent a car from Enterprise. I really like that they come pick you up, because it can be a hassle getting to their office. I've never had to rent from them in Chicago, but when I've rented in other cities they've always been very professional and they were very nice and professional here too. The car was really nice and clean. No problems returning it.
