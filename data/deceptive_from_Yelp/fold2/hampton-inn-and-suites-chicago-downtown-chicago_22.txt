Our family of 4 stayed her for 4 days and it was a nice clean place. Rooms were nothing fancy or huge we had 2 double beds and a desk and recliner, Tv was like 36 inch flat screen and was nice. The staff was all friendly and helpful with anything we needed. The breakfast was OMG it was so nice you had all kinds of food and it was on from 6-10 plenty of time to get food. They never ran out and it was free.The only complaint I would say is the cost of parking. Maybe I am just a small town boy but I have never paid for parking at the place I am staying at.We had to pay $42.00 a night on top of the hotel cost to park our car. I think that is not right. If you stay there a the hotel it should be included not some extra cost. So when you book your stay and are expecting to get say $90.00 a night guess again at check in time. BAM "Sir Parking is $42.00 a night" Really nice.Some people I read have complained about the Fire station next door but I never heard a thing. They do offer free ear plugs if noise does bother you.
