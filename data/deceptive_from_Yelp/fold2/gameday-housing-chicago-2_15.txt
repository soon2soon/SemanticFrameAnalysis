We too are homeowners in Ann Arbor (apparently the same as Ellen's town) that rent our home through GameDay Housing. We have NEVER had an experience like Ellen mentions and we know several other homeowners in this area that rent through GameDay and have NEVER heard of this situation either. We've never had any issues w/ renting through GameDay and the only thing that's ever been out of place upon our return is a pan w/ a few ravioli that was forgotten on the counter. If we've ever had a question or concern regarding our rentals or renters, we simply call the GameDay office and it's answered/handled immediately. I find it hard to believe that if you actually had an experience like this Ellen, that you contacted the company to discuss it. I'm guessing you are a competitor or someone with a grudge for some other reason. We LOVE renting our home through GameDay so much so, that my parents listed their home in another Big Ten town and they too have only had superb service and experiences with all of their rentals. Between our two households, we've probably had 15-20 rentals through GameDay and nothing has ever been wrong.
