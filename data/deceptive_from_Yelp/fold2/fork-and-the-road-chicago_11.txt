Hands down, one of the most fun - and filling - Saturdays!  I just took the Sweet Home Chicago Tour - 4 stops over 20 miles.  And I should've ridden another 20 miles to burn off more of the incredibly decadent desserts we sampled:  european pastries and chocolates, homemade artisanal gelatos/sorbet, mediterranean sweets (best baklava) and finally 3 kinds of pie to finish out the day.  Co-owners Dimitra and Sharon made it all the better with their vast history or tidbits about the food we tasted - they are true foodies and want to share their knowledge/passion through these tours.  Whether you are a Chicago native or a tourist, you will get to bike through new neighborhoods, try new places to eat, and go home with a full and happy belly.  I can't wait for the next tour - just can't decide if it will be bbq, dumplings, mediterranean, but after today, I can't possibly make a bad pick!
