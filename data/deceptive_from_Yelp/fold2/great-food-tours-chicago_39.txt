Cupcake tour- west town bakery, scared grounds( water tower place ), l'appiteo for gelato, sprinkles and more cupcakes Just went this past weekend. Since I live in the suburbs, i figured it would be a fun to do with my mom for her birthday. We got in through groupon so the price wasnt horrible. Lucky for us it was a great sunny day and weather was perfect. Our tour guy whos name i dont even remember was not good at all. He was nice but didn't give us much if any info on any of the cupcake places we went to. I found it very unprofessional that he was shopping for himself at each of these stops and we had to wait for him to buy his food. There was not much interaction with our group at all. The cupcakes we tried were very good but i do agree i could have bought full size cupcakes for myself and split them with my mom and spend about the same if not less. I was however taken back when he said tips are appreciated at the end of the tour. A tip for what, you didnt tell us anything we couldnt look up ourselves nor did you interact enough with the group. I talked to my mom the whole time. I ended up spending almost as much money as the tour buying cupcakes to bring home from MORE cupcakes which was our last stop. It was an eh time. I might try another tour again if there is a good deal. But i wouldn't purchase it for full price.
