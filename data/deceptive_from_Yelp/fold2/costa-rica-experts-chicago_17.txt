I highly recommend Costa Rica Experts.  My husband and I booked air travel, private drives, accommodations and activities through CRE and were very impressed with their service and the itinerary put together for us.  We had a few revisions and Aaron worked with me to put together a great trip in the budget we wanted.  We had no problems at all with any of the plans while in CR and all of the places were very clean, great service and food. We stayed at Finca Rosa Blanca, Tabacon and Aguila de Osa.  CRE is very knowledgable about CR and it was a pleasure to work with Aaron.
