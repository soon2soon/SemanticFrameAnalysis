Went to Bloomingdale, to attend a class reunion for the weekend. On Sunday, 10 of us decided to take a city tour and a friend recommended Guideline Tours. We had the most wonderful time. Costa Rica Experts  our tour guide was awesome, really well informed and entertaining. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the tour that if I am in Bloomingdale,  again, I will take another one of tours that they offer.
