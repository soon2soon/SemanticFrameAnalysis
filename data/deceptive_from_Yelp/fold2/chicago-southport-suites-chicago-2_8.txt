Thanks Jim, SouthPort Suite made our trip to Chicago complete. The decor. is very nice & each room has a comfy feel to it! We walked & took the EL, no need for a car. For such a big city Chicago is really easy to get around! Southport Ave. is a really neat area. We enjoyed eating at Leos Coney Island across the street, lot's to choose from on the menu. Lips Asian Sushi Bar, very good. Dagastinos Pizza, yummy! The tour of Wrigley Field was great & so was the game, Cubs won 14-7!!! Downtown we did the Hop ON Hop Off Trolley & DoubleDecker bus, great price for 3 days! Also did the Architecture River Cruise, so many interesting Buildings in Chi-town! We felt safe everywhere we went & loved it. Will have to make a return trip, still so much to see!!! Thanks Again - Ricky & Michele Chandler
