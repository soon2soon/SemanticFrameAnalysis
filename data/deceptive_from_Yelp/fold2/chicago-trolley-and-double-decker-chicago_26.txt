I loved, loved, LOVED this experience!  Now I've grown up around Chicago and I know my way and such, but this was a great, inexpensive way to really see the city.  Our tour guide was great, the weather was fantastic and time just flew by. I love that you jump on and off whenever you want and in terms of bang for your buck?  It's great! Not just for tourists.  Chicagoans should do this ride as well and you really get an appreciation for the city.
