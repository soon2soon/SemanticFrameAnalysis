I rented a porsche boxter a few weeks ago from this company. They called the day of and said it was not up to their standards and could not rent it out for the day. They offered me a corvette or an esaclade for the same price. I was not happy with my selection so they offered me an upgrade to a 911, but at an additional cost. We also had to go pick up the car cause they only offer free delivery to a small radius within the city. Overall I was very happy with the car, it was great to drive and luckily had it during some good weather so we could use it with the top down. We enjoyed driving it so much that we went over our miles by 60. This was a great present and great service by Global Exotic Car Rentals, but quite a pricey item for just one day. I would recommend to rent the car for a longer period of time (cheaper price) and purchase extra miles in advance because you can get a discount that way.
