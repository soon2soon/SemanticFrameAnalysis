Took the Great Food Tour on 6/29/14 at 2pm.  Jason was our tour guide and gave interesting facts about each location as well as surrounding locations which was an added bonus.  I heard comments that he should of gave more information about places in Chicago, but this is a food tour not a around Chicago tour. Jason also informed group about upcoming tours. The tastings were excellent. The locations were great.  Everyone was friendly and I can't wait to take more tours offered by Great Food Tours.
