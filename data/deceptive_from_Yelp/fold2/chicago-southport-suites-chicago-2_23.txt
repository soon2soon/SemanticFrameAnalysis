You couldn't ask for a better location, just steps from shopping, restaurants, and nightlife. While the area stays busy late, it was never too loud for us. We stayed here with our two young children and found the neighborhood and its residents to be very kid-friendly, with nearby playgrounds and even an ice cream shop a few doors down. The home is nicely designed and comes with everything one would need--and it's wonderful to have both outdoor space and a garage. There is excellent access to the El, making getting downtown or anywhre else quick and easy. The suite management was great throughout, very responsive and attentive. Overall a great choice for a stay in Chicago.
