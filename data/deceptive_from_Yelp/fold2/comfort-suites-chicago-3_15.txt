Overall, a great experience, for my partner and I.  We recommend and will be back.  Excellent for work travel stays.  Especially great for locals with family in town who might not want to join them out on the town for the weekend nights.  A great retreat from the hustle of the city.   We pulled up and were a little bit thrown off with the location of valet services.  Once we found that it was the same service as the Hard Rock Hotel, whose valet service is not very proactive about helping guests, we were good to go.   Upon checking in we were greeted by a friendly hostess who was able to quickly check us in despite handling multiple phone calls.  We got to our room and found it to be very homey for a hotel.  (Not to be interpretted as cramped).  We were pleased to find a clean refrigerator/freezer which was key as we brought home ice cream and left overs from dinner. The hotel is located close to many great dining establishments and in short walking distance to the River North/State Street night life scene.   Additionally, we had used a gift certificate and Patrick was wonderful to work with.  We needed to split the certificate into (2) 1-night stays and he was able to make it happen with no fuss.  Another example of employees at this hotel able and willing to help all their guests. All in all, we were very pleased.
