The designs of it loby areas are really worth giving a nice look. the staff was very courteous, and very helpful and cooperative, as we had reached the hotel but still they had the room ready for us. Inroom dining quality was quite good, and so was the morning breakfast's . if you want to stay in the Chicago, IL Â area, this hotel is my strong recomendation.
