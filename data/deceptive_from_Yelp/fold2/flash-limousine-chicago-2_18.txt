I have been using FlashLimo for the airport transportation for almost 2 years. Once or twice a month I book a sedan to drive me to the O'hare international airport. FlasLimo are always on time, they track my flights and even when the flight is delayed the car is always waiting for me. I have also used their stretch limousines for my family events and I have to say they anticipate my every need and they have made me look and feel like a VIP every time!
