We lucked out finding this hotel....we were looking for a Marriott affiliation downtown for a family of five, sight-seeing for a few days......received an e-mail from Matt at the hotel days in advance welcoming us and asking if we needed any help with planning or any special requests....I asked for a special treat for my 8-year old daughter who would be celebrating her bday during our stay........He responded in 15 minutes to the email and had a great basket of treats sent up while we were touring...he also followed up with suggestions for meals in the neighborhood that the kids would enjoy....staff could not have been nicer....hotel was clean, within easy walking distance of Grant Park, Millennium Park, and most sites downtown.....thanks Matt!!!!!!!
