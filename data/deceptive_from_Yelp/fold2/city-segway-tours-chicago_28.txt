Great family experience, I would recommend it to families with teenagers. The instruction was good, our guide (Kelsey) was great, and the equipment sound. This was our first Segway experience and after a brief and thorough introduction and one on one help, we felt confident as we began the trip. Wonderful trip filled with great views and plenty of photo op's. Highly recommend and look forward to opportunity in other cities.
