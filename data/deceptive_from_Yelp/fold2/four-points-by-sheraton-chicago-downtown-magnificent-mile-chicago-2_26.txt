We got this hotel on a Groupon deal and it was an absolutely awesome find. Excellent location a little off Michigan Avenue, convenient to shopping, tourist attractions, and public transportation, but away from the bustle. Also, BONUS, it's right around the corner from a Trader Joe's. The bed was fantastic, and I usually hate hotel beds. Firm and kept movement disturbances to a minimum. The staff were young, friendly, and professional. My boy was sad the pool was only 3 1/2 feet deep, but he still had fun. My husband was sad about the breakfast situation too. But really, it was an outstanding place.
