I like resorts but hotel was decent for a weekend getaway! If you like cookies you get 2 freshly baked chocolate chip at check in! Hotel was in heart of downtown so central to a lot of good spots. However, you still need a car unless you just want to stay in hotel and walk around the block. Nice steakhouse but there are many good food choices in Chicago!
