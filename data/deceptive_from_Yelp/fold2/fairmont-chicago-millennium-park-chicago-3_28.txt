I stayed here for a weekend with my boyfriend.  It was my first time in Chicago, and the location was great, a short walk to Magnificent Mile and right next to Millennium Park!  Our room was on the top floor which was very nice, and the room itself was nice, pretty average.  The two complaints I do have were the bathroom.  First, the toilet didn't seem to be cleaned, because there was urine on the seat when we first got into the room.  Second, there was NO water pressure in the shower and at times the water would stop coming out of the shower completely, making it close to impossible to rinse any soap off your body and completely impossible to wash your hair.
