We did the cupcake tour and even with the Groupon we purchased, we were very disappointed.  Basically, we paid for the cupcake places to have us visit their store.  Can't get better advertising than that!  The cupcakes were miniscule and one place we had gelato on a cupcake tour?   I was glad for the exercise, but we walked - a lot - for very little reward. On a positive note, Seth Davis - our guide - was funny, engaging, interesting, and concerned.  He was upbeat and seemed to enjoy what he was doing, as well as, making sure that the people on his tour were having a good time. He also made sure the group stayed together even in the midst of crowded Chicago.  We also were introduced to some very good cupcake places, with Sprinkles being the best.  We have returned to a couple of them since.   If you decide to take the tour, try to get into Seth Davis' group!
