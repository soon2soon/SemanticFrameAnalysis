We took the Architectural Foundation Boat Tour in July and we have done this 2 times before.  We absolutely love the boat ride on the river and the tour guides are always fantastic!  Our most recent docent Dick Clark was knowledgeable, fun,  and a great lecturer.  Can't say enough great things about these tours.
