Wherever we travel & if a City Segway Tour is available, we go. Our latest was Chicago and the company was fabulous as always. Kelsey, our tour guide, was loads of fun. It was my first visit to Chicago so I was keenly interested in learning about the city and Kelsey was A+ with that. I didn't realize how beautiful Chicago is. Taking the tour the first day we were there gave us a chance to check out places we wanted to investigate further. Equipment is well maintained and riding a Segway is just plain fun. The company is very professional yet relaxed & fun which I consider a very good thing. If you've never ridden a Segway before, it takes about 5 minutes to get used to it and they teach you all you need to know before your tour begins. Go for it. You'll love it! Highly recommend this company!!
