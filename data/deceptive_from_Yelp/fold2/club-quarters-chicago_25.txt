I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel.  The location is great, nice view of the river.  The rooms aren't huge but not tiny and my room was very clean, the entire hotel was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful.  They do use every inch in the room, smaller TV but I'm not there to watch TV and the bathroom is updated with a shower only, but a decent size bathroom.  The Italian restaurant connected to the hotel was really nice, we had a drink and an appetizer.  I really enjoyed our stay.
