I recently used Flash Limousine for my sisters bachelorette party and was so happy with everything!! I called a month before the event and Shana was beyond helpful from the start, getting back to me right away via email and phone. The day of the event the bus was late because of a flat tire but they let me know of the situation and extended my time! So happy with them! Will definitely be calling them for my next event!
