It was our last tourist activity in Chicago before heading home........ I am so glad we didn't miss it. Â In a very informative and laid back setting our docent Leslie did a wonderful job of narrating our voyage down the Chicago River. This was worth every penny of the $40 fee........ Would do it again if I return to Chicago.
