Nice place -- very very roomy.  Huge closet, should have lost some of the closet to make the bathroom bigger.  Toilet was very low and tiny.  Someone who was larger would have a heck of a time or have to sit on the toilet sideways.  I'm not kidding.  Anyhow, linens were changed daily which was a treat, breakfast was adequate, nothing special, but certainly no complaints.  We were to have had a room on a higher floor but when we checked in around 5:30 it still wasn't ready so we settled on a lower floor.  The views were still great but the windows do need to be changed as the seal broke, as they do and there was condensation buildup inside that sort of blocked the view a little.  A nice little feature was the venting windows on the sides of the large one.  It was great to be able to crack them open and get a little fresh air in to circulate a little.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, parking was a pain, but give me a city where it isn't.  Steps away from attractions make it a worthwhile place to stay again without second thought!
