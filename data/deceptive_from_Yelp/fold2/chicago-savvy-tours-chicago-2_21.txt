George with Chicago Savvy Tours is incredible.  We plan to go on every tour he offers--next time we'll be "threepeaters!"  His easy manner and diverse knowledge of not only architecture but juicy Chicago history makes every tour a real treat.  We've visited Chicago many times and have been on other tours--let me just say George is more than a cut above the rest.  We won't be using any other tour companies from now on.  Book a tour with him and I promise you won't be disappointed.
