This is the place to stay for Cub fans headed to wrigley.. We have stayed there at least 3 times and the staff goes out of it's way to please . It is located near some great restaurants/clubs . Make your reservations well in advance as this place fills up fast .( when Cubs are at home ) Â They offer a nice breakfast in the morning and the rooms have always been clean . we will be sure to stay here again . You have to remember that this property is older I would guess built around 1925 or so . It is a value thats why it fills up fast .....Remember this is not 5 stat property nor does it try to be ....Walking distance to Wrigley Field.
