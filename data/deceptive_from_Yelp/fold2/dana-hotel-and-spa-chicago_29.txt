For the price, location and overall quality of the hotel; I think this place is fantastic.  I'd give it 5 stars, but a few things ticked me off, very slightly, during our stay.  For one, it was like a miracle when cold or even luke warm water came out of our faucet.  It was warm to hot at all times; which stunk when brushing teeth etc.  Also, it took about 2 days and 4 trips to the front desk for them to finally fix my remote control which did not work with my TV.  Both are not that big of a deal but enough to knock it down from 5 stars.  I'd stay here again and probably will. The restaurant downstairs had awesome food and it's a shame it's not busier than what it was.  It's very industrial/modern looking, which  was nice on the inside but the outside cafe/garden area looked cold and uninviting.  I wish more people ate there than what we saw.  If you stay, give it a try.  Their breakfast is really really well done and well priced.  The room service was prompt and really well prepared as well.  The spa was shockingly awesome.  I've had horrible experiences at hotel spa's but they have it right.  My wife got a facial and pedi and I got a deep tissue massage.  Kim, my therapist, has hands like a union steelworker.  I'm sure she's awesome at light pressure massages but she was outstanding and really worked me out.  My wife also raved about her treatments as well.     The door guys were all cool, the staff was friendly without being fake and the rooms were very nice.  Staff said hello to us on the elevators and halls and made us feel welcome. The bedding is soft, way different from my memory foam at home, but I slept like a cherub.  The location is simply awesome.  Your kind of close to everything.  The Dana is a great place and they are doing good things.  Stay here if you're considering it.
