I have been a lifelong Chicagoan, but have never actually taken this tour until this past weekend and I must say it was great.  Our tour guide was named Dick, and besides being freakishly knowledgeable, he was entertaining and funny too.  The tour lasted one and a half hours, which to me was the perfect amount of time.  Having cocktails being served below was a nice touch.  At the end of our tour, the guide refused to accept any kind of gratuities, but said if you liked it, just review us on yelp.  So here I am posting a review.  I have never posted a review  for anything I've purchased before, but this tour was that good.
