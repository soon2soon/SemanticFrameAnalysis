Recently I had the pleasure of enjoying the sites and sounds of Chicago.  My mom was coming for out of town so I thought I would show her the city.  We  were going to tackle the city by walking around with a map/guid and see what I can find but along the way I was given a leaflet about the Chicago Trolley & Double Decker tours.  At first glance I wasn't going to go but after listening to the very cheerful sales agent I gave in and was on my way.  What sold me were all the great bonuses, like heresy bar, garrets popcorn and another tour that takes you out of the downtown area into near ethnic neighborhoods.   The tour itself was wonderful.  It really hit all the major attractions i.e. Millennium Park, Sears Tower, Museum Campus, etc.  Not only did it take me to these attractions it allowed me to get off and get lost for a little, then later get on board to continue my tour.  So in retrospect not only was it a tour but also a means of transportation, which saved me on my travel budget.  But the best part of the experience were the very knowledgeable tour guides giving the information.  They always seemed to know the answer to my question before I even asked it, particular Claudette who seemed to know all the famous Chicagoan that ever lived.  I would not change anything at all.  I would highly recommend this to everyone looking to get the most of the city.  But beware there is a competitor company, Grayline, that seems to offer the same tour but without all the extras and vehicle numbers.  I was talking to one of their passengers and they shared with me that my company already had 4 vehicles come by before she even got her one.
