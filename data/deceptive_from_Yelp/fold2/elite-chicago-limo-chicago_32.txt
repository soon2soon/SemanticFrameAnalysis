the best limo service ever!!!!   we rented the 26 passenger party bus and the service i received from my first email to the pick-up to the drop off was absolutely phenomenal!!!!   we were a little leary reading the reviews but decided to go with it in hopes that we would have a great outcome and thank god we did!!!   the party bus was so beautiful, super clean and the price was really unbelievable!   our driver "derrick" - best driver ever!! he took us to our house, to the store, to the club, to the hotel, back to the city - talk about unlimited stops & unlimited mileage!! what a trooper!! thanks so so much for making my 53rd birthday a blast with such great memories!! i will be referring this company to all my friends and family - we will be contacting you again thanks so much aidas & elite!!!
