Thieves!  Made the mistake of leaving my cellphone in my car as I was valeting the car. 12 hours later I come back - no phone.  Management completely indifferent. Issue remains unresolved.  Maybe it's my own stupid fault but at $60 per night for parking you would think you would be able to trust them w your vehicle and personal property
