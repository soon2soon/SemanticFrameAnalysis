Hotel was great. The rooms were a little dirty(dusty light fixtures, cobwebs in the corners). When we originally booked the hotel we read that they had free breakfast. LIE there is no free breakfast. Very close to the magnificent mile. Great food options near by including Hard Rock and Rainforest. Walking to Navy Pier is just a short walk to the east. Free Wifi and a pool. The pool is only 3 1/2 feet at the deepest point. The floor of the pool also shakes as people walk on it.
