My husband and I had a great experience with Echo. Our departing flight was out of O'Hare, and our return flight was into Midway, so I knew our best option for ground transportation was either a taxi or a car service. Living on the southside of Chicago, I was nervous about a taxi driver not wanting to go past Hyde Park. So, a car service was our best bet and we selected Echo. From booking the reservation to getting dropped off at the airport, our experience was nothing but positive. I cannot remember our driver's name, but she was great. She arrived early and was completely professional. We will definitely use Echo again as well as recommend them to others.
