Stayed here last month for a work trip.  I was thoroughly impressed with how nice and furnished the building was.  The room service was very kind and quick.  The reception desk was very respectful and kind when I arrived.  Even had a pool where I could take a quick dip after a long stressful days work.  Everything in this place was great, highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the Chicago area.
