Chicago Cupcake Tour I had scheduled a tour for me and my friend and received a phone call two days prior to our scheduled date that it was canceled.  I called back and the tour guide reschedules it for a week later.   Here it is a week later.  We drive 45 miles into the city to find out there was NO tour!!!  I called the tour guide twice and he never called me back.  WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THIS????  I'm livid, and I want my money back.   My friend and I had the list of all the places on the tour and we decided to do our own since we came all that way.  We walked it in the bitter rain, but the places were fabulous.  We ordered what we wanted, took our time, enjoyed the scenery and ended up paying less than when it would've cost to go with the tour.    Save yourselves the headache and just do your own relaxed and cheaper cupcake tour.  What a rip off!  THIS SHADY BUSINESS CANNOT POSSIBLY GO ON!!
