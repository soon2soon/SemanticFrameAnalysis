My husband and I recently visited Chicago and took Chicago's Finest River Walk Tour.  Not being from the area, we wanted to learn about the city's history and architecture.  Because it claimed to have an intimate small group atmosphere and being avid walkers, this one piqued our interest.   Dan, our guide, was very knowledgeable, and because of his unique sense of humor, it was truly a memorable and fun afternoon.  We plan to take another one of the tours, either the Night Lights or Brunch, when we visit again next summer, and would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Chicago.  You will walk away with a smile, and more knowledge of the city then you could ever imagine in two hours.
