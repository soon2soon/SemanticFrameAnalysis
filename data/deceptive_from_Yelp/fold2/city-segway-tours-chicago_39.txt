Girls trip to Chicago and my friend signed us up as a surprise Mother's Day gift for us.  I really was skeptical but our guide, Meadows was wonderful and very good with instructions on how to actually ride.  We only had four people in our group and we all said we would do it again at the first opportunity.  We saw sights we never would have seen if we were just walking and touring the lake front.  We highly recommend the activity and if you can get Meadows as your guide, we guarantee you will have a great experience.
