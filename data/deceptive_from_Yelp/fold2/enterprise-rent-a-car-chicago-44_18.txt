I am writing this review to let you know about the EXCELLENT customer service I received recently at the Enterprise Car Rental in Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois.   During the holidays we had rented a vehicle through another agency.  We arrived at the airport, all 5 of us with 6 bags in tow only to find that they did not have the correct vehicle.  The manager of this particular company was, to put it nicely, less than helpful.  First he tried to give us a smaller vehicle and then informed us we could come back the next day and he might have something available.  Lastly he told us we could search for another vehicle ourselves, and let him know if we found anything.  My husband and I split up, he started at one end and I started at the other. Luckily for me, the first counter I approached was the Enterprise counter. The young lady there, Mary Jones was a God-send!! She immediately sensed that I was upset and as I explained the situation to her,   she went to work looking for a way to assist us.  Within 15 minutes she had located an appropriate vehicle, had it booked and directed us to the rental garage.   When we arrived at the rental garage area, as the doors opened there was a young man there to assist us with our bags.  He was extremely courteous and thoughtful.  He loaded our bags in the vehicle, went over all the controls with my husband and directed us on our way.  As we were checking out of the garage, another young man at the gate once again asked if we needed any directions. Throughout the whole experience, the Enterprise personnel were helpful and courteous.  They should all be commended.  I did not get the names of the garage personnel. However, this was the night of December 26, 2013 at approximately 7pm.  I have never rented from Enterprise before, but both my husband and I agree that from now on we will be regular customers whenever we need to rent a vehicle.   I would just like to end this with a final thought.....JOB WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
