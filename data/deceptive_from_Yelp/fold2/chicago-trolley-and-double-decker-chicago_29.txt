I took this tour today and needed to write this while it was still fresh in my mind. I can't believe I haven't taken this tour sooner! I saw them all the time, but, was never inclined to take a tour. I'm so glad I finally did it, I had a great time from start to finish! Originally I was going to take my grandparents up to the Skydeck but they told us of the low visibility so we decided to kill some time and hope that it would improve as the day went on. As we glanced around I noticed a stand across the street with the Chicago Trolley logo. I thought it was the free trolley and got excited because I thought they brought them back. When we asked the girl if the free trolley was running she told us they stopped running last year. Although I was heartbroken, I asked what it was that she offered. She explained how the tour worked, where it went and the types of tickets they had. I noticed they hit a lot of places we wanted to see so we were sold. Just before we paid, my grandparents asked if there was a senior rate (they were nearing 75), she told them she did, but, that they had to be over 65. They were totally flattered and I think it even made their day! The guides and drivers we got were awesome! I can't remember her name but there was an older lady driving the bus who was so sweet! I got a kick out of the singing guide, too! Deepest voice I've ever heard! I almost forgot, you get a free sample of Garrett's which was sooo good! If you are looking for a tour or even a way to get around, this is the best and easiest way to do it. I can't wait to have more family visit, I'm sure they won't disappoint! Their customer service is some of the best I've received in a very long time!
