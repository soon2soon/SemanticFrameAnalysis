First time to Chicago, we were staying 3 nights and needed a hotel near tourist attractions. This certainly fit the bill. Wonderful service especially from the concierge, Amanda, who was very helpful as was the man who worked during the evenings. As we landed at O'Hare I received an email from the Fairmont to check in before arrival. Because of this the room was ready when we arrived although it was still very early. The room was comfortable and the elevators were many and quick to the 23rd floor. The Hotel was within walking distance of much of what we wanted to see and was only a $10 taxi fare to Second City. A great experience and a reasonable price for the location. I would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
