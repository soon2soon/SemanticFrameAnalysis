I had booked a Costa Rico vacation with them for a lot of money for my family.  My son ruptured his appendix a week before our trip.  We contacted them to let them know and they said that they were sorry but that their policy was that they would keep 100%  of the money that we had sent to them for our trip.  That may be their policy, but they made a ton of money off of my son's ruptured kidney by canceling all of our excursions, hotels, airport pickups and then pocketing it all.  I HATE THIS COMPANY!!!!   Next time we would book direct and not go through a group like this.
