We were planning a trip for members of a university dorm. Chicago Trolley picked us up right on-schedule at our house. Lance, our tour guide, was amazing. Not only did he give a great tour (even making unexpected fog fun), he also recommended a great burger joint for after the tour. Sims, our driver, was very professional and friendly. We could not have asked for a better experience.
