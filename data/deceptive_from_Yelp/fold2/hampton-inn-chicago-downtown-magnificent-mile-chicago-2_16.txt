Expensive.  Noisy AC. The modest size TV was 20' away from the bed.  No power jacks.   No glass in the bathroom. Mediocre layout (college dorm refrig sitting in hallway).  One small ceiling light -like living in cave. Our taxi driver told us that the bellhop extorts cash from taxis seeking access to hotel guests.
