It is a great place to stay! We have 3 small children and it was the perfection location. There is a park just blocks away, along with an indoor play place/ coffee shop for those rainy days. There are also plenty of restaurant choices! This is the perfect location with all the city options, but with all the comforts of home! We highly recommend {oh, wait, we want to come here again, and again... so maybe we'll keep it a secret ;-}!
