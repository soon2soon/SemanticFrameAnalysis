We've had great experiences renting our house with Gameday housing.  We've rented out current house with them 12 times and our previous house a handful of times as well.  We've only had to make two security deposit claims, and both were resolved within a few weeks and caused us no work or stress.  Wes responds to my emails usually same day and their customer service is excellent.  I recommend it to many of my friends (although not too many, because I don't want their houses chosen over mine!).
