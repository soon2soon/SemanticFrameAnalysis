I was in Chicago for a brief conference and stayed here for two nights. I found the room clean and well-maintained. The Keurig coffeemaker worked as advertised. The only downside that I experienced was that the restaurant was not open before 7am for breakfast. If you're a business traveler, that may be an issue depending upon when you have to leave. However, the day that I was able to take advantage of the restaurant on-site, the food was fine. No problems and I'd be willing to stay here again. (By the way, the free bottled water by the elevators was a terrific perk and one that I took advantage of!)
