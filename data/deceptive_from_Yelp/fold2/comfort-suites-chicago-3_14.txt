Stayed at Comfort Suites many times in the last year. Consistent customer service. Great transportation location quick walk to trains. Beautiful views of the river or the park.  Close to the lake for a great morning run. If raining, a LA Fitness a few blocks away.  Great restaurants within one block.  The staff knows your name. Free breakfast after your morning run along Lake Michigan.  The rooms have a refrigerator, stove, dish washer and washer dryer if you are staying awhile.  I have had nothing but great service. On site Management takes care of the guests.  You can certainly pay a lot more in the area but why?
