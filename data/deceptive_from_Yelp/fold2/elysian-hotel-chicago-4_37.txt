By reading these reviews, most have been written by hotel staff.  Take caution when standing out on your balcony, cigarette ash, buts, spit will often pass by.  (Don't believe me, look down and see the thousands of cigarette butts.)  Hotel delivery truck honking all night long, The roar and stench of the trucks draining the kitchen grease traps at 5:30am is music to one's ears.  The head chef has quit, and the joint is on the market.
