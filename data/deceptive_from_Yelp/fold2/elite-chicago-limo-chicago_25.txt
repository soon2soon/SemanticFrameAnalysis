I used Elite Limo services for my wedding, and I was more than impressed. The Lincoln Navigator Limo was beautiful, clean, and fully stocked. The light displays and video screens were very impressive and made our day extra fun. The driver arrived about 10 minutes early, which I really love to see. He was both friendly and polite, and had no problem finding the destinations. We even decided on a last minute photo stop, and he was able to follow our directions there with no problem. I felt very special receiving red carpet service (literally - the driver rolled out a red carpet for us to walk in and out on!) and the driver was also very polite assisting the women into and out of the vehicle (in our stilettos!). I would absolutely use Elite Limo again and I highly recommend them to everyone else. Their prices are very competitive in Chicago, so it really was a bargain with the exceptional service.
