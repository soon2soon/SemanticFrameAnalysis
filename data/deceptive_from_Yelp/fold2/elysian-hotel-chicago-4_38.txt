Three couples were downtown Chicago for a Holiday weekend.  Before dinner on Saturday night we decided we wanted to try the new Elysian Hotel for drinks.  What a disaster.  First of all the lounge is VERY small and loud.  And secondly it took over 45 minutes for us to get our drinks - and even then we had to find the manager to get them.  So our cocktail hour was ruined and we had to literally gulp our drinks to make our dinner reservation.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I will never enter that hotel again.  If they cannot even run a small cocktail lounge I would hate to think of them managing an entire hotel.
