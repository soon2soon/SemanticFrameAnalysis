Location, Location, Location!   Had a wonderful nights stay at the Conrad. My room overlooked Michigan Avenue which was a pleasant surprise.    The room was large and nicely decorated with a King Sized bed.   The bathroom was something to die for.  It had a large soaking tub, glass shower, marble counter top sink and a separate room with the toilet.   I didn't eat at the restaurant since I thought the menu was a bit to steep in price so I opted to get my dinner from the North Bridge Mall which is conveniently connected to the Conrad.   I will definitely be coming back to the Conrad again.
