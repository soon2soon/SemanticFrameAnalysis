Don't miss this amazing tour!  Chicago's First Lady provides the best of everything when it comes to seeing Chicago!  Beautiful, well kept vessels - in fact, I was lucky enough to board their newest, largest boat, Chicago's Leading Lady!  The staff was informative, professional and delightful and the tour is beyond memorable.  Chicago's Architecture Foundation partners with Chicago's First Lady to ensure that you learn everything about Chicago's history, the beautiful buildings, our city's prominent architects and many fun facts about Chicago.  The beautiful Chicago weather we were fortunate enough to have added to the experience and our docent, I believe his name was Barry was brilliant!  And funny ... by the end of the tour our entire group was saying, "Kiss Your Architect!"
