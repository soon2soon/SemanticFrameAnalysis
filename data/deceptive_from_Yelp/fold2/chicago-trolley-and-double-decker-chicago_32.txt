I am a born and raised South-Chicagoian, and when my relatives from San Francisco CA, came to visit last week I wanted to make their first trip to the Windy City as fun and eventful as possible!  We went to see Jersey Boys, had plenty of pizza, and went to the Hancock Observatory.  On their last full day here we were walking along Michigan Ave. near the Water Tower Place and say a nice looking, energetic young man selling Chicago Trolley Tour Tickets!  Because it was such a sunny day, and he assured us that the Trolleys were heated we decided to take the Hop-on, Hop-off tour!   It was fantastic!  We were able to see the entire city while having a wonderful guide/driver!  He was entertaining and joked around with everyone, especially my family because they were from San Francisco, where Trolleys were iconic! We were able to take the trolley to Millennium Park and Saw the Museum Campus then we got off by the theaters and got our FREE Garrett's Popcorn and made it back to the Hotel/Drake before they finished for the day! Even being from Chicago, it is not often that I take time and really try to enjoy it and learn about my city!  We all had a wonderful experience and fully enjoyed the tour.  Whenever I have friends or family come to the city I will recommend Chicago Trolley Tours to them!
