Just spent the weekend,Nov. 20-23, at the suites. Everything was GREAT except for the fact that even though it was the Festival Of Light Christmas weekend and every other hotel and store front was decorated for Christmas, there wasn't a hint of the holidays at the Embassy Suites! This is why we come for this weekend. Had to go sit in the lobby of the other hotels to get in the spirit! Come on Embassy Suites, how about a tree or a wreath or two. There were plenty of little children staying at your hotel for the parade it would be especially nice for them!
