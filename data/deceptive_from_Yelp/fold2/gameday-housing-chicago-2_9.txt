We have stayed in two Gameday houses over the last couple of years for Notre Dame football games.  The staff was very helpful in finding us a property that would best suit our group, while within our budget.   Gameday has a great selection of homes with unique character and great owners.  We will never stay in a hotel for a football game at ND again.  Renting a house has proven to be more comfortable and conducive to catching up with ok friends!
