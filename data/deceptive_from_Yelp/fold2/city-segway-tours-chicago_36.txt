This was our first segway tour and we thoroughly enjoyed it!! We were are so nervous before we started, but our tour guide was so calm and supportive. He was great at explaining the city's history. He kindly learned each of our names and was engaging the whole trip. Â We recommend City Segway Tours and our guide Meadows without hesitation! -"Dallas, South Carolina, and Florida"
