Don't use this service unless you are comfortable with not getting quoted properly and you want to pay twice the amount.  I spoke with T'Sheeka who quoted me a rate that seemed too good to be true.  I said "Wow" and She responded, "Well that is the price because this is a long way and round trip."  I said, "I think that sounds pretty cheap."  At the end of the convo she quoted back we will be charging $184.00 to your card.  Do you agree?  I never received a reservation confirmation, only a credit card auth form to fill in a signature.  Ultimately, had I known how much I was really going to pay, I would have called around a gotten a few more quotes.  I would never pay $400 for a round trip pick up and drop off service, NEVER. I have used other limo services in the past and have NEVER paid that much.   T'Sheeka, next time you need to learn that quote you give people needs to be for the ENTIRE amount, not one way! David, what you quote and what you charge are 2 different things!  You can't quote someone one price and then charge them double after the service has been provided and expect them not to get upset.  You have a lot to learn about running a business.  Also, you did not provide the beer.  We brought our own.  I don't have a problem paying for service.  I have a problem with getting scammed and not being provided with correct quotes.  And as a testament to not having an issue paying for service, we tipped an additional $40 to our drivers on top of the 20% we paid.  Also, if you google map directions from A to B it's 35 minutes.  Face the facts, your dispatcher didn't quote me right and now you are trying to cover yourself and the customer is the one paying for your mistake!
