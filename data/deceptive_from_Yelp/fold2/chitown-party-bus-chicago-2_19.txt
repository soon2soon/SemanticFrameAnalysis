We came upon ChiTown Party Bus while looking for transportation around downtown for pictures on our wedding day.  Being one of the cheaper party bus companies, we weren't sure what to expect, but the bus was very clean, the driver was very nice and accommodating to a couple last minute changes in route.  All in all we had a great experience with ChiTown Party Bus, and will look to them again if we need similar transportation in the future!
