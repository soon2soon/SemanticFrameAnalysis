We had a really great time riding around downtown in a stretch limo before heading to dinner for a special birthday celebration. The limo was clean and elegant, with fresh ice in the bar, already-chilled water, and champagne glasses all nicely in place. The driver was super professional and gave us a great experience. We wanted to plug an iPod into the audio and he pulled over and came back to hook it up for us. He picked us up right on time, and when we were ready to be picked up after dinner, we texted him and he was there quickly. I've rented limos elsewhere, and this experience was definitely above the others especially because of the courtesy and professionalism of the driver. I'd definitely recommend them!
