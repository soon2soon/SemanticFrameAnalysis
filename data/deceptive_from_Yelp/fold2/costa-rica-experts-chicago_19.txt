Excellent! Our trip to Costa Rica was perfect. All of our connections were smooth and trouble free, we were upgraded for free in at least one hotel. The in country agency that Costa Rica Experts uses to help it's clients with any changes or modifications to their itineraries handled a couple of our special requests promptly, enthusiastically and at no extra charge. Their recommendations for hotels, destinations and activities were well thought out and perfectly suited to us. Using a knowledgeable agent, one who specializes in the country you are visiting, is key in planning your trip, especially if it is your first visit.  The agents at Costa Rica Experts have been to Costa Rica repeatedly and know the country well.  They have all the contacts to book a smooth trip as well as the knowledge to recommend an itinerary that is suited to your tastes.  They also deal with the language barrier that you would face if you tried to book the trip yourself as well as the myriad of frustrating details that would take a first timer hours if not days to work out on their own.  Agencies are compensated primarily discounts offered by the hotels and tour operators, so any minor cost to us of using an agent is more than off set by the convenience, security and hassle free travel.  I highly recommend Costa Rica Experts.  We worked with Brandon, but I heard good things about their other agents too from at least one other family that we met during our stay.
