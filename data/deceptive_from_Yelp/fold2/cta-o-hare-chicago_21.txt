This is the way to travel around the city. I am new to public transportation Â and man im hooked. $14.00 for 3 days unlimited rides ANY trains in the city. Red , Blue Purple Brown or green there is no place in Chicago you cant get. We got from O'Hare to Willis Tower in 50 min in mid day traffic. I will be doing more of my travel with the CTA. Great job Chicago. Clean Stations.
