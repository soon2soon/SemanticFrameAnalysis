I am in Chicago again and decided to stay at the Four Seasons Chicago . Nice size rooms and great bedding. everything has a nice clean modern look. they have a great location right in the middle of all the shopping and i actually have a lake view this time. Seems like the internet is a bit outdated and very slow, that's a bit of a disappointment but I can just run across the street to Starbucks (up the block a bit) and get online. Its a great place to stay in the perfect location.
