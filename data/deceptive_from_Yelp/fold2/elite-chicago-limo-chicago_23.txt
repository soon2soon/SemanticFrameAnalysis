I normally don't do things like this but I just had to share. Let me start by thanking the company for being very flexible and accommodating. I had a few change of plans and they help accommodate every one of them. We celebrated my husband's birthday this past Saturday and wanted to arrive in style to our destination, after calling around to a few different companies we decided to book with Elite. The bus arrived to pick us up on time; in fact they were like 10 min early which was great..... VERY AFFORDABLE pricing, EXCELLENT service and VERY NICE and STYLISH Party Bus. I have already recommended them to several of my friends and plan to use them again in the near future. We really enjoyed the bus and service. Thank you ELITE!!!!!
