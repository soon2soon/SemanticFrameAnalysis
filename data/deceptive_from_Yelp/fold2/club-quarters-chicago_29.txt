My wife and I recently spent two nights in this hotel during a very busy summer week-end. Every aspect of our stay was perfect. The location within the city couldn't be better. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Our room was tastefully decorated, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. It was also very quiet, despite the hotel being quite busy. Upon checking in, my wife asked if a room at the front of the hotel was available. One was, and we were cheerfully placed there at no additional charge. The view was fantastic Bravo!
