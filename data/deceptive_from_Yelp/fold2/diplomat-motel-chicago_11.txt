An absolutely awesome little motel right in Downtown Chicago! Don't get lost in some high rise hotel! Its a simple and easy joint with free parking, wifi, and coffee! 3 Day stay at this motel was fantastic. Great staff and good accommodations is all you need on your trip! Don't waste your money anywhere else!
