This is my first time to go thru a visa service agent to get China Travel Visa.  Last time  I  took my family to tour China in 1994 and  all  I  had to do was  sending in our visa applications thru US Certified mail by ourselves.  Time has changed these days.  Now we need to go thru a agent to get China Visa done.  I  am very happy to choose China Visa Service Center for the job, nice service, quick and friendly job being well done through the whole process.   The service rep. are friendly and always on their best in serving the customers ( me ).  The service  fee  I spent  is reasonable and they are doing an excellent job !  I  would tell all my friends if they need the China visa  for their visits :  GO TO  China Visa Service Center  FOR HELP.
