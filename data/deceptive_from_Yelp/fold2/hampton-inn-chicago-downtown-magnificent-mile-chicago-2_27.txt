We liked this placeaMy wife and I really enjoyed our stay here. Great views of the city from our hotel room and had a very restful sleep. Check in process was quick, no wasting time so we were able to get out and enjoy the city before my meetings started the next day. The food was really good. We tried room service for a late night snack and it arrived nice and hot and quick! The next morning we did breakfast up in the lounge and it was really good, hot and not only tasted good but looked good. Food in the pub was enjoyable and the brews were refreshing.Overall we really enjoyed the Avenue Crowne Plaza and would stay here again in a heart beat.
