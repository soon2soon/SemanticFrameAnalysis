This is a fantastic alternative to a taxi if you happen to be traveling in the area.   Not only is it inexpensive, but it is always running on time.  One review mentioned an issue finding a ticket booth - well this is simple.  You can buy your ticket on the boat.  The customer service on board is top notch, and it really is a fun ride with excellent views. Note that in order to get to the boat, you will need to be able to go up and down stairs.  Some stops have more stairs than others, but there is no way around that.  I take the water taxi as often I can, at least a few times per month.
