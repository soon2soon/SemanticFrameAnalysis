Second fabulous experience aboard Chicago's First Lady Cruise lines - both times for private corporate events. Carol our Charter Sales Manager made planning these events a breeze! Docent from the Chicago Architectural Foundation was interesting and knowledgeable. Captain and crew on both the Chicago's First Lady and Chicago's Little Lady could have been more accommodating! We'll be back!
