This was a lovely place with a very homey feel.  It had a lovely backyard area with a deck and barbecue, large updated kitchen and renovated bath, two bedrooms with a couch that could be made into a bed in the living room, so it could fit a number of people.  The area is great, close to the L, steps from restaurants and shopping in a clean and lively area. The owner is friendly and helpful and I would definately like to stay again and will recommend to friends and family should they need to stay in Chicago. One could see by the questbook that eveyone felt the same.
