Took the Signature Architecture Tour with George! He is a fountain of interesting information related to the history of the buildings, design features and facts about the architects that shaped Chicago as a city. His enthusiasm is bubby and he thoroughly enjoys telling Chicago's story. Well worth the money...excellent value!
