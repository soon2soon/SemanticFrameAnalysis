This is not your typical Fairfileld.  It's located only a right in between Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue so you can basically walk anywhere you want to go in the city!  They recently redid the lobby and the rooms so it's like a brand new hotel (thumbs us to the management).  The staff is courteous and very helpful with any request.  I've recommended the hotel to friends and family, all of which were very pleased.  I highly recommend it.
