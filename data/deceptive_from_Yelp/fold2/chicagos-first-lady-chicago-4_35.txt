I had two visitors to town so bought 3 tickets for the First Lady online through ticketmaster. The line was already building when we first arrived (well before boarding), but there were seat numbers on our tickets so we weren't concerned. However, when we finally climbed onto the boat, we found that it was free seating. OK, after seeing the seats were plastic chairs, part of me expected this. Not a problem, we thought, we'll just grab three seats and pull them together. However, as we wandered around the boat, we found that there wasn't even two seats left together, let alone three. Other small groups were clearly in the same predicament. As such, we spent most of the 1.5 hour cruise standing on the side up by the bow - able to see only the right side of the river. For a company that charges $45/ticket for a 90 minute cruise, it shouldn't be unreasonable to expect that they don't oversell the boat so much that a group as small as three can't acquire a seat. If they have 200 seats, for example, they should view their capacity at 175 people, so as to help eliminate these issues - part of the cost of running a premium product. At the very least, have ushers which can help manage the seat usage. The reason this gets 1 star (and not 2) is because I reached out to CFL to explain my issue, and no one contacted me back (it has been over two weeks). My advice - if you are going with a group of greater than 2 people, look at some of the less popular cruises so you can actually sit together and see the whole river.
