We used Elite Chicago Limo service for two different trips around Chicago.  They were fantastic!  I appreciate being able to call a real person and ask questions and make changes to our reservations.  The drivers were all excellent. They were on time and got us to each destination at the time they promised.  The limo was clean and comfortable.  If we ever go back to Chicago we will be using Elite Chicago Limo service again.
