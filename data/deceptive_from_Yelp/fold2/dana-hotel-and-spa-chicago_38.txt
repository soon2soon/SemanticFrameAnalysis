My wife  and I booked a  get-a-way weekend in  Chicago and had the privilege of staying at the Dana Hotel and Spa.  Like many of you, I read all the reviews. We proceeded forward, confident of our decision but with a heads up to a few potential issues. A Marriott or Ritz Carlton seemed a safe choice, but  we wanted a different  experience...and I must say we had that in every way.     The Dana experience surpassed every expectation.  The front end welcome from the curbside (T.J. you're amazing), to the bell-hops, the front desk (more like a sit down conversation) to the concierge (you Rock Romeo, thanks for the recommendation and reservation to a great Italian restaurant on short notice).  The rooms, the view, the shower, the urban  vibe - I would do  it all over again...and plan to.  Oh yes, the breakfast each morning was equally amazing.  Thank you Dana staff for exceeding our expectations in every way. Highly Recommend...but don't tell everyone you know there won't be room for all of us.
