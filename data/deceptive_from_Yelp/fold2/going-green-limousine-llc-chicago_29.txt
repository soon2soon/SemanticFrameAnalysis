1. A real person answered the phone on the second ring to make a reservation--at 10:30 on a Saturday night. 2. The only car or taxi service in Chicago that has infant car seats and booster seats (after calling about 10 of them). 3. Email confirmations sent immediately after calling. 4. On time. 5. Very clean, high-quality SUV. Even without their use of hybrids and alt fuels, this service would still be the best car service I've used.
