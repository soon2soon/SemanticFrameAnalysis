Took the chocolate tour today with Seth. My wife and I love chocolate and were celebrating our anniversary. Seth was knowledgable about Chicago's history, the neighborhoods and the chocolate. It was a nice tour of River North highlighting a number great dessert places. We were in a sugar coma at the end. Thank you Great Food Tours and Seth.
