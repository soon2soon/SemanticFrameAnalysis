I had an excellent experience on the Unsung Chicago Classics tour last weekend. Â A neat way to see different parts of the city, and a great time, especially for foodies who want to sample a variety of interesting and tasty items, discuss their favorite food/dining establishments with those with a similar passion for food, and even work in a little exercise, too. Not only do Sharon and Dimitra do a very good job of picking out the right places, but they also provide helpful explanations of the history and/or significance of the places visited.
