Get a stand by ticket from US Airways and fly to Phoenix.  You will be leaving in the airport for a month and you will not be able to go to Phoenix.  The best part of this standby ticket, you stay in OHare Airport for $150 for a month and you have a/c, tv, and internet.  What a deal.  US Airways will not fly you out of the airport.  There's a lot of standing by and you are the lowest of the lowest priority.  It's like living in luxury for little cost.
