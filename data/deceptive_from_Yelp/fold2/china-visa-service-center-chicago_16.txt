I'm traveling abroad for the first time this fall (to China), so I had never gotten a Visa before and I was a little concerned about sending my passport and money off to some company that I only know from a Google search.  And as previous reviewer Austin B said, there are a lot of unsavory dealings in China.   Anyway, this was the only company that I could find any reviews on, plus they're BBB rating checks out, so I went with them and was not disappointed.  Fair price, decent speed (under 2 weeks door to door), and way easier than a trip to the Consulate.  They also keep you updated via email on when they receive your information and when they are sending it back to you.   Will definitely use then again if I need to.
