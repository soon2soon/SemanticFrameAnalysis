I used Global Adrenaline for my trip to Tanzania and they were over the top fantastic! I had to arrive late for the trip due to business so the whole front end was all specially arranged from airfare, to hotel to special trasnport including a puddle jumper into the Masai and everything went off without missing a beat. I joined the rest of the group and was amazed at the luxurious accommodations, extremely knowledgeable field experts and the total support of GA's staff! I have traveled all over the world with A&K, Butterflied, Seaborne and many tour operators and Global Adrenaline is the BEST!
