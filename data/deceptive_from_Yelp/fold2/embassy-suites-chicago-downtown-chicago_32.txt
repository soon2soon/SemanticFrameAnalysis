It's a beautiful facility. The location is nice. The staff is excellent. The rooms are also very nice. They offer free, complementary breakfasts which are delicious. That being said, there are too many kids. You have to pay $10 for wi-fi :( The pool is too small. The biggest problem lies though with the elevators. They stop on every single floor.
