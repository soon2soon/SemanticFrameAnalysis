Very convenient location, super friendly and helpful staff, free internet at the reception. They let you keep your luggage there after check-out so that you can pick it up later. The sauna could be more warm. The pool is shallow, but it is still possible to swim there. Tip: There is a jazz bar just across the street (Andy's Jazz Club & Restaurant)!
