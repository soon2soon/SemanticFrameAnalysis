Terrible service.  Less than pleasant way to end a vacation. When planning this year's holiday vacation, my husband and I thought we would treat ourselves to a comfortable return...no waiting after a four-hour flight,  etc.  After our experience with 'Going Green Limousine', we wished we had opted for public transportation or a stinky cab. I'll keep it brief...in making my reservation, I specified the number of passengers (2 adults and a 2.5 year-old toddler), that we would need a forward-facing car seat for our son, that we would have a travel stroller and three pieces of luggage.  All of this was communicated AND actual...3 passengers and 4 pieces confirmed in the reservation.  Upon being picked up by Jeff in a Ford Escape, he immediately challenged my husband, who was assisting him with the luggage; Jeff charged my husband with not giving an accurate description of our luggage to the reservationist, commenting that they "have others" in terms of sizes of cars.  Rude and unprofessional rather than apologetic for the tight fit.  Happy New Year to you too Jeff.  Even luggage aside, two average-sized adults and a carseat in the backseat of small SUV is tight.  Not impressed and even more disappointed in the response I received from the company's president after I replied to an auto-email I received from the company in which they stated they were confident we would be happy with the service.  Wow...presumptuous.   She claimed that they had never had any complaints and that she was surprised to hear my commentary about Jeff.  Really? I'll leave it at that.  Just hope to save someone else the disappointment. Oh...and one star is justified because scheduling was relatively simple (although they didn't note that I needed a toddler forward-facing car seat so they needed to clarify that while I was in baggage claim).
