I'm a resident of Chicago and my girlfriend was visiting, so we decided to check out the sights if beautiful Chicago. We were unsure at first to get on a Segway but our guide Luke had the utmost confidence in us and in turn made us confident. It was a great tour and Luke even saved my girlfriend from running into traffic once. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting and I hope they get Luke as their tour guide.
