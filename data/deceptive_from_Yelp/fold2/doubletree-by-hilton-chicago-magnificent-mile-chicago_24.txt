The convenient location is what drew us to this hotel, and quite frankly, that was the best feature. I guess it was the price to amenities ratio that really dampened my enthusiasm. There was nothing terribly impressive about this place, neither good nor bad. A small refrigerator would certainly have helped, instead of the wildly overpriced "honor" snack-tray and minibar. Also in-room wi-fi, especially for Hilton Honors members, would sure have been nice. The staff that greeted us were friendly, though. I wouldn't rule out a return visit, but not before I check out other hotels in this area.
