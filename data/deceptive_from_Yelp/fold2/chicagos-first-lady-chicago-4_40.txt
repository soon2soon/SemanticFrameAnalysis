This was a Chicago highlight for us.  The 90 minute river cruise was narrated by an excellent docent who was able to talk about the buildings and their history for the full trip without ever being boring!  Throughout the rest of our visit  in Chicago we would see the local buildings through her eyes and use the information she had given us to learn/enjoy the rest of our time in Chicago.  We went on the cruise  on a chilly November  day, but with a bit of sun, an engaging guide and such fabulous architecture we spent most of our time outside taking photos and enjoying the view.  Some  hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps also helped.
