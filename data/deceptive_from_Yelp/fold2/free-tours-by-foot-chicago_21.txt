I just recently did the Riverwalk tour with Claire. It started pouring rain in the middle of the walk and she graciously maneuvered her way around so that we ended up Â completing all the sights in the tour. She really new her stuff, told us some great stories, and even stayed back with me to make some personal recommendations, which I checked out on my own and loved. She even sent a great follow-up email with a bunch more recommendations that were perfect for my trip. Claire has great energy and charisma, the makings of a great guide - I would highly recommend her tour to anyone visiting Chicago!
