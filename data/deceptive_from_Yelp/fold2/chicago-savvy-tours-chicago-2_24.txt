George Pudlo and his team have done walking architectural tours as well as an Art Institute scavenger hunt for our global teams traveling to Chicago. Each time, I have had compliments from team members from around the world on the beauty and history of Chicago and on the wonderful learning and fun experience delivered by Chicago Saavy Tours. Anytime I have a group in town, I call George. -Dana Quality and Leadership Training Global Market Research Firm
