One of Marriott's worst properties downtown. Way over priced because of some event in town.  Some how or another status means nothing to them as my king reservation was changes to two twin beds. As a man who is 6'5", even sleeping diagonal, something is going to hang of the bed.  I'd sleep on the floor but not sure how clean that is. I have stayed in youth hostiles in 3rd world countries that smelled better than the lemon & vomit scented air freshener that assaulted me when I walked in my room.   The internet was so weak and saturated that I had better luck picking up the free wifi from Subway next door. The hardwired connection had its own set of issues. I could go on and on but have only been checked in 30 minutes. Going to stop trying to ward the rest of the world and book myself another room somewhere.
