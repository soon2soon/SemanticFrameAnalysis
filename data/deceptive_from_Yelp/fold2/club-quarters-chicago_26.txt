My wife and I spent the night to celebrate our anniversary. I was excited to stay here, as I have talked about the building for years, on my tours. As I was checking in with Tim, I mentioned about our anniversary, and he immediately took back the key cards he had just given. He stated that since this was a special occasion, he wanted to make sure we really enjoyed ourselves. As such, we were upgraded to the Penthouse up on the 39th floor! Nice touch, Tim. Much appreciated! The room was very nice, and the view? FANTASTIC!!!! This is really what it's all about. Two issues come to mind: Only one pillow per person (really???), and a lack of towels in the bathroom. These are not make or break issues for me though. Service was outstanding, the price was great, and I WILL be back for another stay!
