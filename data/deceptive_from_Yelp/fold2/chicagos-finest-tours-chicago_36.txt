We have been on quite a few other tours of Chicago but this one was by far the best! I've found that if you are on a tour with one of the boats or buses that you'll hear the tour guide recite facts and figures about the different places you see but taking this tour with Dan you get an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide. I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone.
