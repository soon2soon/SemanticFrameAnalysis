What a trip. Absolutely NO ONE should listen to the critics on here because this was fantastic. I was in town for a family reunion - I run a B&B in CA - and we decided it was best, as a group with no grasp on this city we decided to orient ourselves before doing anything else. Turns out we never got around to the "anything else" because we had so much fun on the tour. We boarded at the Sheraton Hotel, where we were staying for our reunion (what great fortune!) and completed the 2 1/2 hour loop. It's advertised as 2 hours but, hey, can't be bad to get more for your money. We had the greatest tour guide, who shared my passion for travel, and I can't remember his name unfortunately. We were a large group so we ended up splitting up (definitely a good idea for a Saturday...was clearly a popular tour) and our group went to the Art Institute, Navy Pier and Sears Tower. The sales people can sell discounted tickets to these attractions so don't miss out, especially if you have a group as large as ours. We also took the free South Neighborhood tour with another outstanding guide - Mike was his name - and saw some neat remnants of the World's Fair, of particular interest to me :) There were two other Neighborhood tours that we didn't get around too. Best part? the company offers a night tour which is super relaxing after dinner and the buses were less crowded. And the weather cooled down. Man it's a hot summer in the Midwest!
