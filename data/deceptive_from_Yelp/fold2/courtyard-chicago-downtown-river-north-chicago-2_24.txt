Great location and great service from all of the staff.  I couldn't have been happier with our stay.  We were traveling with our two young children and a set of friends and managed to accommodate all of our needs.  We were right next door to our friends and they already had our room set up with a pack n play with the bedding already in place.  We were able to walk right in and put our sleepy baby down without any extra work, while the door staff delivered our luggage and helped us get settled in.   The rooms were very clean the bed was comfortable and the decor was very updated and had beautiful photographic artwork of Chicago landmarks. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 star rating is the fact that there was no booth in the lobby to sit and have breakfast on our own with our kids that wasn't in the restaurant.  The staff obviously doesn't want you eating there if you didn't purchase their food but it was the most convenient place to be able to sit and eat as a family.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay in downtown Chicago, especially if you drive because there is a self park lot a block down the street that was a fraction of the price of the hotel.
