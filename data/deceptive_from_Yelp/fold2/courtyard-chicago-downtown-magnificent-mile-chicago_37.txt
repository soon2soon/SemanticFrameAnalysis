I had been looking forward to staying in this famous old hotel and left rather disappointed. Faded glory rather sums it up. The bed was the best part of the room -reached down a tiny corridor to the fire escape of which I had an excellent view. When I arrived on a Saturday night there was a Halloween Ball taking place so nowhere to relax or even get a quiet drink. The downstairs pub was crammed with World Series watchers.
