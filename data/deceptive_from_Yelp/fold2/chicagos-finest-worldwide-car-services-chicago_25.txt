We were very happy with the service, the price, and the driver. Originally booked them with a groupon, and had no problem whatsoever using it. The driver was waiting for us when we got to our lobby, and the route he took to O'Hare was the "shortcut" route I take myself. That convinced me he knew what he was doing. Have used them since, and are quite happy with the service. I seriously doubt Nicole C.'s version of events, especially about extra fees. It's pretty clear on their information that early pick-ups (like before Â 5 a.m.) have an upcharge. Her expectation to get a premium service at regular rate seems unreasonable. I'd recommend them without hesitation.
