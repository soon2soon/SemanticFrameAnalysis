I booked the service with Exen Limousine from Loop Chicago to O'Hare Airport. The service was great, driver was ontime & polite. What the most important is the price as I used the service for airport with other limo compnanies and Exen Limousine has the best deal & I purchased their promotion on Yelp. Will definetely use their service in the future as I travel a lot:)
