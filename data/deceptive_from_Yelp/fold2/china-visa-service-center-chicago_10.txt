I was invited to go to China, but didn't have time to make the 4-hour trip to go to the consulate.  At first, I was REALLY nervous about sending all my documents and my passport off to some company.  I mean, they looked okay on line, but...you know...and I really trust them. I called them and spoke with Janet in the TX office.  Got assurances that all would be okay and answers to my questions.   Then, after I sent off all my stuff to them, I realized that I needed my passport back for another trip quicker than I expected. That's when the 5th star came in.  Janet put me in touch with Salina in the Chicago office.  No problem.  The moment they got my package they called for a credit card number to make it a rush job.  Got everything back, including the VISA, in 36 hours (including a weekend). These folks are for real.  Helpful, responsible, for me worth every penny.
