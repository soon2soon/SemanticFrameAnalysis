My husband and I took this cruise July 2014 when we vacationed in Chicago for a week.  We are in our early 30's.  We highly disliked the cruise.  It was recommended by a lot of people but it was not a great experience.  From what I have heard perhaps we got a very poor tour guide.  Our tour guide was a female who referred to herself as an  "archit-geek."  Her tour consisted of literally telling us the names of the architect's and who they collaborated with, firms they worked with/for, etc.  We found it very boring and an hour an a half was too much.  I was personally hoping to hear from facts on my cruise....how tall the buildings were, how much steel and glass were used, how much money it costs per month to live there, etc. - interesting things like that.  And other people told me they received that kind of info on their cruise.  Ours was a very poor experience.  We also went midday, 2pm, and so it was pretty hot. I don't recall the times of the cruises but I would recommend something in a cooler time of the day if you are going in the summer-time.   On a positive note, the views from the cruise are great and you can get some very cool pictures.
