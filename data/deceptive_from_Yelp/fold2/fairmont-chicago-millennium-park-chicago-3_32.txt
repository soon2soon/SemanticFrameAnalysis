Nice hotel, great staff, and friendly environment. Just make sure not to go during the model un conference that they have there. The kids crowd the hallways and staircases. They kept loitering outside my door and were extremely annoying. Also make sure that you dont get on an elevator with them, My wife and I got on one and were extremely uncomfortable because they jammed 25 kids in.
