I visit Chicago  frequently for business trips and I always stay at the Days Inn Chicago.  It is conveniently located 2 miles north of Downtown for easy access to all of Chicago's popular areas.. The staff is always smiling and has really taken the time to get to know me.  They just always go that extra mile, making each of my visits satisfying. Because I visit so often it was important that I find a nice but not over the budget hotel. I found that with the Days Inn Chicago.  It's a very well kept boutique hotel (not your average Days Inn) that would break your wallet.
