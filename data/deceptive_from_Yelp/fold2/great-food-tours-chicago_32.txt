The wife and I did the food tour today with a Groupon. Jason was outstanding, very knowledgeable of the area very friendly and receptive. Food was great. Staff at the stops didn't act like it was a burden. You get lots of samples, go hungry. Well run, laid back walk tour. Great job! Highly recommend!
