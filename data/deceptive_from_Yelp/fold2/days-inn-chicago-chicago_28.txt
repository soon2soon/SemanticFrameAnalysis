Stayed in the days inn for 5 nights and would find it hard to fault with the hotel, upon check in we were upgraded to a suite which was modern, clean and spacious. The bed is super comfortable and rooms well heated. The breakfast was lovely something for everyone. Only problem was the outside noise maybe it's time for the hotel to invest in some triple glazing windows but the free earplugs drowned out the majority of the noise
