I'm from Chicago, but with family in town, went on the River Walk and Loop Tour led by Sharon. It was quite enjoyable. The pace was suitable for all ages, they used headsets to make sure we could hear over the city sounds, and our guide was knowledgeable and friendly.  We even did a stop where we received a free small yogurt that was yummy.  I recommend this tour especially to people from other countries as it's not focused on "tourist attractions" and gives them a flavor of the working part of downtown.
