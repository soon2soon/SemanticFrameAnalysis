FLASH LIMOUSINESThis Limo service is a joke.  They told us at the last moment "the limo doesn't have A/C" quite honestly, my friends are troopers.... this isn't a deal breaker for our special night. So we get IN the limo to find that NOTHING works....no music to jam to, NOTHING electrical works and this puts a damper on the party experience we played for... as we sit chatting in silence, hardly the way to roll up to a concert experience. No one was apologetic, driver doesn't know where he's going so he defers to the party to give him directions back....worse yet, he cant follow simple directions and proceeds to miss not 1 but 4 to 5 consecutive turns.  A simple twenty minute ride turns into a 55 minute ordeal. Hey, in a quarter of a mile, you'll see 159th street, turn left" Nope still missed (4x) What a horrible joke of a service, we called the credit card company.  I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE TO ANYONE
