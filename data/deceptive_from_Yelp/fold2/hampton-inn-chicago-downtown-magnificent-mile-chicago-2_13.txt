BE CAREFUL  - I made a reservation here for a conference and then cancelled two days later.  Not in their system, they charged me for it, and now I see from other comments that reservation mistakes are common.  They also do not send any email communication regarding an upcoming stay.  Can't choose no stars - or I would have.
