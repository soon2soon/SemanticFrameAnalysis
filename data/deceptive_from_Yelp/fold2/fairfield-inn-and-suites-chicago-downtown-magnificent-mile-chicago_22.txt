Would I recommend this place? no way! the facilities were neat but basic. Super 8 Motels are as lovely. I stayed a for two nights (Sat/Sun) & was charged a total of $563 including parking...which was $49 per night. I detest to pay over $20 for parking at the best of times but Â $100 for the weekend? Well I guess this is Chicago...
