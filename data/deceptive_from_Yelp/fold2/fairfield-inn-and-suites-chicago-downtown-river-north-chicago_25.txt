We had a wonderful 3-night stay here. Everyone on the staff was warm and gracious--especially Javier in the breakfast room! At one point, my cell phone ran out of battery, right when I was trying to order pizza. I called down to the desk to ask for the number for Giordano's, and the extraordinarily helpful lady told me it would cost too much for me to place the call from my room phone, so she took the time to connect me! It's not easy to find a room in Chicago that will accommodate my family (4 kids), but the room with 2 queen bed + pull-out couch was perfect. Even the sofa bed was very comfy!
