Traveled to Charleston on business this past weekend, decided on the Market Pavilion based on an ad I saw at the airport. The hotel was well appointed and the staff was at my beckon call throughout my stay. Susanne, the concierge, was especially helpful in providing great restaurant recommendations and transportation for my business meetings. Be sure to try the in room dining as well, it is well worth the price tag.
