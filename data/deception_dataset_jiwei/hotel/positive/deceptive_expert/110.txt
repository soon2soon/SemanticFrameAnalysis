This is the second time I have stayed at The Setai. I am not sure it was possible but I think my second stay was better than my first!  I was welcomed back to the Hotel upon arrival and they even remembered my favorite treat from last time I visited and had it waiting in the room! I have many dietary restrictions and the hotel and chef have been very accomodating.
