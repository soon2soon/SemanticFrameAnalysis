I frequently travel to the Raleigh area on business and decided to stay at The Umstead for my most recent trip.  I am so glad I did!  The guestrooms are so spacious and the views are stunning, overlooking the scenic lake and grounds.  My room had a balcony and I truly appreciated having my coffee (brewed in my room with a Keurig!) while sitting outside and taking in the views.  It looks like they host weddings here with the expansive lawn, and what a beautiful place to get married.  The staff truly goes above and beyond to do special little touches, like bottled water by the bedside at turndown with chocolates and a bottle of water on your way out the front door.  I also really appreciated the complimentary wireless Internet, because I always hate being charged for that! While it is a bit pricier than other hotels, I certainly won't mind paying a little more for the perks of The Umstead.
