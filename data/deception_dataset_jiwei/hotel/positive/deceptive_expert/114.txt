My new favorite hotel. I stayed at the St. Regis before because it was new but was not impressed. After not being able to use my points there, I decided on The Setai and will never look back. 

I'm still loyal to St. Regis in any other city, but in Miami my choice is The Setai. Fantastic overall - from service, food to ambiance and style.
