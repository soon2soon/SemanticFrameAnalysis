I frequently do business in the Raleigh area and always stay at The Umstead.  I find that their amenities show great value even if you are paying a higher rate.  You are treated like royalty and the setting is so luxurious that the extra money you spent is made up in the quality rest you get while there.  I always return home feeling better than when I left because of the royal treament at The Umstead!
