We came to tour the university and staying at The Statler Hotel was the best option. The students that were working were able to answer all of our question. The hotel is conveniently place in central campus, a perfect location to tour the campus. It is great to see that the students have such a great opportunity working and learning at the same time. The Hotel School has a lot to be proud of. We hope our daughted gets accepted to Cornell. We will certainly spend the next four years staying at the Statler if she does!
