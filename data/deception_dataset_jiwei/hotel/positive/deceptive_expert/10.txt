The enthusiastic staff more than made our stay! The rooms were plush with Cornell blankets, mugs, and other nice touches throughout. If you want a true Cornell experience, this is the best place to stay, and if you ask nicely, they may even upgrade you to a room with a view of the clock tower if it's not too busy when you're staying.
