The staff is very accommodating in every area of the hotel! The front desk staff was welcoming and informative during arrival, departure and while we inquired about area attractions. The staff and food in Taverna Banfi were fantastic; the staff was knowledgeable about the food and wine and provided prompt service and delicious food. Our room was spacious and clean; we loved that it was serviced while we were out of the room. Lastly, the valet staff are friendly, organized, and fast! The Statler Hotel provides the total package, I'd give all of the students and full time staff an A+. Don't change a thing!
