My girlfriends and I were planning our annual girls getaway weekend, and with our lives being so busy, we really couldn't swing a 2-3 night stay like we normally do to places like Charleston or Wrightsville Beach.  A few of us had been to The Umstead for drinks or dinner and thought it would be a convenient way to all get together on a smaller scale.  I am so glad we did it!  The Umstead was so easy to plan with and they were able to put us in connecting rooms so we had plenty of space but also close proximity so we could get more time together.  We didn't get a chance to eat dinner on property because we went out downtown for dinner and drinks, but we did enjoy the spa facilities and a delicious brunch the morning we departed.  All encounters with staff were gracious and accommodating and we truly felt like we got a week's worth of quality time while at The Umstead!  The only negative thing I could say is that I wish it was located near more restaurants/nightlife.  That would have made this a 5 star review!
