My family and I typically travel to South Carolina to visit the beaches but this year we decided to add some history to our vacation this year and happened upon the Market Pavilion Hotel in Charleston, SC. Wanting to get as much information on the city as possible, we immediately headed to the concierge desk to find out more. Susanne was wonderful in getting us headed to all of the great sites nearby. She even arranged for a tour of Magnolia Plantation which was magnificent, be sure to include this on your itinerary. If you have accommodations elsewhere, at least stop by the Pavilion Bar on the rooftop for a drink, it has a great view of Charleston.
