We recently stayed at The Statler while visiting Cornell on a college tour with our son. He is applying to the hotel program at Cornell so it was impressive to see the program's students in action at the hotel, as they were all genuinely interested in helping us in any way possible and even took the time to discuss classes and answer some other questions my son had about the program. By and far the best campus hotel we stayed at on our trip and hopefully we will have the chance to stay there again in the future if he gets into Cornell!
