Decided to have my bachelorette party at the Pavilion Bar at the Market Pavilion Hotel. I was looking for some place that would be fun but not tacky or crazy. The Pavilion Bar was the perfect compromise. Situated in the heart of downtown, you can see beautiful views of the Charleston skyline. The servers went out of there way to accommodate our party and make my night special.
