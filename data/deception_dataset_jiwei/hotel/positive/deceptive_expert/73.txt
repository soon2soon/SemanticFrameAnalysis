I just spent an amazing weekend at the Umstead.  I justed stayed here with my wife for a birthday weekend and we had such a great time.  Everyone kepy wishing her happy birthday and they even sent some chocolates and champagne to the room.  You will be pampered from the moment you arrive to the time you depart.  Truly fantastic!
