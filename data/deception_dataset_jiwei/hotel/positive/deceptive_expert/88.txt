Wonderful stay! I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.  It just feels great to be at the hotel.  When you arrive there is a sense of calm and you are surrounded with beauty.  The artwork, design, flowers etc. all come together.  The staff is always gracious and will bend over backward to make guests happy.  I have always felt well  taken care of when I stayed here.
