Best location for tourists to stay.  Top notch rooms with quality decorations and extremely clean.  The rooftop bar is the hot spot in night life with the best view of Charleston overlooking the water and downtown.   We received a $50 food and beverage voucher for each night of our stay which we utilized in their steakhouse Grill 225.  The server was attentive, knowledgable but not hovering over us.  I have never had a finer steak.  It was so good that we ate there all three nights of our stay.  The staff at this hotel couldn't be friendlier or more helpful if they tried.  The General Manager was present and welcomed us to the hotel.
