The students truly made our stay. From our arrival when we were greeted by Alex who warmly welcomed us, to Savannah at the front desk who gave us a campus map and made dinner reservations for us at their hotel restaurant, everything was outstanding. When I am coming to Ithaca, there is only one place I will stay, and that's The Statler.
