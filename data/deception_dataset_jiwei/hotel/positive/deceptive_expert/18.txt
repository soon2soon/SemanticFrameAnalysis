Thank you for a fantastic stay. We came to Ithaca for a mini vacation and the staff was very helpful in recommending places for us to visit. They were not only knowledgeable about the campus but the town and area attractions as well. The wineries, gorges, shopping and restaurants were fantastic to see. After a long couple days of traveling and site-seeing it was nice to return to a clean, well appointed room. We will certainly stay at the Statler if we return to Ithaca (I hope that we do!)
