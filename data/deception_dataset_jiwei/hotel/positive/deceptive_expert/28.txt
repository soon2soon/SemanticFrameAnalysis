From the moment we got out of our cab, the bellman made us feel so welcome. He remembered our names from our last stay, which I thought was amazing! We love the pool, it is so serine, and the Shiatsu Massage my husband got he said was fantastic. The ricotta pancakes at Locanda Verde we had to have twice during our stay, and The Drawing Room and Outdoor Courtyard are the prefect public spaces to relax. Hard to beat The Greenwich Hotel. We love it there.
