It was our first time visiting New York and we were worried that we might get lost, but the Setai Fifth Avenue location was perfect for the first timer like us as we can walk anywhere to Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Empire State (the view we had from our room!), Madison Square Garden and other main attractions in NYC.  We saved a lot of money as we did not need to take a the yellow cab.  Perfect hotel in every way!
