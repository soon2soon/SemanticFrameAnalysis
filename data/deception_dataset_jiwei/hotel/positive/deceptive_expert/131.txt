The Setai Fifth Avenue is truly the number one hotel in New York City.  The size of the rooms are uncommon for New York, we booked the Standard room, but we thought we got upgraded because the size of the room is bigger  in comparison to the suite we booked in another hotel last time we visited.  

The service is the most important to me and the Setai staff has exceeded my expectations. They are alway willing to assist us with a smile.  This is the hotel that values their guests and made us very special in every way.   

The food at Ai Fiori  Restaurant which is a Michelin Star rated the best Mediteranean food I ever had and it is open for breakfast and lunch that made it easy for us to decide where to eat.   I will definitely return to Setai and I will recommend to my colleagues and friend.  It is the best hotel in New York City!
