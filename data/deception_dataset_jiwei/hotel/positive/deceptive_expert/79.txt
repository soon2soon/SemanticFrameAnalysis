If you are looking for a nice getaway to Charleston, and are willing to pay a little extra, the Market Pavilion Hotel is an excellent option. It is in a great location, right next to the market, and walking distance to almost anything that you would want to see. The in house restaurant is expensive, but the portions are huge and every bite is delicious. We loved the prime rib and ended our meal with their signature banana bread pudding. Don't let the price tag scare you, everything was worth it and you will not be disappointed.
