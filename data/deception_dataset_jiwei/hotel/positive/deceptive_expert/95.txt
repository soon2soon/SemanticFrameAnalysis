Can't wait to tell my friends about this treasure in Charleston.  While making reservations the reservationist was extremely patient with me in figuring out the best time to visit and explaining the different levels at the hotel.  We chose the concierge level.  The parlor was a great place in the evening to make new friends and swap stories.  The concierge went above and beyond in helping us book massages, mani/pedis, transportation and dinner.  No request was too small or too large for her to handle.  We already booked our return trip for my husband's birthday.
