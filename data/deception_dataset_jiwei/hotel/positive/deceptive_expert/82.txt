Originally booked online to stay two nights before traveling on to Savannah. But we had such a great time that we decided to stay in Charleston another night! Do not miss this hotel; if you are looking for an over the top grand hotel this is the place to go. Wonderful amenities, gorgeous room offerings, and fabulous customer service. Ask for Kelly in reservations to ensure you receive a top notch room with a view.
