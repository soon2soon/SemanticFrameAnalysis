We stayed in a two bedroom Corner Suite with our two teenage boys and it was the perfect setup. We had our own private adjoinging entranceway, a private dining area, and the perfect amount of space for a nice family retreat. The concierge was very helpful with acquiring great tickets to a terrific play, and suggested an amazing Austrian restaurant in the neighborhood that we never would have found on our own. Unlike any other hotel we've found. Very special.
