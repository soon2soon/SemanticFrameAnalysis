Loved, Loved, Loved our stay at the Market Pavilion Hotel!!!!  From the moment we stepped out of our car we were greated by a bellman in a tophat that set the mood for our stay in Charleston.  At checkin the front desk welcomed us with their southern hospitality.  The concierge was excellent with her recommendations for tours and dining.  Friendliest staff that anticipated our needs before we did.  Our room was luxurious with a great view of the market.  Can't wait to return to this fabulous hotel.
