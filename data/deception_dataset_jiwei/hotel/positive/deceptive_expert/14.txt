The anticipation of the front desk staff was the differentiator during my recent stay at this hotel. When I made my reservation, they had the foresight to inquire as to whether I was flying into Ithaca, at which point they offered to arrange their complementary shuttle to pick me up from the airport. When I arrived, I was given a packet of materials for my conference and the front desk agent was so kind to make some restaurant recommendations and print off directions for me as well. Finally, at check out, a late checkout was not a problem at all, as my meetings went into the afternoon and I couldn't leave promptly at noon. 

Truly an exceptional hotel with outstanding staff that care for their guests!
