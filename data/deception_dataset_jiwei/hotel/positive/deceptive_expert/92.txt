Having traveled the world I have never stayed on a finer concierge level.  The concierge was superb and friendly to all the guests.  The breakfast was hot and delicious.  I especially enjoyed the grits and smoked salmon.  Afternoon tea was perfect before my nap.  There never was an empty glass in the concierge parlor during the evening reception.  The spirits flowed freely and the appetizers were plentiful.  Splurge on your next stay and book on the concierge level.
