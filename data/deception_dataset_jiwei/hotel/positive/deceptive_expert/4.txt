I would never stay anywhere else! The Statler Hotel is our first choice when visit Ithaca and they always welcome us back, making it feel like our 'home away from home'. They have well-trained, smart, and friendly staff members that will go out of there way to accommate our every request. The beds and linens are the most comfortable that I have ever slept in! Staying at the Statler is well-worth the cost and they deserve every penny as everyone is hard working and pleasant. We cannot wait to return in December.
