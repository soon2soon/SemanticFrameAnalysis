Every room in The Greenwich hotel is different but similar and beautiful in its own way, with hardwood floors and moroccan tile bathrooms you feel like you are a guest in Robert De Niro's home rather than a hotel. Also, all drinks and snacks in the room are complimentary, expect alcohol. The Greenwich does not try to milk you for every penny like other NYC hotels, it invites you in and provides hospitality at its best!
