Best location in town.  This hotel is located in the middle of the historic district and is surrounded by art galleries, fine dining and shopping.  Every historic sight downtown is within walking distance of this hotel.  After dinner we would walk to the Battery and enjoy the water and beautiful homes.  The rooms are spacious and have fresh flowers.  The housekeepers are so honest that everytime I left a tip on the pillow they would make up the bed and place the tip back on the pillow.  Finally I saw the housekeeper and had to give her the tip personally before she would take the money.  Extremely friendly staff that are always eager to help with ideas, directions and reservations.
