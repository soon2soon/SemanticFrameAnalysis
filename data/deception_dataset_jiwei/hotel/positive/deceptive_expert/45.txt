My boyfriend and I kept raving the entire stay how much we loved the hotel. From the moment we arrived, we had nothing but positive things to say about the hotel and especially the staff. The decor / style of the entire facility was beautiful and our room was out of this world -- it's always a plus staying somewhere that doesn't feel like it's just a standard, chain hotel. I loved the boutique aspect and the personal touches. I don't think I could speak enough on how wonderful each and every staff member was. Every single person we encountered exceeded our expectations. Without a doubt, should we ever visit Nashville again, we will be sure to stay at the Hutton. We loved that this is the only Hutton Hotel, but part of us wishes we could stay at a Hutton in another city wherever we decide to vacation next. The Hutton Hotel team has surely raised the bar -- it will be hard to top our experience. Thank you!
