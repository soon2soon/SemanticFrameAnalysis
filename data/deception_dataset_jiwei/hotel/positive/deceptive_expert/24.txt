My husband and I stayed at The Greenwich for our 30th wedding anniversary. There was a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in the room, and the front desk greeted us knowingly. Room service was quick and delicious, as was dining at Locanda Verde. The pasta is so good! We loved getting massages at the Shibui Spa, and will recommend the hotel to all our friends. It was a very romantic stay.
