Five stars all the way!  I was here celebrating an anniversay and was just amazed at how well this hotel treated us.  We were wished a happy anniversay by at least 8 different members of the staff during our visit.  They upgraded our room to a suite and sent chocolate strawberries and champagne to the room.  We did a great couples massage in the spa and relaxed on the terrace by the pool.  Did an amazing  dinner in Herons one night and cocktails and dinner in the bar another.  What a perfect romantic weekend!
