My family and I arrived around midnight and the GSA was very curtious getting us to our room at such a late hour. After we made it to our room, we realized we needed extra pillows, which we requested and was brought to us immediatly. The rooms were immaculate and the the coffee bar areas were so nice. The overall hotel was beautiful and I would recommend to anyone a great find.
