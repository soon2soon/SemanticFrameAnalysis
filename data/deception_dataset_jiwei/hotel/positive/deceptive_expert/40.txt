Reservations staff and concierge were both especially friendly, accommodating, and professional. Didn't know Hutton was a Leading Hotel until we got to the room, and I was pleasantly surprised, and not disappointed. The little bonuses like Molton Brown bath products and excellent turn down services were appreciated.
