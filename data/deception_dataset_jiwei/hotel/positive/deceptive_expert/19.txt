We love The Statler Hotel! The students and full-time staff should be very proud of their hard work and hospitality. The valet and front desk staff are alwas very welcoming and provide prompt service with a smile. They always welcome us back, making us feel as though its our home away from home. Every room we have stayed in is always clean and well appointed. We always dine in Taverna Banfi several times during our stay and the menu options are delicious. There is truly no better place to stay in Ithaca.
