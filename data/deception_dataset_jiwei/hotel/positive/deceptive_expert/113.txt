Fernando at the concierge is the best! We traveled for the first time with our six month only boy and were hesitant about what to do in Miami. Fernando and the concierge staff centered our activities around our son, even allowing for activities where he was watched by a nanny, allowing my wife and myself to enjoy a night out on the town.
