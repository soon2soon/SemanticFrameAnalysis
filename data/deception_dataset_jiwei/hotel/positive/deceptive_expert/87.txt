The Umstead hotel was everything that a luxury hotel should be.  You would never know that it was right off the freeway as you turn in you feel like you are in another place.  Lush grounds and attentive staff.  Get a lakeview room on the second floor with an extra large terrace to relax on.  Go to the spa and order room service for the ultimate escape.  Everything about this hotel gets it right.
