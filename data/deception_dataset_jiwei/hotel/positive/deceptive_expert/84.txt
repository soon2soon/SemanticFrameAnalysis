One of my favorite spots to stay at in the south! I travel to Charleston frequently on business and whenever I can I stay at the Market Pavilion Hotel. Susanne has been there for years and always helps me secure that tough to get last minute dinner reservation. Love the large comfy beds and each room has a different original oil painting. Can't wait to stay here again!
