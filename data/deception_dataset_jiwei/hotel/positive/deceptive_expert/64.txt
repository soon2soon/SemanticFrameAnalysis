You have to stay at The Greenwich and come home to its SHIBUI SPA after a long day of walking around the city! The spa, in the basement of the hotel, has a beautiful japanese inspired pool that provides the perfect relaxation and escape from the city. Also, their red flower amenity products come into great use with their beautiful deep soaking tubs. My favorite room: Greenwich Queen Room, they all have a deep soaking bathtub!
