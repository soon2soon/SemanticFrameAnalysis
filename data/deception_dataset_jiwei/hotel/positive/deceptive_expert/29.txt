We love the rooms at The Greenwich Hotel. The beds are co comfortable, and we always request to overlook the Courtyard, which is so green and beautiful. I had a fabulous facial at the Spa, and I loved inviting my friend to have dinner with me in The Drawing Room, which was like sitting in a lovely comfortable living room by the fire. The Greenwich is the best hotel in downtown for sure. I travel a lot, and I always, recommend this hotel.
