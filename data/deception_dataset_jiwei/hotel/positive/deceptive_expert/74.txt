What a great hotel in the triangle!  This area never had a luxury hotel and they finally have a great one.  I travel for business often to the area and can't wait to return to the Umstead.  It maked business travel a pleasure and not a chore.  They always remember my name and welcome me back.  There are bartenders in the bar that know my drink and always get a great welcome back in Herons for breakfast.
