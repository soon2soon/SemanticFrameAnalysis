Recently stayed for two nights at the Market Pavillion Hotel with our friends on the Concierge Level. As always our stay was first class. From the moment you walk through the door, you and your group receive a warm welcome from the entire Market Pavillion Family. We especially enjoyed the degree of service as well as the attention to detail that we received on the Concierge Level.  Within moments of our arrival our group was taken care of for the entire stay with charm and southern hospitality. 

The staff are so nice and friendly they make you feel like you've known them for years.  I couldn't believe this hotel was only ten years old.  You would expect this kind of service at The Four Seasons or The Ritz Carlton.  Market Pavilion is the gem of Charleston.
