You hardly feel like you are in a hotel when you are at The Greenwich. It feels more like you're staying at a welcoming relatives luxurious home. We loved dining in the serine couryard, and especially loved the extra deep soaking tun made of marble in our Studio Suite. The staff was so lovely, and we loved staying in lower Manhattan for the first time. We will come again!
