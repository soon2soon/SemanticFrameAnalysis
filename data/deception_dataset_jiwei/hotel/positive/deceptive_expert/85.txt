Pros: perfect location right in the center of everything, beautifully appointed rooms and public areas, fresh flowers in guestroom, fitness center, and five star restaurant in the lobby.

Cons: Coffee is taken away on the floor in the afternoon, would have liked to have a cup before going out.

All in all we loved this hotel and would recommend to our friends and family.
