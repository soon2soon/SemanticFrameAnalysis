Five stars!!!!  You must stay at this hotel while visiting Charleston.  I cannot say enough good things about The Market Pavilion Hotel.  My girfriends and I planned a girls weekend and we were treated like queens by the staff.   From the Hermes bath products to the bathrobes and slippers laid out during turndown service the amenities were luxurious and of the finest quality.  The rooftop bar is such a fun and happening place on the weekends with a live DJ.  Dining at Grill 225 was like dining in the finest NY steakhouse.  You don't even have to leave this hotel for fun, food and entertainment.
