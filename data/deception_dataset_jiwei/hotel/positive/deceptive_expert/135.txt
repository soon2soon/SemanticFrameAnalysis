The Setai Fifth Avenue made our wedding anniversary very special.  I promised Ashley (front desk agent) that we will stay at the Setai every year to celebrate.  The rooms are spacious and they greet us by name everytime we arrive from shopping.  The welcome amenity (free Champagne!) made our stay even better!
