We decided to stay at The Umstead Hotel and Spa on our wedding night because of its proximity to the airport.  We had an early flight out the next day and wanted to be close since we live about an hour from RDU.  We couldn't have picked a better spot!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like absolute royalty.  Everyone we encountered knew it was our wedding night and made every attempt to make it special for us.  From the amenity in our guest room, the prompt wake-up call and the car waiting for us in the morning to whisk us away, we weren't there for long but they certainly wowed us!  My only regret is that we didn't spend a day or two of our honeymoon with them.  We will be back, maybe on our 1st anniversary!
