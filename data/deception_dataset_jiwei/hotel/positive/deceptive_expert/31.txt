My husband and I just returned from a weekend getaway at The Umstead.  It was heaven on earth!  We only live 15 minutes from The Umstead and never really considered staying there, but it was so convenient for a quick trip!  The staff is incredible, consistently using our names and the facilities are outstanding, so modern and elegant.  We dined in The Bar and Lounge because Herons was full (negative if you plan last minute), and the food was tasty although a bit difficult to eat in the furniture that we were seated in.  Overall though, The Umstead treats you like a million bucks and we will definitely be back the next time our schedule permits!
