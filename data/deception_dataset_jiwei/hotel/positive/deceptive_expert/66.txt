The Greenwich has everything going for it, a Tribeca location, Robert De Niro as an owner, and Andrew Cremillini as a chef. The decor makes you feel like you are in a cozy/sheek home. The rooms are all different, each with duxiana beds, which are extremely comfortable! They will put a mattress pad on the bed if you prefer a stiffer mattress. Additionally, we were in house for a long term stay. Therefore, prior to our arrival we were reached out to to ask if we would like an extra mini refridgerator in the room and if there were any groceries that we would like stocked. When we arrived into our Suite (book the fireplace corner suites, they have views of the hudson river and working fireplaces!). When we arrived all of our requested groceries were in the refridgerator, and a beautiful fruit bowl and bottle of red wine were on the table. This is the welcome of a hotel who knows how to do it right!
