This is the only hotel in the historic district with a pool which is important when traveling with kids.  The lounge chairs have terrycloth covers and plenty of plush beach towels are provided for the guests.  The rooftop bar offers not only cool drinks but a variety of choices on the menu.  I had the Kobe burger and it was so large I couldn't even finish half of my burger.  Staff is attentive to your every need.  We didn't spend much time in the rooms but they even had childrens bathrobes laid out for the kids with slippers.  Too cute!!!  When staying in Charleston you couldn't choose a finer hotel.
