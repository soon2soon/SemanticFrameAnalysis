The Greenwich is the best downtown hotel in NYC!  We stayed at The Greenwich with our two children. The staff was extremely accomodating for our family stay. They welcomed our kids with delicious oatmeal cookies and adoreable stuffed animals in the room when they arrived as well as a bottle of wine for us! We found the hotel perfect for our stay as Tribeca is an extremely kid friendly neighborhood. The Front Desk staff even gave us a list of kid frienly activities in the area and they will assist with babysitting services as well! For uptown activities it was a very quick cab ride up the West Side Highway and we are so glad that we stayed downtown at The Greenwich. We are looking forward to our next stay!
