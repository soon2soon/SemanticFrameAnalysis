I cannot describe how beautiful the view was from my corner suite! It is well-worth the cost. The service and smiles match the calliber of the view. It's the perfect place to stay as I always have many meetings on campus. The valet is very helpful, especially when I need my car promptly. I am always impressed with every area of the hotel!
