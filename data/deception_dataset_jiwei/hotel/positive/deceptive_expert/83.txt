We stayed here a few weeks ago and had a nice stay. We did run into a problem with our reservation when we checked in; we had originally booked a king bed room but they had us in a room with two queen beds. After speaking to a manager the problem was resolved though and we actually received an upgrade to the top floor! The pool on the rooftop is beautiful  but get there early as it does tend to get busy at the bar in the afternoon. Overall my husband and I had a great time and would stay here again if we ever return to Charleston.
