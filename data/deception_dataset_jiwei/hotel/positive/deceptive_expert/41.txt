Laura in Concierge went above and beyond making recommendations and reservations. The chocolate covered strawberries in our room upon arrival (for my mom's 70th Birthday) was the beginning of an incredible stay. We enjoyed the ambiance of the bar over bottle of Champagne. We are in the airline industry and stay in Hotels around the world but Your hotel offers decor, amenities and customer service that we havent experienced in years. Bravo! We will highly recommend your hotel and look forward to our next stay.
