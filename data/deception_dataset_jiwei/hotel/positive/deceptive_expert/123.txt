After checking in to the Hutton, I noticed that my wallet was missing. Before I paniced, I contacted the front desk. The GSA confirmed that my wallet was safe and was being held in a safe downstairs.. Once I retrieved my wallet, I realized that honesty in this day and time was worth my business anyday.
