Driving up to The Setai you wouldn't think much about the plain white building but once you walk inside you are transported into another world.  Leave behind the hustle and bustle of Collins Avenue and go to this Sanctuary.  Every need was tended to with speed and precision. I didn't need to leave the resort to have everything I needed.
