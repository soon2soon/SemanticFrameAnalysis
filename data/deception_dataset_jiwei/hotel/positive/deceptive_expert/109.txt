I stayed at the Hotel over Art Basel week. I spent a lot of time out of the hotel but every time I came back it was like coming home. Even when there were events taking place, I was always greeted in the Lobby and welcomed back. Even on the busiest weekend I was never made to wait and service was flawless.
