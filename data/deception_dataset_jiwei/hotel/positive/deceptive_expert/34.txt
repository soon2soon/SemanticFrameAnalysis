It's not every day that you get to experience a five star hotel, especially right in your own backyard.  I am well travelled, and have stayed at many Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Montage, etc. and I can wholeheartedly say, The Umstead tops them all!  The thing that sets them apart is the staff.  They seem to genuinely care and seem overwhelmingly enthusiastic to help make your stay more comfortable.  The art, furnishings, dining and accommodations earn them their stars, but I believe that their staff solidifies them!
