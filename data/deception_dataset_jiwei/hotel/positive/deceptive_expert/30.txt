I can't get over the bathroom we had in our room during our recent stay at The Greenwich Hotel. Bright blue and green Moroccan tile that just made every morning and night feel so luxurious. Room service was very quick, and the hotel has a really easy, nice vibe to it. I wish I had been able to stay longer!
