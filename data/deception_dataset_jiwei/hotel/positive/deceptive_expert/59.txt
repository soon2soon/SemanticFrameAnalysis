We checked in to The Umstead after a long drive from Washington D.C.  We were visiting my sister-in-law who lives nearby and she recommended the hotel to us.  We had our 2 small children with us and our family dog, so needless to say we were ready to check in and get to our suite!  As soon as we pulled up to the front entrance we were greeted by the friendiest valet and door men who greeted our kids with little stuffed toys and immediately we knew we were in for a treat!  While we didn't get to spend much time in the hotel since we were visiting family, I can say that The Umstead makes every guest feel special and the surroundings are the cherry on top!
