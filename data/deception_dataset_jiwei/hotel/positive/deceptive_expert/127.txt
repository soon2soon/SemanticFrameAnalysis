We had our wedding at the Hutton hotel. The banquet space had an amazing view of downtown Nashville. Everything I wanted from my reception, I received. The service and food was amazing. We ended up staying in one of the suites. The showers are amazing and loved the tv's in the bathroom mirrors. Complimentry breakfast was delicious. A great place to spend a memorable moment.
