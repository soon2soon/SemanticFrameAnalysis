I travelled to New York often for business and our company has a special rate at another chain hotels but I got sick and tired of the same decor and size of the rooms and decided to change.  I found the Setai Fifth Avenue online.  The rate is reasonable for 5 Star Hotel that offers large size of guestrooms, free internet, sodas and water replenished every day and Maserati car service for free anywhere in Manhattan is a great deal!  I will return soon!
