The best part about The Greenwich is that the Courtyard and Drawing Room are for guests only, therefore you do not have to fight anyone to use the spaces in your own hotel. Both spaces are stunning with delicious food by Locanda Verde and a fantastic unassuming staff. Do not stay anywhere else, make The Greenwich your second home in NYC, you will want to make it your permanat home and never leave!
