I really enjoyed our recent visit to campus to visit our freshman daughter. We were upgraded to a room with a view of campus and the clock tower that was spectacular! We also had a great meal in the restaurant at the hotel, the lobster risotto was out of this world. All in all, another great stay at the Statler, we'll see you in March!
