I have just returned home from a lovely stay at The Statler Hotel! We enjoyed our stay from the moment we were greeted by the swift valet until we checked out with the friendly and efficient front desk staff. Throughout our stay we had delicious food at Taverna Banfi several times; breakfast, lunch, and dinner were always served with a smile (I loved the salmon!). The Regent Lounge has been recently renovated and we LOVE the outcome, great work Statler. The Statler Hotel continues to wow us and it is truly a pleasure to see the Hotel students blossom into hospitality leaders. Keep up the great work, we look forward to returning!
