My wife and I recently decided to stay at The Umstead for a special treat during the week for some quality time.  We were expecting to just hideaway and enjoy our room, but it ended up just the opposite!  From the moment we arrived we were in awe of the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to recommend different things to us.  We ended up having dinner in Herons followed by a night cap by the outdoor fireplace. It was lovely.  You can tell that this hotel definitely caters to a business traveller due to its location, but they've also mastered how to welcome leisure guests too.  We will definitely be back!
