I recently stayed at The Statler to attend a conference with the department of anthropology at Cornell University. I was impressed with the students who run the hotel, as it was quite surprising to know that so many students are interested in hospitality and even more specifically delivering great service at this hotel. It was also most convenient to stay here, as the hotel is perfectly situated on campus for all of my meetings. I will say that although I was not paying for the room, the rate does seem a bit steep!
