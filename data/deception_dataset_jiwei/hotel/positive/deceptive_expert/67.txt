My husband and I decided to do a "staycation" for our anniversary this year. We chose The Greenwich because we live uptown and figured downtown would be a fun change. When we arrived to the hotel, the staff warmly welcomed us by saying happy anniversary! Our room was not quite ready, as we arrived around 2 pm and check in is after 4pm but the bellmen kindly held our luggage as we cozied up in the Drawing Room. What a beautiful quiet space! The fire was roaring and we had delicious house made cocktails as we waited. Try their Pimms Cup, they add ginger beer, the best Pimms Cup I've ever had! The staff checked us in around 3 pm and gave us a nice tour of our room, where a complimentary bottle of champagne was waiting! 

Also, have a couple's massage in their Shibui Spa, it is a great way to share your anniversary! We both had the healing birch, it was fantastic. I hear that the Shibui Spa is now open to the public, as New Yorkers we will definitely be back!
