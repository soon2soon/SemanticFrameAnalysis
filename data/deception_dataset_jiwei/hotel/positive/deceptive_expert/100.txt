Fantastic Trip of A Lifetime!  The Market Pavlion is a small boutique hotel. The same staff took care of us everyday of our three day stay. This is a plus for me. It gives the hotel the feel of of an old world private club. Everyone knew our names and truly were glad to see us.  The staff is so eager to help you enjoy your visit to Charleston with suggestions of places to see and things to do.  From the doorman to the bartender and everyone in between the staff is top notch.  The rooftop bar is great for drinks and the view. The pool is small but great for sun bathing or cooling off. 

The rooms are spacious, clean and have a great view of the market.  We had adjourning rooms and the adjourning doors were open prior to our arrival.  The kids enjoyed going down to visit the concierge who would tell them stories about Charleston, the aquarium, boat tours, candy stores, etc.  She helped us plan a kid friendly trip and even knew which restaurants nearby had childrens menus.  

Will save up our money for a return trip.  Well worth the price because your trip will be memorable.
