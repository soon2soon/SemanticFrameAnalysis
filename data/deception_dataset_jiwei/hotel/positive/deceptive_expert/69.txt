I was looking for a go-to hotel in New York that could be my home away from home when I frequently travel to NYC for business and/or also for leisure. The Greenwich meets all of our expectations. On the business side, i is a great homey place to come back to after a day of work and to have a breakfast meeting in their guest only Drawing Room. It is also extremely romantic as well as kid friendly. I brought my wife here for a long NYC weekend and she loved it. If you stay as a guest you will always get a hard-to-get reservation at Locanda Verde and during the warmer weather you can have this meal in their peaceful Courtyard. It is also extremely close to both FIDI and SOHO/West Village so the location could not be better! Make The Greenwich your Go-to, you can't beat it!
