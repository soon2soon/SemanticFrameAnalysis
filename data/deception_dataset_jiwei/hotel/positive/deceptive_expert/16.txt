The Statler Hotel is the best place to stay in Ithaca! The service and location are excellent. We always dine at Taverna Banfi and the food is delicious, the pork sandwich is amazing! The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the housekeepers are efficient and friendly. Keep up the good work, we can't wait to return.
