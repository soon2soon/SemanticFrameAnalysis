I stayed at The Setai for work. We had several small meetings in the hotel over the course of a few days.  The weather was rainy and gloomy but the hotel was still hustling and bustling.  The Setai team was there to handle every request and the meetings were a big success. I would definitely recommend The Setai to my friends and family. Next time I come back it will be for pleasure and not business!
