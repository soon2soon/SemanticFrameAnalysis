The Greenwich makes you feel like you are a guest in their home. Request a courtyard facing room, it looks over their beautiful courtyard which provides serenity away from the busy city life. The Front Desk staff is very helpful, the coordinated and reccomended fantastic dinners during my stay. Will definitely be back!
