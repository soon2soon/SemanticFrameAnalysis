The Greenwich Hotel + Locanda Verde = heaven! Stay here and cozy up in the Courtyard while eating Andrew Carmellini's incredible pasta. The Courtyard is for guests only. You feel as though you are in the courtyard of a tuscan villa. Also, the Front Desk staff is young, personable, and professional. They project only warmth and great hospitality unlike many other downtown hotels who portray an unwanted attitude. We cannot wait to come back for our next NYC trip!
