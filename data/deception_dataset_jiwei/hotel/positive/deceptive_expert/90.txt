The Umstead definitely exceeded my expectations in all areas.  The doorman always opened the door and greeted me by name each time.  The front desk staff we most helpful and efficient.  The breakfast servers in Herons were very attentive and room service was always on time-which is rare in a hotel.  Room was clean and refreshed every day and turn down was a nice touch.  It just seems like they have thought of everything.  Thank you for providing a wonderful experience.
