Recently my husband returned from deployment and I wanted to do something special to mark the occassion.  A friend of mine  had recommened The Umstead to us and I am so glad she did.  All of the staff was warm and friendly without being pushy and we always felt like things were taken care of.  I booked us a couples massage in the spa which was such a treat.  We never do things like this so it was a real treat and we felt like it was worth every penny!  We ordered in-room dining to make the most out of our time in the beautiful suite we had and it was as though we had our own private restaurant.  They come and set up a beautfiul little table (with a flower centerpiece) and truly make it feel so quaint and special and not like "room service".  The next day before we departed we took advantage of the complimentary steam and sauna because we didn't want the stay to end.  I would highly recommend The Umstead to anyone needing some R&R.
