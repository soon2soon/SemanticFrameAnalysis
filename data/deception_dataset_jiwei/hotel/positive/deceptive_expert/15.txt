My husband and I returned to campus to visit as alumni and decided to stay at the Statler to try it out for once. It was really cool to see the students working at the hotel and to speak to them about our times at school and how it has changed. They are all so interested in helping us in anyway they could. They even arranged a wine tour route for the two of us to explore and taste some local wines at vineyards in the surrounding area. It was great to be back on campus and staying at the Statler was the cherry on top of it all!
