We never heard of The Setai but after our friends suggested it, we decided to give it a try. We were most impressed with the way we were treated by all the staff members. After our fist night, everyone knew who were were and called us by name. There were other guests at the hotel but somehow, we felt like we were the only ones in the eyes of the staff. Impeccable attention to detail. The Spa is a must try!!
