We live in Miami and frequent The Setai for dinner, brunch and the occasional overnight stay.  The company recently underwent a management change but you could not tell from the service and quality.  We still see many familiar faces and are greeted warmly every time we arrive. If you havent visited The Setai yet, make it a priority!
