Treated my wife to a special anniversary gift this past weekend with a night's stay at the Market Pavilion. Found the service and room to be truly first class. We really felt like we were receiving authentic southern hospitality. Allyssa at check in was very efficient and helpful. Haven, the doorman, also went above and beyond to make our stay unique and special. We will be back again next year!
