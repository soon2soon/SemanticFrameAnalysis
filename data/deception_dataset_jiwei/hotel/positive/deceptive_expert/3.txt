The Statler Hotel provides top notch service in every area of the hotel! The area that I was particularly impressed with is the Front Desk team. They took the time to talk to myself and my prospective student and answer all of our questions. They informed us of what to see on campus and recommended a few fantastic restaurants in town (including Taverna Banfi, located right at the hotel). We were truly impressed how sincere and well trained everyone is. Keep up the good work and we hope to return soon!
