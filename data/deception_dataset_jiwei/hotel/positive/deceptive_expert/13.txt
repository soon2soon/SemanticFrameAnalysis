I am currently writing this review from my room at the hotel as I stare out at the beautiful view of the lake and campus! The hotel is outstanding, the rooms are recently refurbished and I have really enjoyed the trendy lobby bar that has a great drink selection. I was impressed that when I notified the hotel of my severe feather allergy, that they assured me my room would be feather-free and sure enough, when I arrived early at 11 in the morning, there was no wait to get into my room that had been specially prepared for me, truly impressive!
