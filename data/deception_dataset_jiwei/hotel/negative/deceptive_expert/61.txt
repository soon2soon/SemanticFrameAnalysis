It took me a week to calm down before I could write this review.  My stay was so horrible that I honestly will never stay at another Renaissance hotel anywhere.  My room was dirty, no ifs ands or buts about it, it was dirty.  When I called to the desk to complain and request a room change they apologized and offered to send someone right up.  When the housekeeper arrived she confessed that they never cleaned the room and that they shouldn't have checked me into it.  I felt so gross and felt I should get compensated in some way.  Unfortunately the manager couldn't do anything.  They were sold out so there were no available rooms to move me to, so I had to wait it out with one glass of wine as an apology.  I really think this place needs to reconsider how it handles its customers!
