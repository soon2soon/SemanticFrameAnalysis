The entire experience was a disaster! From front desk to the restaurant the staff was very unprofessional and I heard a lot of gossiping and complaining about other guests. This made me feel very uncomfortable as I wondered if they spoke about me. Where are the supervisors and managers that watch over the staff members? The room was a standard, 'run of the mill' room. The staff and room have turned me away from wanted to return to the Hilton.
