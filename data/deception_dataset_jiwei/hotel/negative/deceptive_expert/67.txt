Better options in downtown NYC, this hotel does not provide the service to be expected at a top rated hotel. When we arrived there were no bellmen to assist with luggage in sight. After we lugged our wee's work of luggage through the door, we then waited at the reception desk for at least 10 minutes while two receptionists were assisting one guest.  They seemed to be having more of a pow-wow. You would think that they at leask would have acknowleged us? The rooms are a bit uninteresting, clean and fine enough but little effort seemed to be put into the design. I like the idea of boutique hotels but when they do not provide the service it is extremely dissapointing.
