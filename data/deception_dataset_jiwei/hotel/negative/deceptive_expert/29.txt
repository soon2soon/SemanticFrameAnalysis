I was not impressed with the amenities at this Soho Hotel. And I thought the staff was a bit unfriendly. I am accustomed to having a gym in my hotel, and I thought it was an inconvenience to have to travel elsewhere. The beds were not very comfortable, unfortunately, and there was a problem with my reservation when I arrived. All and all, I did not feel like it was a great experience.
