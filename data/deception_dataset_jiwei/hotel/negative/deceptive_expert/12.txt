I was disapointed with the Hilton from the moment I walked in. There was no valet to greet me and the front desk had a bad attitude and did not answer my questions. The room was dusty and made me sneeze all night. However, the housekeeper did have a pleasant attitude when she entered the room. The parking situation was a nightmare with the garage across the road closed. I will never stay at the Hilton again and would advise others not to as well.
