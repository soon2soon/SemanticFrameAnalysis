After checking into the Lowes in Nashville, the front desk associate made a racial comment as I was getting my room key. I requested to speak with a manager, and the gentlemen told me that I needed to go through him first. Not only was I offended, but I requested that the room to be cancelled and my full refund return. Tom assured me that there was no way a full refund was optional. I sat in the lobby and contacted corporate.Joe was very helpful however was told the same ol, same ol.., "We will get back to you". Never heard a word and half of my deposit was returned.
