The Hilton has a nice enterance and I was checked in to an ok room (a little too close to the elevator though). When I asked for recommendations for dining the first option the front desk gave me was Kilpatricks which is located in the hotel. Upon entering I was impressed with the layout and the interesting booths but this is where my pleasure stopped. As soon as I sat down I could hear the table next to my complain about their dished to the waitress. She then got her manager and she was very unhospitable to the couple! She didn't even comp a meal, she basicall said 'deal with it'. Isn't the customer always right? That manager was a poor example to her wait staff and is clearly in the wrong industry. My food was ok but I feel that I should have went and dined somewhere else on the Commons. The rooms could use a facelift and they should really get rid of the duvets! Overall, I was VERY unimpressed with my stay and will find a better value for my money elsewhere.
