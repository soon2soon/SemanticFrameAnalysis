While the hotel staff was friendly enough, the room itself really needed some upgrades. The carpet looked worn and old, the room had a very unusual odor that lingered even after turndown service, dust found in the corners and crevices of the room. Housekeeping really seems to be doing just the bare minimum and not looking for any type of attention to detail. We were very disappointed in our stay.
