On our trip to Miami we stopped in the St Regis to see this new property we had heard so much about. The decor is gorgeous, almost too much.  But the valet was so slow with our car I thought they might have stolen it! Who takes that long to drive a car around the corner?  Never again will I go there unless it is in a taxi.
