I thought I was going to have a relaxing massage at the spa, unfortunately my interpretation of relaxing was quite different from Sandra's (my therapist). Sandra wore squeaky shoes that made a horribly loud noise each time she took a step in my cold treatment room. I had my face down when I asked her to make the room a little warmer. The only thing I heard were her squeaky shoes and the temperature did not change.
