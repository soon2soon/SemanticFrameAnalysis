I recently took my wife on an anniversary getaway. Upon making my reservation, I was assured I would receive a complimentary upgrade since we would be celebrating a special occasion. This did not happen. Our room was fine but we received no special amenities, chocolate covered strawberries, nothing. It was a bit of a let down. From there things just kept getting worse: no hot water, when we called to get this fixed we were told maint. would not be in until the morning. Room service pricing was ridiculous, we ended up just looking for our own breakfast in the morning. We had a early flight and asked for a wake up call that we never received. We almost missed our flight. Beware; if you are looking for anything other than a bed to lie your head down, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
