I stay on a regular basis. At least one week every other month. Every time I check in I get asked the same question, "Is this your first stay with us?" No, in fact it's my 100th. Please implement some sort system so that you know which room I like, what paper I want and that I do have a car (every time). Keep my credit card on file - I use the same one every time.
