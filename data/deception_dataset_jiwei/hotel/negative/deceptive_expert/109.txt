My family has many special requests and I understand that at times there are difficult to fulfill. One of our biggest concerns is my son's dietary restrictions.  He cannot eat gluten or dairy.  The restaurant struggled to provide us with options other than plain chicken and vegetables.  Not only that but every time we ordered anything I  had to repeat all of these restrictions to the server and they mistakenly served him a soup that was cream based after we were informed there was no dairy!
