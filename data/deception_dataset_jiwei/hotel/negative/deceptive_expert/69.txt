If you are looking for an unattentive and snooty staff, overpriced drinks, and a sterile enviornment than you have come to the right place. Do not waste your money here, there are so many other better options at downtown hotels in NYC. We finally got a seat at the bar after waiting for 30 + minutes as in house guests and did not recieve the welcome expected. The bartender seemed more interested in a group of hip people who did not seem like they were staying there. I am not an attention seeker but as an in house guest, you would think that we would get a little bit of special treatment. Such as, I think they should reserve some space for guests only as I do not think I should have to fight a crowd to get a seat at my own hotel's lounge.
