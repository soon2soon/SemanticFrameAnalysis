My wife and I went to the St Regis for our 2nd anniversary.  It was a big deal for us because we would normally not spend this kind of money on a hotel.  We were disappointed and I felt like I would have had better service in a better location at the W South Beach.  Lessoned learnt. Dont make the same mistake we did.
