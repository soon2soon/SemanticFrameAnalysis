I enjoy the Renaissance brand and didn't hesitate to book this hotel for my upcoming trip to the area.  I was highly disappointed with the accommodations though.  My room overlooked a busy highway which considering the quaint location of North Hills, was a supreme disappoinment.  I found the room to be noisy and lack any special qualities.  I think this was a terrible lack of planning to build an expensive hotel overlooking a busy highway.
