I booked this hotel because I had heard that it was "the place to stay in NYC". This is certainly NOT "the place to stay" it is an absoloute rip-off and the service is horrible. Staff has a "too cool" attitude and the rooms are uninteresting. I found a stain in my sheets upon arrival and therefore I called housekeeping to complain and they did not even apologize. They then took an hour to come up and service my room. For the $800.00 per night I was paying I found this to be insulting and extremely dissapointing.
