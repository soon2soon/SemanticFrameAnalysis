We were extremely pleased with our beautiful cabana and the service. After enjoying a day out by the pool, we decided to use the shower in the cabanas. I guess they had not been used for a few days and when my wife turned the shower on, she got a steady flow of rust in the water. 
The experience turned even more sour when the staff joked about the situation and expressed concern for the towels which had turned orange. 
I was expecting more empathy and a better resolution rather than simply allowing us to return to our rooms to take a shower.
