For the amount of service we received, we should have payed a holiday inn rate. Instead, we payed $300.00 for a so so room and so so service. This would have been fine if we did not have the expectation of a luxury hotel. Hotel soap, conditioner was cheap, and they did not have any shoe shining capabilities. Valet service was slow and we received no explanation for having to wait 30 minutes for our car.
