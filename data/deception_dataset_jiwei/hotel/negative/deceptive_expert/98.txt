Choose another hotel for your stay in Charleston.  At checkin we were told our room wasn't ready even though checkin is guaranteed at 3:00pm and it was 5:00 pm.  We waited another thirty minutes for our room.  No apologies were offered to us.  The only comment was "we had a lot of check outs today".  Upon entering the room there wasn't any towels in the bathroom nor toiletries.   It took another thirty minutes for our luggage to arrive in our room.  The mattress was lumpy and worn out.  The linens on the bed were thread bare.  The Days Inn would have been a step up from this hotel.
