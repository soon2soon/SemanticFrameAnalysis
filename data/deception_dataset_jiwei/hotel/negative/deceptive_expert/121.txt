I would not recomment the Lowes Hotel in Nashville, TN. They checked us in to the wrong room, which has already been occupied by someone else. After confronting the front desk, not only were they rude but didnt offer any type of apology for the mishaps. The rooms where not as clean has expected, however the location was ok.
