The French Quarter Inn has a lot lacking.  The rooms are dingy and the carpets could use a good cleaning.  I wouldn't walk barefoot in our room and always had on shoes.  Definitely could use a complete overhaul and reburbish the rooms.  We found a cockroach in our bathroom that was still alive.  When we called the froont desk to complain they told us that it was a palmetto bug and that was normal for Charleston. We couldn't sleep at night because of all of the loud partying on the street outside.  There are too many bars around this hotel that play loud music until 2:00 am.  The rooms should be sound proofed better.  Management informed us they could not move us to another room.  No compensation was made for our poor experience at the hotel.
