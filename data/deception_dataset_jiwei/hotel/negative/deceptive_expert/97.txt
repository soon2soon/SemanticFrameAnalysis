I planned a romantic getaway at the French Quarter Inn to propose to my girlfriend.  I had contacted the concierge and had asked that upon our arrival the following items to be placed in our room.  Bottle of Moet et Chandon, chocolate covered strawberries, Charcuterie & Cheese Plate and two dozen roses.  When we arrived none of the items I ordered were  in the room.  The staff couldn't find any record of the items I had ordered even though my credit card had been charged for all of the above.   It took two hours for them to rectify the error and the management did not offer any apology for the concierge's mistake.  This was the start to the worst romantic getaway I ever experienced.
