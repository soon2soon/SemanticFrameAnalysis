I will never stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again. We visited last weekend as part of the Cornell class reunions and were hysterical when we found bed bugs in our room! The hotel only offered to change the sheets and would not let us move rooms as they did not have any other available rooms during our stay. Having no other choices, we slept with the bugs... It would have been nice if they had arranged for an exterminator to come clean our room when the problem was found, but I guess that would have been too much work for the staff.
