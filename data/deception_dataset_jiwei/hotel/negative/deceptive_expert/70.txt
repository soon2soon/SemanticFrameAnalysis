Do not waste your time with this hotel, for my husband's 40th birthday I booked the Studio room, which was lovely. I let them know ahead of time and asked to put champagne in the room. This was not done, I kindly called because I was hoping they could just bring it up then. There was no apology but it was brought up relatively promptly. At the end of our stay $150 was charged to our bill for the champagne which initally came across as complimentary when the reservationist asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. We did not say anything I just think that is portrays poor hospitality and communication. Also, we had them book a meal for us at Del Posto (which was delicious by the way!!) for the evening of my husband's birthday. The concierge confirmed 7:30 to us but when we arrived to the restaurant they had us in for 6:30? Luckily even though they were packed the restaurant had us sit at the bar for a drink and got us in by 8:15. This was a big mistake of the concierge's part, lucky for them that Del Posto was so accomodating. If you stay at the Mercer double check with the restaurant what time your reservation is yourself!!
