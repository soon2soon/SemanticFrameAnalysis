I should have known when I booked my reservation that the French Quarter Inn was a poor choice. The reservationist made me feel like my questions were stupid and she tried to get me off the phone as soon as possible. Valet service is slow and at $20.00, not worth it. If you can just take a taxi or pedicab and leave your vehicle at home. We found a palmetto bug in our room and when we contacted the front desk they informed us that these are found in all hotels in the south. I'm pretty sure any luxury hotel will not be crawling with bugs. We will never ever return to this "hotel".
