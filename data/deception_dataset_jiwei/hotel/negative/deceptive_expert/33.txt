This is a friend's favorite place to stay in NYC, so I was really looking forward to my experience, but I could not have been more disappointed. The room felt dirty and dark, the front desk did not have any new, exciting suggestions for dining that I did not already know, and in general, the furniture, including the bed, was not comfortable. The restaurant was okay, dinner better than lunch, but for the price, I wanted a much better experience than what I got. I was expecting luxury, but I got ordinary.
