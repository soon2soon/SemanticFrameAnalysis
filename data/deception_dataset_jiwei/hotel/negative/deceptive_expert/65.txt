Do not stay here, there is an attitude of the front desk staff that will make you want to run out the door!! This is not what I expected from supposedly one of NYC's best hotels?The rooms are fine, nothing extremely special and a nice lobby but the staff was too busy snickering behind the desk and perching their lips with their overly trendy looks to have interest in the guests. I simply found them unwelcoming and unapproachable. I even heard them talking badly about another guest, how very unprofessional! Too bad because the location is great if you want to be in the heart of soho shopping, its just not where I would want to call my home when visting NYC.
