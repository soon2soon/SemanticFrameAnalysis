If you are traveling for work I would definitely not stay at the French Quarter Inn.  The free WIFI never works.  Of course the staff blamed it on the type of tablet I had but while talking to other guests they couldn't pick up the WIFI either.  Not being able to work from my hotel room when I had meeetings scheduled in Charleston was disastrous for my business.  In order to work I had to go to a nearby restaurant that offered free WIFI.
