The Loews Hotel's location is great but the overall service of the hotel was a disapointment. We listened to housekeepers argue on the way to our room. Once we made it, the room was not as clean as expected. After requesting a new room, they mentioned that no other room was available. We requested a discount and was denied. Next time we will stay down the street.
