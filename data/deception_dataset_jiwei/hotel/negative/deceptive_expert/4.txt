Paying more than $200/night, I expected to have a better than average stay and interaction at the Hilton Garden Inn. However, this was unfortunately not the case. Our room was not ready until 5:00pm (2 hours after guaranteed check-in) and even though we notified the front desk that we were on a tight schedule (visiting our son for parent's weekend at his fraternity) no particular urgency was seen on their part or alternative services offered to store our bags or assist us in any way until our room was ready 3 hours after we arrived. Needless to say, I will seek other accommodations next time we come to Ithaca.
