We live an hour from Raleigh and thought it would be fun to do some shopping and dining in the area for a little staycation.  The location of Renaissance was perfect.  Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about our stay - as the rest of the experience was just so so.  We didn't experience any try guest service and I'm not sure how they can be considered four diamond when they barely look at you when you are speaking to them.  Yes the rooms are large and comfortable, but it is the people that truly make the place and I would say they need to do some serious training!
