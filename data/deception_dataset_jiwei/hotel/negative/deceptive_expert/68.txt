I booked a Courtyard room at the Mercer but when I arrived they had me in for a Deluxe room. It was just me for this stay therefore I did not need a Deluxe which I have stayed in there a few times before. When I arrived they told me that I was in a Deluxe room. I said that I booked a Couryard for this stay so it must be a mistake. They claimed that this had been changed and unfortunately they were sold out and did not have a Courtyard room to put me in. I figured that this may be an upgrade due to their availability but when I checked out they charged me the full price of a Deluxe room and began to argue that I had changed the room type. This to me was terrible customer service and extremely disrespectful to accuse me of something that I did not do. Eventually they removed the charge but it was handled extremely poorly. Although I always enjoyed my stays at The Mercer I do not want to deal with their staff again, therefore will not be returning.
