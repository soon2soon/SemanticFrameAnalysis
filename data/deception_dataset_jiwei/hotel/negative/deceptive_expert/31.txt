I just stayed at this hotel, and I wish that the website had given better pictures of the rooms, because I found ours to be so small, and there was a big stain on our couch in the room. It just did not feel taken care of, and little things like clean towels being replenished at night did not happen. I was surpised because I usually like Andre Balaz's properties, but this was a let down.
