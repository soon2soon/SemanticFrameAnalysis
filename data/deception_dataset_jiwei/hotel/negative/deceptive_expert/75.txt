Stayed here for a conference and it was a very bad experience.  The food for the conference was not edible and they ran out of multiple items for lunch.  No one ever came in to clean the meeting rooms and there were dirty dishes from breakfast at 5:00p!  Don't know if they were understaffed or did not care, but either way it shows.
