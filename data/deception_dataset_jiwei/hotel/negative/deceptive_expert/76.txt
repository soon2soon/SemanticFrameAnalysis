Worst hotel in Charleston.  Upon arrival we waited ten minutes for someone to valet our car.  The bellman was rude when he removed our luggage from our car and even complained he couldn't believe he had to unload all of the luggage for a two night stay.  When we approached the front desk to check-in they could not find our reservation.  After arguing that we DID have a reservation at their hotel we had to show them the print out of our e-mail confirmation before they could find our room in their system.  Once checked in we went to our room and did not receive the champagne and lady fingers as promised on their website.  I just wanted to take a quick shower and a nap after our long trip.  When I pulled back the sheets on the bed there were blood stains on the sheets.  Of course their response was that's impossible.  Only after a 45 min wait for the manager to call me back and then another 30 min after that did we get clean sheets put on the bed.  Couldn't wait to leave this hotel.
