I chose the Mercer hotel after a recommendation by a friend. I normally stay at a different downtown location but my friend persuaded me to stay here with her so I tought I should try it. Prior to my stay I was particularly impressed with the amenity list, ie same day pressing service, day passes to soho equinox, etc. Unfortuately these did not live up to my expectations! I called for pressing service in the morning as I was headed to the event that I came to NYC for. It took them an hour to pick it up (I called at 6:30 am to ensure that it would be ready by that evening), afer I had to call and remind them. Then, I told them that it absoloutly had to be ready at 6:30. At 6:45 when I called down they claimed that they did not have a piece of laundry for me, We went back and forth for an hour and it was still not found...this obviosuly made me late to my event with nothing to wear, the dress was finally found the next morning, aparently it had been marked as next day service. DO NOT OFFER SERVICES IF YOU CAN'T PROVIDE THEM! The rest of my stay was fine, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth to spend that kind of money on a hotel that provides unreliable service.
