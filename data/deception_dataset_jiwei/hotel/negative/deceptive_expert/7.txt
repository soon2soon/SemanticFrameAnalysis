When we arrived to check-in at the hotel, we were downgraded from our whirlpool suite to a traditional room for no apparent reason. The manager apologized and assured us that our room rate had been "significantly" reduced to make up for the oversight, however, it was "significantly" reduced to the best available rate for the traditional room type that I could have booked online. Otherwise, the stay was fine and the staff was nice enough, but you guarantee your room reservation with a credit card for a reason, to make sure you get that room!
