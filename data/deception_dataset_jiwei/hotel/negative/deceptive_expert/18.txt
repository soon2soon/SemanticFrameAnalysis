I love the location of this hotel but that is where the positves end... The hotel is located in downtown Ithaca; close to shopping, great restaurants, bars. Perfect for the night life. However, the staff is rude and unorganized. The room is dirty and unexciting. I had to wait a long time to check in as there was a long line and only two front desk agents. They did not apologize for my wait and made me feel very unwelcome. I reported the issues in the room before I went to dinner and none of them were ever addressed. I was so disapointed with my stay and noticed a few other hotels in or near downtown Ithaca and will look into those for a future stay.
