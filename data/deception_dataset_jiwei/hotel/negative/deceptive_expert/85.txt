My family and I stayed at the French Quarter inn for  weekend this summer and we ended up having quite a few problems. We were placed in a room facing the parking garage; when we attempted to get our room moved  we were told that the hotel was sold out. The concierge at the time recommended a restaurant that was all the way on the other side of town and while nice, we should have been informed that we needed to wear something nicer as we felt uncomfortable the entire dinner. The decor and room were fine but for the price the hotel needs to fine tune their customer service.
