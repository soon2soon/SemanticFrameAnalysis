Upon entering the hotel I had to wait at the front desk for several minutes as the agent was answering many phone calls. It was a busy evening and she seemed to be the only one at the desk. There should certainly be several peaople servicing guests on a night with high demand. The first impression is the most important and this totally set me off on the wrong foot. This was a business trip and I was in a hurry, I would have appreciated a prompt check in. I was hoping that the room and hotel facilities would better my mood but this was not the case. It was a very basic room with out any special touches. The internet access was weak and could not check my email which was a huge disapointment as I had work to tend to. I hope my comments are read and the problems are addressed. However, I will probably bot return.
