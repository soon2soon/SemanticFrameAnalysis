I cannot believe how disorganized this hotel is, my reservation was LOST. I saved my confirmation email and then they were able to find my reservation. Then the rate did not match my confirmation, I was thankful that I saved this email. It took me about 20 minutes to check in and this was not the way I wanted to start off my vacation! The room was ok, nothing to "write home" about and there was a lot of dust. The location is great, close to a lot of shops and restaurants but the service was a mess. I would not spend $200 there again for a night. There is better valie for your money in Ithaca.
