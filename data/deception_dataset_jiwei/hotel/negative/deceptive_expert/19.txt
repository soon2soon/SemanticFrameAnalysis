The parking situation at this hotel is aweful! You have to park in a garage that is a ten minute walk away and it is unsafe in there. My car got damaged! And when I left an article of clothing there, they told me that it was never found. I know I left it and I am it is disapointing that they have dishonest staff. The room could certainly use an update, as well as the internet. The staff was ok but a bit more friendliness wouldn't hurt. The restaurant is ok, but there are many better option close-by on the commons. I hope my concerns are addressed as I am sure I'm not the only ones who experienced these issues.
