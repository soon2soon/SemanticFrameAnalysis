The Mercer Hotel sadly did not live up to my expectations. We usually stay uptown but wanted to try something new for this stay as we wanted to do a lot of eating at downtown restaurants, we love NYC restaurants! The location was just right but that was about the only thing that was right about The Mercer. Jean Georges is the name behind their "Mercer Kitchen" so we were excited about this aspect of the hotel as well as we have enjoyed his other restaurants in the past. We asked the concierge to make us a reservation for two on the third evening of our stay (so it wasn't even a same or next day reservation) and they told us that we could not get a reservation. So I can't even eat at the hotel I am staying at?! We explained that we were very excited to eat at Mercer Kitchen and it is part of why we stayed at the property, if there were not tables for hotel guests that is something that they should say at time of booking or at least offer to make a reservation. Then the Front Desk proceeded to tell us that room service is available 24/7....seriously? We ended up walking around and finding a nice meal on our own with little help of the hotel. When we did get room service it was cold, uninteresting  and slow. SO, if you are a foodie don't waste your time at The Mercer.
