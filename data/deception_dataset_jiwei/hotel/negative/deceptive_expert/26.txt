My stay at The Mercer was just okay, I would stay. For the prices we were charged, I thought that the staff was not very warm, the rooms were too small, and I thought that breakfast should have been included. Room service took way too long to arrive, and when I had arrived at the hotel the day earlier, although my room was not ready, no one offered to take my bags or make me comfortable while I waited. It was a disappointing experience all around. This stay will be my last.
