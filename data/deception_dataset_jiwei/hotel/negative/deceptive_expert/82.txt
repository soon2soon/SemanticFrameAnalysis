Although the hotel is centrally located in the historic district not worth the stay at this establishment.  While staying at this hotel we were very disappointed with the poor attitude of the staff.  From the valet to the front desk at check-in were not given a warm welcome.  I expected southern hospitality and instead received southern hostility.  Don't bother calling the front desk they never answer the phone.  The only person that was nice to us was our housekeeper.  The room was only OK.  For the price I was paying I expected a more luxurious room.  The concierge couldn't answer any of my questions and kept trying to push us towards only one tour company and one restaurant.
