I have never been treated so badly at a hotel.  I usually don't comment on these sites, but I had to share what a terrible stay I had here.  First location is not great-in the middle of a traffic congested parking lot and Target.  It was a pain to get my car and get in and out of the area.  No one showed the basics of customer service or looked at all that they enjoyed their job.  I felt like a number and everything was so robotic and not personallized.  Finally, I was personally insulted by a front desk agent that implyed that I did not pay for something I did not consume.
