The Lowe's in Nashville, is an ok place to stay if you use to staying at a best western. The little cafe was not the greatest. Would recomment you walking across the street if your hungry. The staff seemed very unorganized and undertrained. Concierge was somewhat knowledgable of the area. Should have done my own reshearch before staying in Nashville.
