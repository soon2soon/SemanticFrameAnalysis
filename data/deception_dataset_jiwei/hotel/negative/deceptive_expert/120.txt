Nice rooms but poor housekeeping. I first noticed long stretched hairs on the marble floor. The hairs were apparently stretched as a result of a mopping action. After using the shower, I noticed a rather obnoxious message written on the bathroom mirror which was only visible when steam filled the room. Made me question cleanliness of everything else after that.
