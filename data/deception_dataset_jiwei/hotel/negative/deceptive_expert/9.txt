I am a HHonors member and redeemed some of my accrued points for a rewards stay at The Hilton Garden in a couple of weeks ago. However, when I arrived, I was told that due to occupancy levels, this could not be permitted, even though I had a rewards stay confirmation letter. I ended up paying an absurd room rate that I would not have booked had I known I was going to have to pay that rate, however, at that time there were no other hotel rooms available in the area. I'm not sure if this a HHonors problem or a hotel specific ineptitude issue, but I was upset that no discount or recovery in the very least of ways was even offered to make up for a mistake that was clearly not my fault.
