After having stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong, I would have expected so much more...I asked to be taken to my offices in the hotel car and was offer a Mini-Cooper!
I had wanted to entertain a client at the rooftop bar, which was closed for an event and suggested the lobby bar. When I arrived, there were no seats to be found and the Manager was less than accommodating!
