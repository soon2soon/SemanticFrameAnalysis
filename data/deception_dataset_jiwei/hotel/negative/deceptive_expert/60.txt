For the price, this hotel is overrated!  The rooms are boring, like a typical Hampton Inn at best and the amenities are lacking.  To be honest, you would probably be happier at a Hampton Inn paying a lower rate and getting nice amenities like free breakfast!  This hotel really offered no value and while the staff was nice, I wouldn't say they were particularly polished or professional.  Most times I walked by the desk, they were chatting with one another and didn't even notice me.
