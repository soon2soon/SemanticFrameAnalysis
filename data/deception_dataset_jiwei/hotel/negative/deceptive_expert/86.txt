Stay as far away from this hotel as you can! I booked a last minute deal online and thought I would be getting bargain! What a disappointment. Upon arrival I had to wait at least 10 minutes until a bellman appeared, and then had to wait another 30 minutes until my luggage arrived. Walking past the front desk, do not expect a smile or friendly greeting, all you will receive is a bored look if they even glance up from their computer. I wrote a complaint on the response card provided in the room but have not received a follow back from management. Very disappointed.
