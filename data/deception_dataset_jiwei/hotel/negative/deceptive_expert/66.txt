If you are a NYC traveler who relies on room service throughout your stay, do not stay here! When I come to New York I am traveling for business and on the go, therefore normally have my meals in the room. Considering the hotel's reputation, you would this that they would figure this out by now. There was something wrong with every order I made, whether it was wrong, cold, or late. For a traveler such as myself this is an important aspect and says a lot about the back of house organization. Also, not having a gym on property is a bit of a let down, although Equinox is a nice gym I really do not want to fight the crowds, (at peak hours it is very likely that you will have to wait for a treadmill)  having a gym on property would really up the value of this property. I am currently looking for a new go-to in NYC, it is just not the place for a business traveler.
