Apparently the  front desk person had just started working the day we arrived.  We waited behind four other people to check-in.   Who would have thought it could take 45 minutes just to check-in to a small hotel.   She seemed frazzled and confused.  From the cheesy shops to the overpriced restaurant we were not impressed with this hotel.  The wait staff was snooty and it took thirty minutes to receive our over priced drink order.  The food was OK but nothing special.  Everytime we left the hotel we would see employees standing outside smoking.  I definitely would not recommend this hotel.
