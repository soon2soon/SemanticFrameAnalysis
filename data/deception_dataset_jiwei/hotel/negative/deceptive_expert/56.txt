During our recent stay at the Renaissance, we were highly disappointed with the facility of the pool.  We were with our young children who love to swim and we specificially stayed here because they offer an indoor pool.  What isn't so clear when booking the hotel is that the pool is actually located in the Gold's Gym next door to the hotel and that it was under maintenance for our stay.  This was a huge disappointment for our children and for us as this was an activity we had planned on doing.  Unfortunately there was no alternative so we had to make do with the shopping and entertainment options in the North Hills area which ended up being fine.  I think the hotel needs to communicate better about its facilities.
