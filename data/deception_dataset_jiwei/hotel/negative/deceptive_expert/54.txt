I frequently travel to the area for business and thought I would try staying at the Renaissance this time around.  The hotel was a bit impersonal, I felt a bit like an average joe checking in a getting my key card, which for the price I paid, was a bit unnerving.  I didn't feel like the price was justified and it seemed more like I was paying for the expensive real estate in the snazzy shopping plaza it was located in.  I would consider staying again because it was convenient for my meetings, however I hope they do some customer service training with their staff!
