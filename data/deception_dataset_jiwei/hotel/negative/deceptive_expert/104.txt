I stay at many hotels around the world and have always had good experience with St. Regis.  I was excited to try this new resort and go shopping at the Bal Harbour.  I was surprised at how bad this resort was. The employees are obviously all new and don't know what they are doing. Concierge sent us to the worst restaurant and we had to take a 20 min cab ride to get there.
