As one of the more expensive hotels in the Ithaca area, I was disappointed with the overall experience of my recent stay. We came to visit the Ithaca College and Cornell campuses and when we discussed this at check-in, we were not assisted with any college or area specific information that may have proved helpful for our visit. This may be expecting too much, but a simple area map or suggestions on where to eat on either campus would have been great tips to enhance our visit.
