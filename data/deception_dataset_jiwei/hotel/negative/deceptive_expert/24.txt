The hotel itself was okay, but there was so much noise coming from the street at night, that it made the cost of the hotel not make any sense. We complained but were met with no solution other than earplugs. The staff just didn't seem to care about our experience. Plus, the lighting in the rooms was so dark and dim. We had high expectations, and they were, unfortunately, not met.
