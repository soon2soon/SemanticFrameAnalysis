Worst stay in Charleston!!!  Being frequent travelers to Charleston we decided to try the French Quarter Inn.  What a disappointment.  The rooms were small and dirty.  Champagne was flat and cheap.  Cookies in the evening were stale.  Coffee was cold and weak.  Breakfast was the same every morning.  We saw staff wiping off tables with dirty rags, not washing their hands and then handling breakfast items without using tongs.  We never at anything at this hotel again after viewing such unsanitary behavior.
