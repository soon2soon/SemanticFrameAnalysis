Although the rooms were spacious we had a view of a brick wall.  Maybe that is why we could never receive the WIFI signal.  Our in room safe didn't work and there was nobody working in maintenance to fix the safe.  When we made the reservation it was explained that I am highly allergic to feathers.  There were feather pillows in the room.  The room smelled like cigarette smoke.  We were told there were no other rooms available and they couldn't move us.  My trip was spent at the ER with a severe migraine from the down pillows and cigarette smoke.
