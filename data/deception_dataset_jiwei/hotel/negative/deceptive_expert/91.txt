I am a meeting planner and arrived early before my group this past week. I was shocked to find that even though I had booked over 20 rooms with this hotel, I was not going to have any type of customer service during my stay. We were a late check in but we had online confirmations for a luxury king room. What we ended up with was two queen beds in a room next to the elevator. When I addressed my concerns I was given no apology. The only explanation was that they were full and were unable to move us. My wife and I were forced to sleep in separate beds despite being married for 10 years. Next, when we tried to watch television the channels were fuzzy. I did not even attempt to contact the front desk due to the poor service provided at check in. When my group arrived the next day check in took forever. I would have thought a hotel of this caliber would be equipped to handle a normal group check in. We will look elsewhere the next time Charleston is on our business agenda.
