It took FOREVER to find this hotel. With all the confusing intersections and one-way roads in Ithaca, I thought we would never find the place. Once we arrived and realized we had to park so far away it really disapointed us! The front desk seemed to have non-stop phones ringing (they should have an operator!). I prefer to stay at a hotel that is easy to find with convenient parking. You could even hear the traffic from the room! The restaurant was nice and had good options but there are other places bear by that we chose to try. I am not sure if we will return, I am sure there is a more convenient place to stay in Ithaca.
