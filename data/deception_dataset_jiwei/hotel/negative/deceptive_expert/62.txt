The reason for my low rating is because the price you pay does not equal what you get.  There are plenty of other lower priced options that you'd get so much more for.  This hotel thinks it is luxury but it is really just faking it.  They offer almost nothing in regards to amenities, they even charge for internet!  I'm used to staying in hotels that care about their customers and want to promote loyalty, but I just didn't find a good reason to want to come back to this hotel brand.  Next time I will stay somewhere without the fancy facade for half the price and get more!
