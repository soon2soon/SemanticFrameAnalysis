 Came to Peninsula with friends to celebrate New Year, the lounge was full so we were directed to other side, next to restaurant to see the maitre 'd who was a female. She told us just to take any seat. We sat for 20 minutes next to a tray of dirty dishes near the bar because they obviously were overstaffed. A prosecco with a Campari drop for color is the same price this year as a champagne + Campari drop, $35 per glass. When we asked, our waiter told us "Here, our prosecco and champagne cost the same." We were shocked. Upon leaving, I did my ritual of asking the doorman in which direction the closest subway is because, even though I'm a local, I always like to see the type of customer service I get w/a response. He told me "you can check your smartphone or go inside and ask the Concierge because I have no idea." I wouldn't stay here again--or spend a single dollar on a drink--when Penninsula NYC hires staff like this, at the holidays or at any time of theyear.
