DO NOT STAY HERE!  I was here on business and have never been treated so poorly.  Rooms were new, but not well kelp with stains and scuffed furniture.  Housekeeping service was not complete with leaving trash under the bed.  No one seemed happy to work there.  When traveling as much as I do I want to see happy people.
