I was particularly disappointed with the interactions of the reception staff, from a cold welcome at check-in to when I asked if they had valet parking they responded rudely that they did not and did not tell me the alternative. As a HHonors Gold member who travels on business frequently, I was more than disappointed by the performance of the staff at this property, as I know the Hilton brand expects and serves at better standards.
