I choose this hotel due to its proximity to my meetings that I had while I was in town.  The locationw as definitely good for that purpose, but that's about it!  The hotel is located in a shopping center that is a bear to get in and out of since it is the holiday season.  I literally had to wait at crowded intersections that were jammed just to get into the shopping plaza and then wait for pedestrians, etc.  Don't get me wrong, the setting is quaint, but not when you are busy and trying to get in and out and back to your room quickly.
