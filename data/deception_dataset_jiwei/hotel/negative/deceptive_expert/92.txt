My girlfriends and I decided to splurge on a summer getaway and chose the French Quarter Inn. Needless to say, we were not impressed. we found mold on the ceiling vents of our room which created a horrible odor. When we called down to complain, they offered to switch us to a higher level room, but we would be responsible for the additional room charge. Unbelievable!
