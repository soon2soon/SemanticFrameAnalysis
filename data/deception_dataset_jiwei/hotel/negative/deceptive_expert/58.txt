Honestly, it seems like everything went wrong for my wife and I at our recent stay at the Renaissance.  It started when we arrived and the front desk manager informed us that they were sold out of king beds and ended with a billing issue that took 15 minutes to sort out.  We weren't in the hotel very much during our stay and I'm glad we weren't because there was little character to the place and we preferred walking around the quaint North Hills shopping area more than staying in our room overlooking a highway.  Next time we come to Raleigh I will definitely be staying somewhere else!
