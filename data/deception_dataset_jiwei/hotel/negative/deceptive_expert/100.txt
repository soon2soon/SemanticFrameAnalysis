We only stayed one night at this hotel but we were not sorry to leave.  The welcome by the bellman and reception staff was basic and not friendly.  The concierge made every effort to be helpful and was the most friendly of the staff.  The "free" breakfast was very basic, the only alternative seemed to be room service where prices were not cheap. This cost was boosted by a 20% service charge. The A/C broke and the shower leaked.  There was hair the the sink drain.
