From all the previous reviews I had read, I thought this hotel was going to be flawless. Unfortunately, it does not live up to its luxury hotel sales tag. I could not get the air conditioner to work properly, front desk staff was not overly eager to help, and it did not seem like the concierge knew very much about the city. Would not recommend anyone to stay here.
