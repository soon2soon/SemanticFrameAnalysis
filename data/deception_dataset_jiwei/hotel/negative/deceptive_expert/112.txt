We received a wonderful welcome email after booking our reservation and indicated that we would require transportation arranged from MIA. The concierge was helpful but could have done better. Our flight arrived about 35 minutes early from Zurich and I did not expect to wait because it was St. Regis. When we eventually informed the concierge, they told us that it was handled by an outside company and acted like we were bothering them. Bad start to an otherwise ok stay.
