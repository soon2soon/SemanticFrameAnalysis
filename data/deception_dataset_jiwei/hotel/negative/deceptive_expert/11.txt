This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in! From the moment we pulled up to the hotel we were immediately unimpressed. It is located near busy, one-way, confusing streets and the traffic could be heard from the room. The front desk staff was unfriendly and were unwilling to fulfill basic requests (room away from elevator and on a high floor). We were so upset with the hotel that we chose not to dine on property, to avoid further let-down. We will not be returning to the Hilton Garden Inn and would highly recommend others not to as well.
