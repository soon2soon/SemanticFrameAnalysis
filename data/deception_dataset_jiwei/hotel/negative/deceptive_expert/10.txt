For what you will pay here, being one of the more expensive options in the Ithaca area, the hotel is rundown and needs a renovation. The sheets and amenities were ratty and outdated. The TV's basic channel options were underwhelming, and the wifi was some of the slowest I have ever seen, not even worth using it. To top it all off, I was placed in a non-smoking room that someone had clearly smoked in, but there were only "smoking" rooms available for me to move to, so I put up with it.
