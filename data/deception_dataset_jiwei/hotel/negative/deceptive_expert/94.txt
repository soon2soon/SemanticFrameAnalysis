Website was very difficult to navigate and when I tried to make reservation it kept giving me an error message. Called to make reservation over the phone and had to listen to a lot of hotel descriptions and up selling when all I wanted to do was make a quick reservation online. Really gave the hotel a bad first impression. Check in was fine but had to wait 30 minutes to get our luggage; we were almost late to our dinner reservations because of this. We were not informed that our credit card was going to have a pending charge on our account that remained for a week after our stay. Was very disappointed and we will not be returning.
