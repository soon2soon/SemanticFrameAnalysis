One of the male front desk agents, I believe his name was Mark?, was quite possibly the rudest staff member I have ever encountered at a hotel in my many travels. When we asked for restaurant recommendations, he simply pointed to the door and told us to walk outside... later that night, we asked for a wakeup call and he said there was an alarm clock in our room... and even still, when we asked for a late checkout the next day, he refused, saying that if we left at any point after the 12:00pm checkout time, there would be an automatic $50 late departure charge billed to us, ridiculous!!
