I checked in to the Mercer Hotel very excited for a weekend of shopping and downtown dining with my sister. After a long redeye flight we were excited to take a nap before our day began. We booked the evening before so we could check in for our 7:30 am arrival that day. Two days before arrival I had called the reservationist to make sure this was all set. When we arrived they claimed to have no record of this and because we did not show up the evening before, they took a last minute booking and our room was not ready until 2 pm. They were extremely apologetic but this was very frusturating as I double checked this with their reservationist, maybe she just did not care enough to write it down? The Jean Georges restaurant in the hotel was good, not my favorite of his though...I prefer the J&G Grill. Otherwise, good location and slept well once we got into our room.
