We wanted a bit of R&R on our recent overnight in Raleigh and had heard alot about the Renaissance and decided to give it a try!  We were very unimpressed and don't get what all the buzz is about.  The staff was friendly, but they didn't do anything to wow me and my husband.  I guess we thought there was going to be something more special about the place but we just didn't see it.  Also, the shopping center it is located in is charming but BUSY.  We felt like we didn't really get away because we were bombarded with shoppers, traffic, stores, lights and it really wasn't a relaxing environment.  I'll come back to this hotel when I have a to do list I'm trying to accomplish!
