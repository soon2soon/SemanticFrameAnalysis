Great location, but that's all!  The rooms are too small for the price we paid for, the staff are not friendly and not helpful.  They ignored us after we checked in most of the times.  We stayed there for 6 nights and felt like they don't care.  They did not changed our sheets until the third night.  This should be an option for us not a mandatory.  We did not get  a discount on our rates for not changing our bed sheets every night.  We had to pay for internet connection, it should be included in our rates.   I suggest for you to stay in another hotel that cares!
