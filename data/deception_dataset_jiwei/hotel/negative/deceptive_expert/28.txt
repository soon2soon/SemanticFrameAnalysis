I was a recent guest at The Peninsula New York and ended up waiting over 20 minutes to check-in, to then be told my accommodations were not available until after 3pm. I sat in the lounge area, where I waited, yet again, for a server to greet me and take my order. I was not provided with any extraordinary levels of service one would expect. When I finally did check in, I walked into a small, somber room, which was a true disappointment. My luggage had not been sent up by this time and I had to wait an hour for the Bellmen to show up.
