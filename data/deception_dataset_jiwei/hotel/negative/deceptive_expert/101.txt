The hotel is beautiful and the location is great - Across the street from the Bal Harbour Mall. The service however is horrible. 

We stayed in a junior suite and were expecting butler service. This was not provided till we inquired about it after our first night. The butler eventually assigned to us was a "fill-in" who did know have a clue about butler style service. Discreet was certainly not his style and we felt our privacy was invaded. When we eventually told the manager about our concerns, there was nothing done. When shifts changed and other butlers came on, they all seemed to be very chatty and interested in our business than in allowing us to enjoy our extended weekend.
