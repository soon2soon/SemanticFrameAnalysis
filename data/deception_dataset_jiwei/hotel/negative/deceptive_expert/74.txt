The worst hotel....I have been treated better at a Motel 6!  Other people must notice this because the place was empty the whole time I was there.  No one in the lobby or restaurant.  No one would even say hello to me when I walked in and the staff were never paying attention and only talking in groups.  There are shops and restaurants in the mall complex, but it is not worth the price to stay at this hotel
