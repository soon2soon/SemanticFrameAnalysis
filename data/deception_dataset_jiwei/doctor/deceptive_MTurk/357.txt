Dr. Healley has been my families primary care physician for many years. Caring for all 5 members of our family Dr. Healley and his staff have become like family. We never have to wait very long at our appointments. His office is always clean, warm, and comfortable. Dr. Healley is always up beat and friendly and conservative with his prescription writing. He's been a wonderful doctor for my family for many years and will continue to be so for many to come.
