I have been a very loyal and satisfied patient of Dr. Benoit LeBlanc for about five years now. I was referred to Dr. LeBlanc by a close friend, and initially met with him to discuss a breast augmentation surgery. I was immediately impressed with his professionalism and the care he took to ensure my comfort. After my surgery, I was very pleased with the results. I had minimal scarring, and I healed very quickly. Two years ago, Dr. LeBlanc performed liposuction and a tummy tuck, and I was again amazed at the results. He has a wonderful bedside manner, and truly takes the time to talk to his patients and get to know them. In the operating room, he has a natural talent, and his work is superb. I have almost no scarring, and the bruising/discomfort after both of my procedures was nothing like what I anticipated. In the future, should I ever decide to have more work done, there is no other surgeon I would trust with my body than Dr. LeBlanc. He is, in my opinion, one of the best cosmetic surgeons in the country.
