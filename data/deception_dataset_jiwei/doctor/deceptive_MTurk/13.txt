It's nice to know there are people out there you can still rely on. I have a very busy work schedule and only had a small window to come in. I told them I was really strapped for time and they were still able to fit me in. Dr. Whelan took the time to get to know me on a personal level. Then explained everything to me clearly, laid out the steps that I needed to take, and answered all my questions. It's nice to know that I am more then just another patient to Dr. Whelan.
