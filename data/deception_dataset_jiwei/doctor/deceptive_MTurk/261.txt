Dr. Bechbache was great. I went in because I had a chest cold. It turned out that I had an upper respiratory infection. Dr Bechbache was able to easily diagnose and get me the proper medication. The doctor was friendly and warm. Didn't make me feel stupid, but was really glad I came in. So was I. I would definitely reccomend the doctor to anyone and everyone in the area.
