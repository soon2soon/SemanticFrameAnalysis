I made an appointment with Dr. Taranow at the suggestion of my orthopedist. I had very large breasts - 32DDD - and I had quite a great deal of pain in my back and shoulders, and recurrent numbness in my arms. After years of ortopedic and chiroprctic treatment, my orthopedist finally suggested that my large breasts might be the problem, and he referred me to Dr. Taranow. At my first appointment, I was embarrassed, but Dr. Taranow made me feel comfortable and the exam was not nearly as awkward as I expected it to be. Dr. Taranow concurred with my orthopedist that my breasts were causing my pain and numbness, and we decided on an "after" size, and scheduled an appointment for the surgery two weeks later. I am now a couple of months post surgery and I could not be happier. I came home the day after surgery, and my recovery was fairly uneventful. All of the stitches were internal and dissolvable so I didn't have to go back to have stitches removed, but Dr. Taranow did ask me to come back a couple of times so he could check on my progress. The scars are healing nicely, and are mostly hidden, and I am loving my new 32C breasts. The back and shoulder pain and the numbness are gone, and now I can wear the cute little tops that I never could wear before. I think Dr. Taranow did an amazing job with my surgery, and I cannot recommend him highly enough.
