Mr Richard Davis is everything that modern doctors lack. His bedside manner is top notch. He took the time to explain all of my options to me in a way I couldn't understand. I got the impression he was talking to me,not at me,as some medical professionals do. He was very warm and kind after the procedure. He fully explained to me what was going to happen during and after the surgery,and made sure i was 100% comfortable and ready for the next stage. Mr Davis also called the next morning to make sure I was not experiencing anything out of the ordinary,and told me to call his office if anything changed with my recovery. During my follow up visit,he was very patient with my questions and concerns. He made me feel that if there was every a problem or issue,that his office was available to me. I also got a postcard in the mail a week after thanking me for my business,along with a nice card. I would recommend Dr Davis to anyone else looking for a quality doctor that will take his time to make sure your comfortable with the process from begining to end.
