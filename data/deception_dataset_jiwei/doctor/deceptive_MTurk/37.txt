I simply do not have enough good things to say about Dr. Howley. He completely changed how I few myself when he gave me my new nose. I am no longer embarrassed by the huge beak I used to have, instead I have the perfect nose to fit my face. Everyone that he works with are extremely nice and professional and I never once had any misgivings about him. I met with a few other surgeons before my operation, and none of them were as nice or as helpful as Dr. Brent Howley.
