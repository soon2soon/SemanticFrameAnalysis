I first learned of Dr. Backstein when I read his article about the pros and cons of liposuction. My first phone call to schedule my initial consultation was met by an understanding receptionist who immediately booked my appointment. At my first consultation with Dr. Backstein, he spent almost two hours with me going over my chart and my liposuction options including the overall risks and what he thought was the preferred choice of liposuction for me. He also spent time going over the prices, which was an important factor to me. Overall, my first impression of Dr. Backstein was very good. I came away informed of the risks, but felt comfortable that I was making the right choice of cosmetic surgeon. Dr. Backstein also met with me pre-operation to go over all of my questions and answered them fully. I was prepared for the procedure and knew I was in good hands. After the surgery and recovery was completed, Dr. Backstein visited with me to make sure that I was satisfied and followed up with me three months later to check on my status. Of course, the surgery was a success and I'm looking forward to every day now. Thank you Dr. Backstein!
