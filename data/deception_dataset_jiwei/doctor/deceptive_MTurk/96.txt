After going through a series of health related issues,And getting no help. The people at South Calgary Primary Care Network were able to find the problem and and get me results. Their staff was very pleasant and helped with every aspect . They were also really helpful with the insurance process. Now I'm back on my feet and healthy . Thanks South Calgary Primary care !!
