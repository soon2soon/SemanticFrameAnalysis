Since 2005 I have been looking for a medical treatment/checkup facility with both the welcomeness of a family doctor & the professionalism of a respected private practice. This is when I found the Family Health Teams in Ontario. Upon arrival at the facility, I was immediately impressed by the overall knowledge by all staff. I met my doctor, Francois Viviers on my first visit when I had a broken a bone in my foot during a home softball game & he has been my go-to doctor ever since. Francois is a very caring & gentle medical professional. He is very knowledgeable, but does not complicate the visit by any medical jargon & is very straight & to the point in many cases. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a professional & clean facility for family & singles alike.
