I visited Dr. Rafik Bechbache office on referal from a friend. I found the building to kept quite nicely and the office staff was very friendly and helpful with my insurance information. When the nurse came to get me she was quite pleasant and took my blood pressure with a bit of concern and said she would let the Dr, know it was a bit high. I did find the room a bit chilly but I didn't have to wait long to see the Doctor. When he arrived he aske me how I was and what I was being seen for and I gave him a brief description and background. We made some small talk about fishing and so forth and he asked my family background. I found this visit quite helpful and will be changing my family over to his practice. Thanks!!!
