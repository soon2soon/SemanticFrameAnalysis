Dr. Macadam and her support staff were courteous and very knowledgeable about the cosmetic surgery I was considering. They very clearly outlined the pros and cons of the reconstruction procedure. They took the time to answer all of my questions regarding the procedure and, most important to me, the after care required when the surgery was completed. I highly recommend Dr. Macadam for any type of cosmetic or reconstructive surgery you may be considering.
