We just wanted to thank the staff of SickKids for all of their wonderful support throughout our stay with them. Although this was a very stressful time for us, everyone at SickKids treated us so well and were very helpful in answering all of our questions and concerns. We are so thankful to Dr. Christopher Forrest and his assistants! They really took the time to explain everything with the procedure and provided the reassurance we needed during this time. All of our accomodations and the excellent support from the staff members made our experience so much easier and we were able to provide our son with the family support he needed. I can't thank you enough for everything that you have done for us! We highly recommend SickKids to any parent who may be considering having their child's procedure here; the staff is extremely helpful and supportive.
