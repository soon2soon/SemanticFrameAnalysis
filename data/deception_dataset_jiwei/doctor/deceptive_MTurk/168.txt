Not only a doctor but a friend! One may think that going to the doctor is a pain, and not something to look forward to, but with Dr. Kriegler I get wonderful service and she treats you like a friend, we can talk easily and openly. It is the most comfortable clinic environment I have seen in a while. Dr. Kriegler is very understanding and intelligent about my medical conditions and questions and just knows the best thing to do. When I call in when she is not available, she gets back to me ASAP, and I can also just expect the best from her.
