I visited Dr. Albak a few weeks ago when I was experiencing severe pain in my back. The office is always very accommodating to me, and I did not want to have to visit the ER. The wait time was not long, and the nurse continually checked on me, I felt even though I was a walk in, that I was a priority for them. When I spoke to Dr. Albak, he told me that he was 98% sure that the symptoms I was describing were related to a kidney stone. He was undoubtedly right! After all the proper tests and scans I indeed had a kidney stone @ the age of 25! With all of his experience I trust Dr. Albak to guide me in the right direction in preventing the re-occurrence of kidney stones in the future.
