I needed to see Dr. LeBlanc for some medical issues I had been having. I phoned the clinic the schedule one in, and the office staff were professional and knowledgable. I was able to get an appointment within the week. When I arrived for my appointment, the staff was again professional and friendly, and the nurse came to get me quickly so I didn't have to wait long. Dr. LeBlanc came into the room within five minutes, listened to my concerns and addressed each concern thoroughly. He also asked several questions and recommened a medication-in which he called in to the pharmacy right away. I appreciated that I was able to see the doctor, and not some PA in his place. After all, I pay for a DOCTOR appointment, not a PA. It's been one week since my appointment and I am feeling great!
