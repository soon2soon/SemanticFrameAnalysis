I saw Dr. Hunter in December of last year for a case of Pnuemonia, she did a wonderful job of listening to me explain to her that I always get Pnuemonia every year and she suggested that I get the Pnuemonia shot to keep this from reoccurring. She has been the first doctor to really listen to me, and answered my questions with no problems, she really took her time with me. She's been a great doctor for me. Highly recommend!
