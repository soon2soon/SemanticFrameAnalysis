Dr. Richards is fantastic. He was both pleasant and very professional. I felt like he truly listened to what I wanted as well as any questions and concerns I had. Admittedly, I was quite nervice for the procedure but Dr. Richards team made the extra effort to make me feel comfortable and calm. All and all, if I ever need or want cosmetic surgery again, I will definitely be going back to Dr. Richards.
