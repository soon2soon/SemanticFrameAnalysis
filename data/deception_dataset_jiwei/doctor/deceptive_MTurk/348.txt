I went to see Dr. Jaarsveldt as a new patient. I had a really bad cold, so I called and was scheduled an appointment for the following morning. I arrived at ontime and was recieved by a very friendly front desk secretary. She gave me a form to fill out, and I was seen by the doctor on time, only waiting for a few minutes. Dr. Jaarsveldt listened to my symptoms and showed concern. He really cared about my needs. I would recommend any of my friends and family to his practice. He is a great doctor, and has a very clean facility. The practice has convenient office hours and it also accepts a variety of payments.
