Several months ago I was in search of a Doctor to tell me why I had several spots on my skin. I was recommended to Doctor Johann Kriegler by a friend. I made a Doctor's appointment to see Dr. Kriegler on the next available date that I could be seen. My visit to his office was very cordial. He showed compassion to me by being engage through the entire visit. He is a professional and is excellent at his job. He recommended a treatment for my spots and over the period time I applied what He recommended and whatever was trying to takeover my skin went away. I recommend you visit Mediclinic Family Medicine and Urgent Care,101-3333-8th Street East,Saskatoon, Sask.S7H 4K1.
