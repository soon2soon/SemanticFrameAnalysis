I went to see Dr. Albak for the first time today after researching their website. I was checked in promptly and taken back to an exam room within just a few minutes where my vital signs were taken. After a short wait, the Dr. came in, washed his hands, shook my hand and welcomed me to their practice. He listened attentively while I described my symptoms while taking notes on his laptop. He asked me a few questions then examined me and discussed treatment in laymen's terms I could understand. I was very impressed with Dr. Albak's courtesty and professionalism, and believe I have finally found a doctor who really cares about my health. There is a LOT of information on their website, including contact numbers, hours, and all of the services their clinic offers. Two thumbs up...I highly recommend Dr. Albak!
