Dr. Cynthia Nave is one of the best doctors I have been to for my botox injections. Other doctors are too rough and do not take time to get to know their patients. Dr. Nave always takes the time during each appointment to ask you about yourself, and what brought you to her office. She also takes the time to learn something about your personal life, in order to ensure that she is providing you with all of the services that you need or didn't realize you needed. I will definitely be returning to Dr. Nave's office in the future, and I will definitely recommend her as well as her practice to all of my friends!
