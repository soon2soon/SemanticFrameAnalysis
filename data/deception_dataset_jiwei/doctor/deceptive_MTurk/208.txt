Dr. Ali is my favorite doctor of all time. I had felt that I'd never get the care that I wanted or felt I deserved until I went to her. She listens very carefully and actually takes all of your symptoms and/or concerns into consideration instead of just focusing on one thing and not treating the other conditions or looking into other possibilities. It's refreshing to find a medical professional who actually cares. Finally, someone who truly knows what health CARE is. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for more personalized attention.
