I am beyond satisfied with the results from my surgery. I sought out Dr. Macadam in hope of getting a tummy tuck. I had recently lost a lot of weight and had annoying flabby skin around my stomach that I could NOT get rid of no matter what I did. She walked me though the procedure. I was taken care of quickly. The healing process was fast and my scarring is very minimal. You wouldn't know I had work done unless you really looked at me. I can't thank her enough for that and my new, totally flat stomach!
