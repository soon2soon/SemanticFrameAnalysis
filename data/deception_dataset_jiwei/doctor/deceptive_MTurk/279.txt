I recently saw Dr. Robert Backstein to get cosmetic reconstructive surgery on my nose, as I had recently been in a terrible car accident. Dr. Backstein and his staff were very accommodating and friendly, and were there every step of the way to help me through my surgery and my recovery process. At first I was nervous about getting surgery, but after speaking with Dr. Backstein all of my fears were alleviated. The doctor was very knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions I had in a professional manner. I would recommend this practice to my friends and family anytime. For more information go to the website www.cosmeticsurgerytoronto.com, there you will find contact information for the wonderful staff and I am confident they respond to and questions or concerns promptly.
