Dr. Hasell is a fantastic physician. I went in for a relatively routine procedure and was still very nervous. However, both he and his staff were able to explain to me exactly what they were going to do and there was no need to worry. He and his staff are also very personable, and it is evident that they are truly passionate about their jobs. It was the most comforted I've ever felt at the doctor's office, and the procedure went smoothly. I highly recommend him to anyone needing cosmetic surgery.
