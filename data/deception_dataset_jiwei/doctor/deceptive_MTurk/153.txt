I liked that I was able to see Dr. Ayling the same day. It's comforting to be seen by your own doctor the day you need them. I was having pain in my stomach and wasn't sure what to do. Dr. Ayling was so good with me and I felt that he was really listening to me. He never jumped in to try to talk over me - I hate that. The examination was thorough but quick. Then he had several ideas on how I could feel better. I really appreciated that he did not just tell me it would just go away or just give me a pill. We discussed the method I felt most comfortable with and then he explained what to do if that wasn't enough. He was great and told me what to do if I needed more urgent help during off-clinic hours. When I left Dr. Ayling's clinic, I felt relieved and like I had a plan. Thank you so much Dr. Ayling!
