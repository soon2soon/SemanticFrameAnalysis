I had been considering botox treatment for a while. A friend recommended Dr. Keller at The Baywood Clinic and I couldn't be happier with my experience! Dr. Keller and the staff were incredibly helpful, courteous and professional. The results were fantastic and the price can't be beat. I would highly recommend Dr. Keller for regular treatments, or just for a special occasion.
