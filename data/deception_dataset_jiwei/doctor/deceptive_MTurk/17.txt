Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a life saver. I just recently moved into a new neighborhood and my daughter came over a cold so we did a quick search on the internet and found Hamilton Family Health Team and were referred to Dr. Whelan. Not only did Dr. Whelan diagnose the problem, she also helped see to it that my little girl was going to get better. We checked in once a week and was always greeted with a smile. I look forward to seeing my two other sons' in the good hands of Dr. Whelan. Her professional atmosphere I would call comforting to all parents to know that she takes the job seriously.
