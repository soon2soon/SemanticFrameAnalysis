Knowing that Dr. Wolf has over 18 years of experience as a plastic surgeon made me feel more at ease about having my deviated septum corrected. During our initial consultation, Dr. Wolf was very patient and seemed to show a genuine interest in all of my concerns, and took the time to thoroughly explain how the surgery would work, how long it would take to recover, possible complications, and other information that I felt was important to know. After the surgery, Dr. Wolf came to see me at the the bedside to follow up with me and see how I'm doing, which was a great gesture that I had not expected. Two months after the surgery, my nose looks good, I can breathe great, and I can honestly say that Dr. Wolf did an outstanding job!
