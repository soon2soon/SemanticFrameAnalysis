During a recent visit to the Family Practice run by Susan Hunter of the St. Joseph's General Hospital, I was genuinely surprised by the staff. They went to great lenghts to ensure me and my child were comfortable during what at the time felt like a scary situation. Everyone took the time to explain what was happening, why and made sure my son was comfortable. Needless to say I think her and her staff are top notch and will not be taking my son anywhere else!
