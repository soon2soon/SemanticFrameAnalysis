Having spent most of my adolescent years completely covered from head to toe regardless of the season, weather or temperature, I am so relieved to finally look in the mirror and see me - and not the ugly scars left behind by acne. Dr. Robinson and the entire office staff have truly given me back a freedom I have not experienced since before I was a teenager. What an amazing feeling to walk out of the house, confident I look my best because I feel my best. No more excruciating hours in the mirror trying to "cover-up". No more shopping for just the right clothing to conceal the acne damage. I can't begin to express how grateful I am for Dr. Robinson's talents. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You have changed my life. I want to share my story with others in hopes that they too can experience the new opportunities your treatment has offered me.
