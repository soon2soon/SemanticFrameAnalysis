I was searching endlessly for a professional and friendly plastic surgeon in order to get a breast lift. I knew the procedure is something to be taken lightly, especially since the muscle surround your breast is coming to be cut into. But Dr. Silverman put my mind at ease. He explained to me the different options in terms of an incision (lollipop, anchor, or areolar) and what he felt would best suit me. Dr. Silverman also provided me information on what to do pre and post surgery, and never once along the way did I feel force to do something I did not want to do. He also does procedures concerning the face and body, so after my breast lift, I would love to go back to him and get the rest of my body done.
