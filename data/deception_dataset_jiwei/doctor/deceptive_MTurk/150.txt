I went to Dr Grants practice because i was experiencing chest pains. I was extremely pleased with how quickly i was able to see the Doctor. The practice while located on third floor was easy to find. Dr Grant was very polite and gentle, he was prompt and quick with his diagnosis. As it turns out i was suffering from a minor condition, none the less the doctor set me at ease. I would recommend the Doctors practice to my friends and family.
