My family and I have been patients of Dr. Albak's for almost ten years at the Assinibone Medical Clinic. He has always been available to us in any emergency situation, and there have been alot with three sons. He spends the time to find out what is wrong, how we are feeling and what we think is a good medical treatment. He is friendly, considerate and professional. His staff is also friendly, considerate and professional. I would recommend him to anyone as your family doctor. The hours the clinic is available is great plus the walk-in hours are excellent. Assinibone Medical Clinic and Dr. Albak can take care of all your medical needs and emergencies. I highly recommend them to anyone needing a healthcare facility and doctor.
