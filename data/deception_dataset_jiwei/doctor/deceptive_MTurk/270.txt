Let me start by saying that I was skeptical about having any kind of "work" done. I was afraid that it would be over the top and noticeable in a negative way, but I couldn't stand the thought of my extremely large nose dominating my wedding photos and the wedding was less than a year away. So, I took my doubts to Dr. Richard Davis after a recommendation by a close friend of mine. Dr. Davis took the time to explain exactly what changes he would make and how my nose would then work with the rest of my facial features instead of standing out. After hearing how reassuring and confident Dr. Davis was I decided to go ahead with the procedure and I'm so glad that I did. Dr. Davis did such an amazing job, I couldn't be happier and my wedding pictures prove it. I'm not one to brag on myself but I looked amazing that day. Dr. Davis didn't just improve my looks, he improved my self-image and my life.
