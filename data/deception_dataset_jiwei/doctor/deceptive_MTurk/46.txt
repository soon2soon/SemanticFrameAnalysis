I went to see Dr. Robinson. First of all making an appointment was simple and I got in within a week of calling. The office was clean, organized and the office staff was very friendly, accomodating and professional. I felt right at home. The new patient paperwork was thorough but not redundant and was easy to navigate through. I had approximately a ten minute wait time before being seen. The nurse was friendly and immediately made me feel comfortable. She had a good sense of humor and was very likeable. I waited approximately 5 minutes between seeing the nurse and the doctor. Dr. Robinson had excellent bedside manner. He explained my options in depth in a language I could easily understand. He took his time to answer my questions thoroughly and didn't pressure me in any way. He was respectful of my wishes and allowed me to choose the course of my treatment. I would definately recommend Dr. Robinson.
