Ted Jablonski brings the phrase, 'More Than Medication,' to a bright light. His practice allows patients to bring forward their individual and specific needs, while he provides his vast knowledge to provide a holistic approach of healing and success. Dr. Jablonski is not your average doctor whom went to school for years for specified qualifications and became a doctor. He works in Nursing Homes while he is also trained in Sexual Health. He continues his education, while educating others throughout Canada. I give my highest acceptance and appreciation for Dr. Ted Jablonski's practice, as I have been given the most quality care and feel that I am actually being cared for while in his presence.
