I came to Dr. Keller at the Baywood clinic for laser hair removal on my body. As I am Asian, my underarms and other parts of my body look terrible with normal hair growth. I was extremely embarrassed by my dark underarms and was shamed to wear tank tops when I was visited my family back in Thailand as their is such pressure to maintain flawless skin. I decided it was time to remove my underarm hair forever as I had a wedding back in Thailand coming up and I wanted to feel confident in the photos. Having reviewed Dr. Keller's credentials and the fact he is an Examiner for the American Board of Laser medicine, I felt at ease, even if this is just a minor procedure. I can say that during all treatments he was extremely professional, timely and the cost was competitive for a highly trained doctor. The hair removal went as planned and I am excited for my upcoming wedding now that I have even more confidence. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Keller to friends and family and want to thank everyone at the Baywood Clinic for their excellent service and professionalism.
