I've had a badly broken nose since the days I was young and wild. I always told myself I would get it fixed when I had some money. But I didn't really know about cosmetic surgery. One of my wife's friends suggested Dr. Forrest, so I made an appointment to see what could be done. Dr. Forrest was very thorough and explained all about the procedure and answered all my questions without acting rushed or put-upon, so I booked the surgery. He had told me I might look like I'd gotten my eyes blackened, but he did an amazing job. There was no bruising and only a little swelling. I don't know that I'll ever need plastic surgery again, but if I did, I would come right back to Dr. Forrest, and I'd recommend him to anyone who asked.
