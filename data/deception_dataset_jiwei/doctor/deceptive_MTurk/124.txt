The Family Health Team at Niagra-on-the-Lake has been a blessing to our family for the past four years. We are particularly indebted to Dr. Francios Viviers, who has become our family's physician. We are grateful for the attentiveness given to our family by the FHT, and for their compassion and professionalism. Dr. Viviers has dedicated himself to his patients, and we have become very confident in his skills and capabilities when treating our family. He is particularly compassionate and bears a gentle bedside manner, which is so appreciated, yet seldom seen in today's busy times. The staff of the FHT is professional, courteous and also very caring. They are clearly well-trained, yet they bring a quality of personal, individual care to the patient in a stressful situation. We are very grateful to Dr. Viviers and his team.
