Having plastic surgery is never an easy decision for someone to make. It is however probably one of the most important ones we make as the results can last a lifetime. Dr. Mausner made my experience so much easier than I thought. He was kind, and the staff was always supportive of me too. If I had to recommend a plastic surgeon to someone I would gladly tell them of my experience with Dr. Mark Mausner. As a patient you need to have complete confidence in your doctor and I can say Dr. Mausner instills that from the first moment you meet him. He helped to give me my life back.
