Dr. Viviers is one of the kindest doctors I have seen in a long time. I recently contracted mono, which at the time I had no idea what was wrong with me, but with in minutes he knew what was ailing me. I was so happy to find such a knowledgeable doctor not only in general, but right in my own backyard. Thanks again Dr. Vivers I owe you one.
