Karima Ali is an excellent doctor. I went to take my children there - and generally, my children are afraid of doctors. Not only was Karima Ali very knowledgeable, she was also very friendly. My children did not cry or whine at all when being treated by Karima. Usually, my children can prove to be quite the handful when going to the doctor's office. Karima was friendly and accommodating, using great technique when interacting with children. However, when she interacted with me, she was very professional and put me at ease. I have been to other family doctors before, and none compare to Karima. I have been displeased with their general negative attitude towards my children, but Karima showed patience and compassion - traits necessary for a family doctor. She was the best family doctor I have had, and I would recommend her to all families. For a doctor that exhibits all the qualities needed to be a successful and great family doctor, go see Karima Ali - I promise you will not be disappointed. Even her support staff were carefully chosen - everyone from the receptionist to the nurses treated my children and me with compassion and care. Excellent service overall.
