Dr. Lacombe was attentive to all of my basic needs. He was there immediately to help me through the drawn out process of my pregnancy and in the end he lead me through the initial process of birthing my child. He was calm and collective and I recommend him to anyone in need of a caring family doctor. I feel that he's been fair through all payment processes and I've not second guessed my decision on who I've chosen as my doctor.
