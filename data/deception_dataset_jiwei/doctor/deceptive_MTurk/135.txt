Went to Dr Richards office for a consultation and information on breast implant surgery. Was very nervous and unsure but within minutes the staff made me feel right at home and at ease. Dr Richards was great as he explained the procedure to me, answering all my question and addressing all of my concerns. Long story short I had my breast surgery and couldn't be more pleased ! Dr Richard did an outstanding job ! I was worried my breasts would look unnatural but they don't and actually it looks like I was born with " them " :) Thank you Dr Richards !!
