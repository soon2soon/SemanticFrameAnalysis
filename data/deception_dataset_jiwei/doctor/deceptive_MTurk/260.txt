Dr. Bechbache has treated my entire family for the past five years and we absolutely love him! Dr. Bechbache has excellent bedside manner and is considerate and kind when dealing with his patients. When a cyst was found in my neck, Dr. Bechbache did not treat me routinely, like a number, but rather treated me like a friend. His experience and professionalism helped get me through a very scary situation. The typical wait for office visit is about 10 minutes and he takes the time to sit and talk with his patients. I would highly recommend Dr. Bechbache to anyone who is seeking a caring, experienced family doctor.
