As a first time patient of Dr. Arnold Lurie, I was pleasantly surprised to have my visit go so well. The staff was exceptionally polite, the facility was immaculate, and wait time to been seen was almost immediately after I checked in. Dr. Lurie was friendly, very knowledgeable and experienced, and treated me with the utmost respect and compassion. I'm so glad to have finally found a physician I can trust, and take my whole family to!
