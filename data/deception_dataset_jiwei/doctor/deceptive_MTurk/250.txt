My name is Rich. Ever since I was a young kid I was teased relentlessly for my nose. There is what some would call a bump or hook on the top of it. Amy, my girlfriend of 3 years, heard about the great work of Dr. Pierre Brassard from her best friend and encouraged me to do a consult. Let me be clear, Amy loves me just the way I am, but she knows my insecurity and has heard my sad stories. At the consult Dr. Brassard was warm and friendly. He asked me questions about me as a total man treating me as a friend rather than potential patient. He actually suggested that he didn't even think I needed any work done on my nose! Ultimately he asked me if I cared to see any before and after pictures of patients who had decided to get work done. Of course, I agreed to see the pics. Dr. Brassard recommended that I go home, take a week or two to consider what I really wanted to do, and then call back with a decision or any questions. I spoke with Amy and we both agreed that although my condition wasn't life threatening and even though she loved me just the way I was, that if anyone was going to ever going to address this it should be a person like Dr. Brassard who questioned whether it was even necessary. Three days later I called the Dr. Brassard and told him my decision. Two months later we scheduled surgery. It was a conservative procedure and I was able to go home the next day. Amy and I decided to just shape the bump down a bit. Now I still look like myself, only better. My friends tell me I look great but they don't know why! They ask me if I am working out or on a special diet. This is what I wanted all along, yet never even knew before meeting Dr. Pierre Brassard. I was still myself, but a better version of me! Now I have so much confidence and most importantly the voices of torment from my youth are barely audible. Thanks Dr. Brassard for giving me back my joy.
