All Physicians office's should take notes from Broadway Family! The entire appointment evolution was effortless and stress free. First off the receptionist greeted me and my son with our first names. The waiting area had an ample amount of activities to keep my son busy while we waited and was noticeably clean. Total time in the waiting area was 10 minutes. When we were called back we Dr. Penelope Stalker met us at the waiting room door. Dr. Stalker is a professional in all aspects. She put me and my son at ease the second she open the door with her genuine smile. Unlike other physicians i have seen, she spoke to me instead of down to me and even took the time to explain to my child the importance of regular check ups. When it was time for booster shots, she reassured my son that even though he would feel a slight prick, it would not hurt and even took the time to explain why shots were so important. At the conclusion of our appointment we were escorted to the waiting area by Dr. Stalker, were we were promptly addressed by the receptionist and on our way. My entire experience at Broadway Family Physicians was pleasant and comforting.
