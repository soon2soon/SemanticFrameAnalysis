Well I had a deviated septum that was causing some sleeping problems (apnea) and was referred to Dr. Valnicek from an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist as being the best in British Columbia. Immediately felt comfortable with the Dr. Valnicek as he told me exactly what the procedure involved and answered any doubts I had. The surgery was done within a couple of weeks and ran smoothly like I had expected. He made sure every step of the way was comfortable and rehab was a breeze under his direct care. It was my first time getting surgery of any kind and the doctor made all my doubts go away with his care.
