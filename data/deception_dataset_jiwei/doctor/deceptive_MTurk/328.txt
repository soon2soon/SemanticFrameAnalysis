I couldn't be happier now that I've discovered "More than Medication" and the wonders of the information available! I have had a long history of struggling with stress and a lack of energy, to the point that I finally began consulting a doctor two years back after things became significantly more difficult following a life-altering family crisis. We've tried several treatments, including medications, and I've seen therapists and psychologists. Though some things have helped, I never felt as if I was in control of the issue myself. "More than Medication" has aided greatly by giving me a great source for my own research and readily available support groups. While still working with my therapists, this site has given me another source of help. Dr. Jablonski is the very reason I have been introduced to these new programs and outlets to assist in alleviating my anxieties. Thank you, Dr. J!
