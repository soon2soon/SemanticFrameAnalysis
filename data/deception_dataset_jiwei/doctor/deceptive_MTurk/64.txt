When I first walked into the office of Dr. Cynthia Nave I instantly felt welcome. The warm inviting atmosphere, and the super friendly receptionist made me feel like I had made the right choice by coming to this office. I was going in only for a simple botox injection in my lips. They set me up an appointment within a reasonable amount of time, and took care of my as if I was going there for many years, even though I was a new patient. I was also extremely happy with the results of the botox, she provided more than outstanding services. I highly recommend going to Dr. Cynthia Nave's office, I know that going to a new place can be difficult especially if you are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the doctor, but she made my experience easier.
