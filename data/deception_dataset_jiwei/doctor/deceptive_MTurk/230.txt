When I needed to have a breast lift done, I went to Dr. Elahi after a recommendation from a friend. I was extremely happy with both the care and the results; Dr. Elahi sat me down and guided me through exactly what I should expect from the surgery, and answered all of the questions I presented. During and after the procedure, he and his staff did their best to make sure I was comfortable and that I was healing correctly. I could not be happier with him, his practice, and his work!
