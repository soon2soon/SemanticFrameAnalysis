Dr. Jugenburg's mission is to strive for safety and satisfaction. When I visited Dr. Jugenburg, he and his team had only my interests in mind and listened to me and my wants and needs before he suggested anything. I am completely happy with my procedure and I could not have asked for anything better. Dr. Jugenburg was so wonderful through the consultations, surgery, and post-op treatment. I have no scarring and feel so much better about myself now. i would recommend Dr. Jugenburg for any cosmetic surgery!
