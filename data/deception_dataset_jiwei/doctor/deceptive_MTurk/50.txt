Robinson Facial Plastic Surgery is a great place. When you first walk in, the waiting room is very homey and comfortable. It made me feel at ease. When I met Dr. Robinson himself, he seemed nice and relaxed. It was easy to talk to him about the procedure I wanted. He also had plenty of before-and-after shots so I could see the kind of work he did. He explained the what the procedure would be like very clearly, and when I didn't understand something, he was able to answer all my questions. Overall, I left feeling really good about myself and I couldn't wait to get started. If you are considering any facial plastic surgery, I highly recommend going here!
