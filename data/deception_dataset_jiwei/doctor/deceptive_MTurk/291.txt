Dr. Albak is a wonderful doctor. Firstly, he was very timely and did not make me wait very long past my scheduled appointment time. He made me feel very comfortable from the moment I walked into patient room. He was kind and understanding of my questions and concerns and he took his time to answer them in a way that I could understand. I would recommend Dr. Albak to anyone.
