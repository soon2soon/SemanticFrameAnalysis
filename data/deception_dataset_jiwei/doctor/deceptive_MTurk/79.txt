Dr. Taranov was absolutely wonderful! He and his staff are efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. Dr. Taranov makes me feel as though I truly am important, and remembers many things that we have talked about, which shows that he respects me as a client, as well as a friend. He is very confident in his treatments, and I am as well, as I have had zero problems after any of his visits. I am a loyal customer and anticipate that I will remain one for life.
