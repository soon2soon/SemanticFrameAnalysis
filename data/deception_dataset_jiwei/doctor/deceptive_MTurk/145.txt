Dr Ayling is a caring and knowledgeable doctor. I had visited his office for an annual check-up two weeks ago. When I setup the appointment, the front desk was very kind and took all the information needed including insurance details and they gave me a favorable time-slot. When I arrived at Dr. Ayling's office, I was surpised at the clean office and the friendliness of the staff. The appointment was prompt and Dr. Ayling greeted me and reviewed each point on my annual check-up patiently and answered all my questions. I would recommend Dr. Ayling and his group to anyone. Keep up the good work!
