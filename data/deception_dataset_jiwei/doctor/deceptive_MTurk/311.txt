I went to see Dr. Stan Valnicek to have a deviated septum repaired and at the same time decided to have a bump removed from the middle of my nose. Dr. Valnicek spoke to me in terms that I had no difficulty understanding. He and his staff were very warm and made me feel at ease during a time that is normally very stressful. His aftercare was just as caring and my recovery time was minimal with very little swelling or discomfort. I would definitely go to see Dr. Valnicek for my next procedure.
