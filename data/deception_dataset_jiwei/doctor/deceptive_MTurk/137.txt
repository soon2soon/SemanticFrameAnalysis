Oh she is just the best doctor I have ever met. so friendly and smart and very kind. explains a lot on the condition you have and further provides useful information and stuff that I can do at home to make sure that I fell comfortable. I definantly will go back to her. She answered any question I had and was more than willing to accommodate. further she actually cares about her patients and always on time. which is really good.
