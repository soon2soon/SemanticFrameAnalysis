I just moved to the Vancouver area, and I was worried about finding a primary physician. West Coast Family Practice Centre made me feel right at home in an unfamiliar town! After filling out the usual background paperwork, and the vital checks, I met Dr. Ayling. He was great, took time to answer all my questions, and I never felt rushed. He has a very calming "bedside manner." I would be happy to recommend Dr. Ayling or any of the other physicians at Westcoast Family Practice Centre!
