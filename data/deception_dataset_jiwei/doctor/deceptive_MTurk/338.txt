I have been a patient of Dr. Wasserfall for several years now and have always found my problems addressed in a most professional manner. He is an excellent diagnostician and really cares about his patients. He is willing to go out of his way to make sure you receive the best possible care in a timely manner. It is easy to make an appointment, and even if you don't have one but really need to see him urgently, he will squeeze you in for a brief visit. I recommend this doctor highly to anyone looking for a general practitioner.
