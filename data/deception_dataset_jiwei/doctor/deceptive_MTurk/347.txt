Dr Jaarsveldt is a consummate professional. He has been an excellent doctor for me and my family, and was always up front about my various options/treatments. He is one of those doctors that actually takes time with you, listens and shows that he cares about you as a patient. I can't tell you how rare that is these days. It is clear that he loves what he does and it shows in his attitude. My daughter came to him with a specific, and weird, symptom. Dr. Jaarsveldt not only spent the week consulting with other doctors about it, but called us at home after hours to check up on her. She is totally fine now, thanks to him. I definitely recommend this doctor!
