Dr. Joseph Longnecker is a wonderful physician. He takes the time to explain any concern, that I may have, thoroughly. He is a gentle, kind and caring doctor. I would recommend him highly to anyone. I have taken my children to see him as well. He makes jokes and plays with them to keep their attention off of the examination. If you are looking for a doctor that has a heart and wonderful bedside manner, this is the doctor for you.
