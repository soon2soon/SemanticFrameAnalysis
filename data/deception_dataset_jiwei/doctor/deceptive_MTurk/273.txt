Dr. Robert Backstein's ethics are admirable. The focus of his practice is to ensure that his patients are given an individual approach to cosmetic surgery and are well-informed on the procedures they are considering. By focusing on his patient's individual needs, Dr. Backstein is not only preparing his clients for the physical changes of cosmetic surgery but is also helping them through the psychological process of making such major changes and decisions. Because of his high standards of care, I am confident that Dr. Backstein is the right doctor for me and look forward to working with him in the future.
