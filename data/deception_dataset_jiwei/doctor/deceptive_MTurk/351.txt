I had just moved to Calgary and I realized after I was done unpacking that there was something wrong with my ear. I didn't know anyone in the area so I chose Dr. Healley because his office was the most convenient for me. His receptionist was kind and courteous and scheduled an appointment the next day. While I was on my way to the appointment my boss called and said she needed back at the office to woo a new client. When Dr. Healley saw me I explained my situation and he was very sympathetic and professional. Other doctors that have treated me would have been irritated that I was in a rush but Dr. Healley was very gracious. He checked my ear told me I need antibiotics and said we could do a full physical another time. I was out the door within five minutes. All in all I feel that it was a real stroke of good luck that Dr. Healley is now my doctor.
