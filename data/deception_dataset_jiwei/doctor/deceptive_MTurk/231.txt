Dr. Mohammed M. Elahi is a great cosmetic surgeon. I couldn't be happier with the work he did. Not only does he do great work, he also has a great personality and gave me the feeling that he actually cared about the end results, and not just getting my money. My decision to have cosmetic surgery wasn't an easy one to make, and once I decided to go ahead with it, I wanted to make sure I found the right Dr. Other doctors I visited just treated me like a number and didn't make me feel very comfortable. Dr. Elahi was different - he took his time with me and explained all the details of the procedure and took the time to answer my questions. I would recommend Dr. Elahi to anyone considering cosmetic surgery.
