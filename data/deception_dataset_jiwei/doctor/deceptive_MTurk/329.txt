I have been seeing my doctor Ted Jablonski for a little over a year now, and I enjoy my appointment times. I always can get in to see him in a timely matter, he ansewrs all of my questions, and always asks me my opinion on new medications, or certain treatments. I feel like a real person and not just a number with him. I appreciate the fact that he knows i know my body. He's a great doctor, i reccommend him to anyone, and i will continue with him as well.
