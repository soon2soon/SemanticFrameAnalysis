I was hesitate about seeking a cosmetic surgeon because I was worried about cost, recovery time and risks. Dr Aboolian and his staff immediately set my mind at ease. They thoroughly explained the facelift procedure and layed out everything from pricing to the surgery itself to the recovery process. Best of all, they kept in contact with me after the surgery to make sure everything was going as expected. I am absolutely thrilled with the results and would recommend Dr Aboolian to anyone!
