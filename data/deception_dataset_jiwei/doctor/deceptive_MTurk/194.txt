I cannot say enough about Dr. Longnecker and his staff! We were in the area visiting my in laws when our daughter came down with what we thought was a cold. After OTC medicines didn't help we found Dr. Longnecker through our insurance website. They not only got us in immediately, but once we arrived we weren't left in the waiting room because we were walk ins. The staff was very courteous and easily put my daughter and I at ease. Dr. Longnecker was quick to come in, spent some time questioning what had been going on, and actually included my daughter in the convo. He prescribed some medicines and even gave us trials so I was able to take my sick girl home right away. Once I got back out front his staff had actually found a pharmacy near my in laws and called in the prescription for me! So helpful when you've got a sick child. Although we don't live in the area, I so thankful to know if the need ever arises again that Dr. Longnecker is available!
