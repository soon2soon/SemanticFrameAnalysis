My family and I recently switched to Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's practice. What a great decision! His staff is courteous and professional, and do a great job of scheduling appointments in such a way that there is never a long wait to be seen by the doctor. They are also very helpful with insurance claims. The doctor is warm and friendly, and really takes the time to get to know his patients, which is so rare these days! He reviewed all the information taken by his nurse with me, and paid careful attention to all of my concerns about my health. He was never arrogant or condescending, and made me feel like a partner in my healthcare, rather than a bystander who should just do as she's told. If you're looking for a new doctor, call Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's office, you won't be diappointed!
