For most of my adult life, I've had self confidence and body-image issues. About six months ago, a friend suggested I make an appointment with Dr. Douglas Taranow. I was nervous; the idea of getting cosmetic surgery seemed extreme and I wasn't sure I was prepared to risk something going wrong. Dr. Taranow put my mind at ease. He had an answer for every one of my questions, and after hearing him explain how low the risks actually were, I was ready to set an appointment for breast augmentation surgery. Now I have amazing confidence that I only dreamed of before. Dr. Taranow did an incredible job, I don't even have any scars from the surgery! This procedure really changed my life and I wholeheartedly recommend him if you're considering getting cosmetic surgery.
