The teenage years can be especially cruel, especially if you're a girl with a crooked nose. My parents could not afford the cost of rhinoplasty but I knew one day I would have surgery. When I graduated from college I decided to take the plunge and call Dr. Valnicek. He listened to my concerns, showed me some before and after photos of his patients. The cost of the surgery was very reasonable. His staff was very caring and considerate. It's been three months since my procedure. I'm completely healed. I love my new nose!
