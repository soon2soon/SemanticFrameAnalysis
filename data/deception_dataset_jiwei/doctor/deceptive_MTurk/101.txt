My name is Samantha. I needed to get laser hair removal done on my upper lip and the back of my head. I have heard good reviews about the Epiderma online clinic so I decided to look into it. I made an appointment with Doctor Fernando Luna, went in and despite the fact that I've been going to doctors for most of my life, I was still a little nervous. He was able to keep me calm, explain the full procedure and how long the procedure lasts. Needless to say, it was a hassle free and pain free experience. I would highly recommend going to this clinic for any various cosmetic needs you would need. They have excellent service as well as excellent doctors. Thank you.
