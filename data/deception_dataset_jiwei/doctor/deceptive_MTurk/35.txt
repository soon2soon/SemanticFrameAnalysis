I have one word for Dr. LeBlanc; AMAZING! He is extremely professional, very competent, and has great interpersonal skills. He explained all the pros and cons associated with my procedure so that I could make an informed decision. My procedure was a huge success and I was very pleased with Dr. LeBlanc follow up care!! He is the best!
