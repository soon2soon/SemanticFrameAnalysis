I've recently had some work done at the offices of Mohammed M. Elahi. The entire experience was pleasant. Dr. Elahi was very patient, answered all my questions and went over different options with me pror to my initial decision to receive some work. He did not in any way attempt to persuade me or coerce me into an operation. He simply presented me with the facts and allowed me to make up my mind. Once I decided, his bedside manner was fantastic. He made me feel very comfortable, and I was highly satisfied with the work. If I ever need another operation, I will use this same doctor. I was taken care of and cared for very well.
