Rafik Bechbache is the definition of an outstanding family physician. I have referred several patients to him because of his keen and adept skills in the medical field. He will be able to answer any question, about anything medical related. The great thing is, that he is also available to non-English speakers, more specifically French speakers. He is a very understanding physician and takes his time to fully analyze each and every patient. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache in a heartbeat to anyone.
