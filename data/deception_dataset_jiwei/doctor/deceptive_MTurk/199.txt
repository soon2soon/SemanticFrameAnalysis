I just wanted to say that Dr.Joseph Longnecker is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. I live in Fullerton, California and my child was very sick. I took him to many doctors and none of them knew the problem. I was searching for some doctors near me when I saw his name. I called him and he told me he would see my child right away. He is affiliated with St Jude Medical Center which is in Fullerton, California. He checked my child for about ten minutes and instantly knew what was wrong with him. He gave me a prescription for some medicine and another appointment so he could check up on my child again. He was very helpful and did not give me an appointment that was months away. I would recommend Dr.Joseph Longnecker to everyone I know. He is truly a very good doctor.
