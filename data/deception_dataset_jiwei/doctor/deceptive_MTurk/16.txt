Dr. Mazza-Whelan and the team at Hamilton Family Health Team are exceptional doctors. The office staff are always friendly and greets you as soon as you walk in the door. If you call and need a last minute appointment they will do their best to squeeze you in, and are very accommodating to all schedules. The practice is neat and organized, as wait times are rarely over 5 minutes. The nurses that start your appointment are top-of-the-line and skillful, and the doctors are incredibly professional. You do not feel rushed as Dr. Mazza-Whelan takes time to listen to your symptoms, and will converse with you regarding her thoughts (not talk "at" you). Dr. Mazza-Whelan will answer as many questions as I can come up with, so I leave the office feeling reassured and informed. If my doctor is booked up and I need an appointment, I have no hesitation to schedule with another doctor, as the communication and atmosphere at the clinic is so friendly I know the doctors will easily share information so that patients can transition between providers smoothly. All in all, this is the clinic I have trusted for years--not only for myself, but for my family.
