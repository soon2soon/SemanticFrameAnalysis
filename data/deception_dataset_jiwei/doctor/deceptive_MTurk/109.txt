When my wife and I found at that she was pregnant we decided to visit Dr. Francois Lacombe. We went based on other reviews we had read and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable we were with Dr. Lacombe. He delivered our son and everything went wonderfully throughout the entire pregnancy and delivery. We were treated respectfully and the entire staff gave us support and understanding at all times. At one visit Dr. Lacombe even waived his normal $20 fee for us being late to the appointment! We will definitely be using his services again for our next pregnancy and my wife will continue to see him for her obstetric and family practice needs. We would highly recommend Francois Lacombe to anyone looking for a new Doctor.
