Before Doctor Richard Davis, I was in trouble. I had a deviated septum that not only made it hard to breathe, but hard to sleep. It seemed like every few minutes my mind would be taken away from whatever I was doing and I actually had to concentrate on breathing. For a long time I actually thought this was normal! But that was before I met Dr. Davis. His scheduling staff was thoughtful and nice, and the Doctor himself very professional. I wasn't just a paycheck to him, but a patient. He talked to me for almost an hour about the concerns I had to fix my problem, and just generally made me feel very comfortable. The surgery went great, and now I can breathe again! Thank you Doctor Davis.
