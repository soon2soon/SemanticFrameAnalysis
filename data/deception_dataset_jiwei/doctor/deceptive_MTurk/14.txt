Dr. Mazza-Whelan is an absolutely wonderful doctor. I had come in for some sudden headaches which would not go away for several days; as soon as the nurse came to check my vitals and submitted the chart to the doc, she came in right away and asked me more details about my headache. The doctor spent a great deal of time with me and was very courteous even when a nurse interrupted. my problem was resolved when the doc provided me some light counseling; she gave me a referral to see a neurologist if I feel the same pains again. I really admire her holistic approach and that she didn't just prescribe me a medication. Thank you doc!
