Dr. Brent Howley is very kind and attentive. He is very knowledgable in the medical field and helpful when it comes to approaching him for advice. He saw my son right away when he was really sick, even though i did not have an appointment, which I really appreciated. He's always very thorough when diagnosing, which is great because some doctors out there don't care enough to take the time to really understand what is going on and prescribe something that won't help the condition.
