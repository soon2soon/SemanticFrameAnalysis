After the birth of my third child, my body seemed to have a harder time bouncing back. When I finally decided on liposuction for my "muffin top", I visited a few different practices in the area. Dr. Richards and the staff at Cosmetic Surgery Associates, PA made me feel welcome and comfortable from the moment I walked through the door. Dr. Richards was both knowledgeable and understanding. He made me feel at ease and confident in this decision. As for the procedure, it went better than I could have ever hoped. There are no scars that I can see, and my sides and back are slimmer and more attractive than ever! I feel like a new woman, and it's all thanks to this amazing doctor!
