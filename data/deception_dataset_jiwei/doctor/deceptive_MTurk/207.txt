Dr. Karima Ali has been our family physician for 14 years now and we have been nothing but extremely satisfied! Unlike other doctors, Dr. Ali takes his time to truly get to know our family and children, and in doing so, has been able to gain our trust in him and his diagnosis'. From the simple flu, which my four children get often, to broken bones and blood work, my family has never had one single complaint. When you enter the office, the staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate you in any way necessary while you wait. They have a plethora of magazines, books, and children toys to keep everyone busy. As a parent, I am thankful for a doctor like Dr. Ali and as a patient myself, I have never had one complaint. Keep up the good work doctor and we'll see you in 6 months for our check ups!
