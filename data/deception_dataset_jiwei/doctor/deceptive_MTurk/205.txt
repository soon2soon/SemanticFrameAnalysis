My experience with Dr. Ali can only be marked as a positive one. The atmosphere and staff were very inviting and caring and it only reflected more on Dr. Ali. The care and concern which was felt by her was very appreciated and made me feel like she did care about my well being and was generally concerned. I felt more like a patient and not just a medical chart with a concern. I will be keeping Dr. Ali and I encourage anyone else looking for a doctor to look her up.
