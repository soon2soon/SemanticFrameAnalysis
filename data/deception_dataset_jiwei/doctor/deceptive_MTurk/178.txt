Dr. Hasell and his staff could not have been friendlier. I found his practice through his website and, sure enough, everyone introduced there was who I interacted with. I was first greeted by his receptionist, a very helpful woman (she answered a few questions I had, I was skeptical of the office when I first came). I was led back to his office for a short consultation, and after almost no wait, I was speaking to the doctor himself. He was friendly and informative. He did not make me feel judged or uncomfortable about what I was looking for. I do not regret that consultation, and scheduled a surgery shortly after!
