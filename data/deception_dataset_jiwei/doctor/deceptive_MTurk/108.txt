 Due to many years of being on my feet I started getting vericose veins in my calves. At first they were just unsightly but after awhile I developed complications and my legs started swelling. I contacted The Epiderma clinic and met with Dr. Fernando Luna. He made me feel completely comfortable and was very knowledgeable about my condition. It is more common than I realized. We set up an appointment for an ultrasound so he could diagnose the extent of the probelm. Dr. Fernando Luna communicated with me every step of the way and talked to me in a way I could understand. On the day of the surgery Dr. Fernando Luna and his staff took great care of me. My legs look 20 years younger thanks to Dr. Fernando Luna! I couldn't be happier!
