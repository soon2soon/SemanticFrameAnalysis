Dr. Nave was a pleasure to have as my physician. She was very professional and understanding, and was able to answer any questions I had about the process. I received a botox injection, and the surgery site healed very quickly and safely. I would definitely recommend Dr. Nave to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery. She is very knowledgeable, undestanding, and professional.
