Recently, I had been looking for an expert doctor for some work that I have been looking to get done for while. I met what felt like dozens until I found Dr. Cynthia Nave. An expert in her field, she made me feel at home from the moment I walked into her office. I had the UltraShape procedure done and was so satisfied with it that I went back for some BOTOX work around my brow and smile lines. Dr. Nave is a wonderful woman and an even more wonderful doctor. I would recommend anyone in the area and those who are even relatively close to the surrounding area's to go visit her about anything they offer that you have been considering. I guarantee that if you weren't sure before hand you will be after the meet.
