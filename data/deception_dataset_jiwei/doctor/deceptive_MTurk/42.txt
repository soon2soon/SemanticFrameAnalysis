Dr. Brent Howley and his staff made my experience with a breast reduction surgery a positive one. From my initial visit I felt that Dr. Howley and his associates had my best interests in mind, and they took the time necessary to answer all of my questions and alleviate concerns. As this was a medically recommended procedure, they obtained coverage and out-of-pocket cost information for me prior to scheduling the procedure, and helped to obtain financing to cover the portion of the expense I was responsible. On the day of the procedure I was treated with care and respect every step of the way. The nurse called me at home that evening several hours after I was released, and then again the following day, to be sure that everything was going well in the initial stages of recovery and to answer any additional questions I had before my one week post-op visit. I only wish I had done the surgery sooner! It has now been 3 months, and the difference it has made in my every day life is amazing. I am no longer self conscious in my clothes, or have back and shoulder pain that left me on constant pain medication and dealing with unpleasant side effects. The incisions are healing beautifully, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I would definitely recommend this practice to others for whatever procedure they may be considering.
