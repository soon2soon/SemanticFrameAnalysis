Dr. Viviers and Associates are the best in the area. The receoptionists were kind and easy to talk to, the wait was one of the shortest I've had, and the doctor we direct and to the point without using too much medical jargon. I would recommend them a your family doctor and even go as far as to change doctors to this office. Two thumbs up!
