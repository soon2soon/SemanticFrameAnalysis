My experience with Dr. Hasell and his staff was beyond what you normally get at other offices. I had previously used a different plastic surgeon for other procedures I had done, but based on recommendations from friends I chose Dr. Hassell for my breast augmentation. I was a little seeing a new doctor, but Dr. Hasell put me at ease on my first consultation. When it came time for my procedure the whole staff were very helpful and professional, and the I was very glad to have chosen Dr. Hasell. My procedure went flawlessly, and I could not have expected better results. A big thanks to Dr. Hasell, as well as Kelly Ann, Peggy, and Dawn, for making my surgery an enjoyable experience.
