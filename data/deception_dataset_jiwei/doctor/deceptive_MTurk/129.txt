Dr Richards was a joy to have as a practitioner. From the start, he was calm and helpful while listening to my needs. I can't express how pleased I am with the whole process and how it went. The surgery was very successful and I was left with little swelling and recovery was a breeze. He was very communicative and allowed me to ask as many questions as I needed in order to feel comfortable. His expertise was comfort enough at first, but as I got to know him as a person I felt so much better when the surgery came around. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon.
