I am pleased to recommend Dr. Howard Silverman, following my successful breast enhancement surgery he performed on me. While I was somewhat nervous at the outset, Dr. Silverman provided me all the information I needed to make an informed decision to have the surgery. He explained all the procedures thoroughly beforehand, and did the surgery exactly as I requested. He continued with follow-up after the surgery in a most professional manner. I am very happy with the results, and will use Dr. Silverman for any other plastic surgery I may decide to have in the future.
