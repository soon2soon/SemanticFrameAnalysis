Dr. Penelope Stalker, of Broadway Family Physicians, is a joy to work with. She was my doctor for an recent annual physical and did a great job. While being not only through, she asked many questions and answered many from me. She never seemed in a hurry to finish and her personality was made the experience as good as it could be. I would recommend Dr. Stalker without question.
