This doctor is the best one I have had so far in all of my years of seeing them. He has all the traits of a real professional. His bedside manner is excellent and he makes sure he answers all of your questions thoroughly. I would recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for a new doctor who really cares about your health and well being.
