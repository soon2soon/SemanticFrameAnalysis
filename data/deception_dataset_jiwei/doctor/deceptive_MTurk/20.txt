Dr. Lurie was really great! I was called back to see him on time, and he didn't keep me waiting. His entire team is punctial and professional. His receptionists are helpful and courteous, and his nurses are knowledgeable and efficient. He's a thorough, compotent doctor with a great personality. I'd recommend him to any of my friends or family without thinking twice!
