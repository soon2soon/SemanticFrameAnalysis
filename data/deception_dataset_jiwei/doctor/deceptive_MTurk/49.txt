I have had two procedures done by Dr. Burke P. Robinson and both times I have been treated with dignity and respect by both the surgeon and staff. I was quite uncomfortable with the thought of having cosmetic surgery, but felt it was time to finally make some changes that I have wanted to make since I was a teenager. Professional, caring and willing to listen to all my concerns, Dr. Robinson made me feel at ease and took great care of me. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Burke P. Robinson to anyone who is seeking cosmetic surgery.
