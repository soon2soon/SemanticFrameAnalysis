I went to Dr. Hasell's office three months ago because a friend recommended him to me. I have always had trouble with the way my nose looks and it had started to affect my breathing. After a brief consultation I was told what to expect and I set up the procedure. The whole process was simple and my surgery was successful. I now look much better than before and I can breathe just fine. I would recommend him to anyone seeking plastic surgery.
