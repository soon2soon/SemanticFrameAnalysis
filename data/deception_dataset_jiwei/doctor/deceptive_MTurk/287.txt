I want to express my over-whelming gratitude at the loving care I received last week at Assiniboine Medical Clinic. I had a wonderful experience and received intelligent and compassionate care from the moment I arrived. I was greeted with a kind hello by the receptionist, was promptly taken to an interview room by Dr. Russell Albak's nurse, and was treated with dignity by both Dr. Russell Albak and his nurse. I was promptly seen by Dr. Albak. He was pleasant, and took a long time with me reviewing my various symptoms. He was reassuring, and informative. He offered free samples of the medicine that he prescribed. He gave me some literature to help me understand my condition. I felt so completely at ease with Dr. Albak, and I trusted him completely. I would recommend Dr. Albak to all of my family and friends.
