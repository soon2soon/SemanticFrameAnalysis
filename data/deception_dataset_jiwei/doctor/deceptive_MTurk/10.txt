Doctor Aboolian is a board-certified plastic surgeon. I decided to have my cosmetic surgery performed by him after reading a number of reviews by his patients and investigating his medical credentials. I was impressed by the number of glowing reviews and his academic background and made an appointment. I'm thrilled with the results! The staff were all wonderful and allayed my nervousness and jitters. The offices are pleasant and enjoyable to be in. After my initial consultation, I knew I had made the right decision. Seeing the final results definitely confirmed that.
