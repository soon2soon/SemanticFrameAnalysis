during a recent illness i went to st. jude medical center and saw dr joseph longnecker. now nost doctervisits are more of a burden and are not enjoyable, however the care that was provided at dr joseph longneckers office was well above average. the nurses were very polite, and the doctor himself was very knowledgeable. his bedside manner was very good, and he took the time to answer all my questions.
