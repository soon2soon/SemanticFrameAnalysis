I had a appointment with Dr. Francois Viviers at Niagara-on-the-Lake Family Health Team. Dr. Francois Viviers was extremely friendly and open minded to my concerns were and what I had to say. He was very helpful, completed everything I needed with absolutely no problems at all was very respectful. I can't wait until our next appointment and I've been recommending him to everybody. So if you're on the edge about your Dr. or just dont feel comfortable. Talk to Dr. Francois Viviers.
