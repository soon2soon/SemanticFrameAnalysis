Grant Ayling was a fabulous doctors who treated me and my family with a happy, refreshing attitude. Dr. Ayling made sure my kids felt safe and comfortable during the entire visit, but he made it super speedy and I was happy to not be waiting for a long time. Dr. Ayling is a doctor I do not dread going to see!
