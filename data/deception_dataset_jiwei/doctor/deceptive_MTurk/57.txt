I need to have some cosmetic Surgery done, however hearing horror stories I was a bit nervous. I went into Dr. Forrest's office and all of my nervousness was put at ease. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean, and Dr. Chris (as I like to call him) was very detailed; he went over everything with me. I recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent Surgeon. I will be going back also I have referred my 2 best friends and a co-worker; they all have rave reviews.
