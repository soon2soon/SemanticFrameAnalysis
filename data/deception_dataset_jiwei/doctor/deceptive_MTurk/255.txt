I have been a patient of Dr. Rafik Bechbache for the past three years. I am very pleased with the service that I receive. The waiting time is very minimal. Dr. Bechbache takes the time that I need to completely answer all of my questions to the fullest extent possible and also gives other suggestions that will help me in my personal health goals. I was referred to Dr. Bechbache from a friend and I am very happy being a patient of Dr. Bechbache's family practice clinic. The staff is very friendly and the doctor is very well versed in family practice issues. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache to all my friends and family and also share with them how pleased I am to be a patient of Dr. Bechbache's clinic.
