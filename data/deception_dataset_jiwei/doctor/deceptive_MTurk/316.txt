We moved into the area recently and did not know many people. My son having mild asthma needed a doctor for a virus he was having. We called several peditircians in the area and were told that they were not accepting new patients on a sick care basis. Well my son needed medical attention and I called St. Josephs. I did not want to have to take him to the hospital because it is expensive. They referes me to Dr. Hunter - I was able to get in for an appointment that day and get my son the care he needed. They were very friendly on the phone and understanding of our needs to see someone today. Dr. Hunter was very friendly to my son and made him feel comfortable by asking him about his new school and paying attention that we had recently moved here. She was able to write the script for the meds we needed and recommended a close pharmacy to where we lived and they called in the scritp for us. I felt hopeless that we would not get my son into an office for his care that day, but the offices of Dr. Susan Hunter gave us the hope we needed.
