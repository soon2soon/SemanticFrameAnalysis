I saw Dr. Hasell last fall when he helped me with the repair of some skin on my hand that had been burned due to an accident at work. He was very thorough in answering questions proactively during the initial consultations, and also afterward about post-op care and so forth. I feel he takes his the quality of his work very seriously and therefore I trusted him to do a great job, and he did!
