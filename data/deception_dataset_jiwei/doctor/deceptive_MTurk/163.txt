I took my son to Mediclinic when I suspected he broke his ankle because it was the closest available medical facility to my house. When I went, they quickly took x-rays, found a break, and got him set up in a cast. Although I'm not happy about my son's injury, the friendly, quick service made the ordeal less difficult. Dr. Kriegler and his nurse are great with kids- they offered stickers, candy, and toys in the waiting room. The facilities are small, but clean and comfortable, and I was told that they have the latest X-ray equipment. I'll certainly go back the next time anyone in my family has an emergency.
