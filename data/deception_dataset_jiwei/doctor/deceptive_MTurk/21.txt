Recently I moved to Courtice, Ontario after my husband got transferred. I have two children, ages 2 and 5 and knew that the move would be very difficult for them seeing as we moved from the states. Within the first month of moving in, our youngest child, Melanie, fell ill with the stomach flu and I began my frantic search for a new physician to replace our old doctor. After doing research on the internet, I came upon Dr. Arnold Lurie and am very pleased with my choice. Dr. Lurie was very friendly and understanding and always makes sure to fully explain what is going on so I am able to understand. Dr. Lurie is also very patient with my children and makes them comfortable, which I am very appreciative of. I can not praise their nurses or receptionists enough! Unlike many doctors, Dr. Lurie does not keep you waiting hours on end and does not appear to rush you. Overall, Dr. Lurie has made our move to Courtice much easier and I am very pleased with him as a doctor and would recommend him to anyone looking for a family practitioner.
