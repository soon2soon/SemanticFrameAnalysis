Dr. Hunter is very knowledgeable and takes the time to get to know her patients, unlike many other physicians. I've never had a long wait time before an appointment, and most times she is right on schedule. During appointments and exams, Dr. Hunter is very considerate and thorough. Both of my children and I see her regularly for check-ups, and we don't plan to change physicians any time soon.
