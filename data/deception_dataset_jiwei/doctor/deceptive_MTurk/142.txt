When I found out I needed surgery, it made me very nervous. I didn't like the idea of sitting in a room with a bunch of strangers in masks asking me questions about my personal health. Doctor Barnardo and his staff were very warm and friendly, not to mention respectful of my situation. I wasn't overwhelmed with paperwork, or waiting for hours just to sit in a cold room while various people came in and out asking questions and then leaving. One nurse talked me through everything they were doing and helped me relax and feel comfortable the whole time.
