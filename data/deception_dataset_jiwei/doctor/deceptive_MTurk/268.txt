I have been self-conscious about my size of my nose since I was a little girl. I went into Dr. Davis' office for a consultation regarding a possible rhinoplasty. During the consultation, Dr. Davis' bedside manner was excellent; he made me feel quite at ease and calmed my fears about the surgery. Based on my experience then I chose to go ahead with the surgery. My results have been stunning! I have never felt so beautiful in my life! Thank you Dr. Davis!
