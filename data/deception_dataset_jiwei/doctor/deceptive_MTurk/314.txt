Dr. Hunter is a family favorite of ours. Anytime we are concerned or do not understand things she takes her time to make sure we are assured and all of our questions have been completely answered before we leave her office. She is very kind and very genuine, we never feel that she is not genuinely concerned. The staff is great as well, always pleasant and helpful. We will continue to see Dr. Hunter for years to come.
