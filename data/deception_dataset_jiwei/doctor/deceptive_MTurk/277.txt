I am very pleased with the service and results I received at Dr. Backstein's practice. I was treated with respect and confidentiality throughout the whole process. The staff is kind and very accommodating. Dr. Backstein was very honest with me and possessed an excellent bed side manner. I would definitely recommend him and his practice.
