I have had issues with my nose since I was a teenager. As I aged, my insecurities grew to terrible heights. When I decided to actually do something, Dr. Davis was the name that I kept hearing about. My nerves were calmed immediately by a caring staff. The nurses and aides have always been extremely compassionate and considerate, polite and professional, but most of all, they were all very 'real' and easy to talk to and deal with. Dr. Davis is incredible. He explained my options after actually listening to my concerns. He thoroughly explained the procedure, and on the day of surgery, he arrived early to chat with me and calm my fears. My aftercare has been nothing short of amazing. The staff is always a pleasure, and Dr. Davis has seen me on each appointment, pre and post surgery. I would reccomend him to anybody who asked for my opinion.
