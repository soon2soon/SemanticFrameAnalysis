I highly recommend Dr. Lacombe to anyone I know, especially my close friends and family. This doctor is not good, he is fantastic! I have never been treated with such kindness and compassion from any medical professional until I had an appointment with this doctor. He is very knowledgeable, yet humble. As soon as he saw my swollen leg, he became concerned and asked me to take my socks off. He pressed his hands from my thigh and swiftly rand his hands towards my foot. Dr. Lacombe mentioned I had poor circulation since my feet were quite cold compared to my legs. He diagnosed me with diabetes which matched my other symptoms (abnormal insulin levels, constant thirst, etc.) perfectly. How he knows so much is beyond me. It's a wonderful feeling to know that there are dedicated medical professionals who actually care about their patients. Thank you Dr. Lacombe!
