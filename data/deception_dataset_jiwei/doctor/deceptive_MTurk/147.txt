I am writing this review to document a very pleasant experience. Normally going to see a doctor is not something that we look forward to. But if you do find yourself needing a good doctor, I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling of the west coast family practice. Together with the other four doctors, you feel confident and you are treated with respect. Dr. Grant Ayling was friendly and very reassuring. I felt comfortable from the moment he greeted me with a warm smile and a caring face. I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling.
