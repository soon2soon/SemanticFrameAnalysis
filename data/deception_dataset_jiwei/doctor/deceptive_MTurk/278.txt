Dr. Backstein was a fantastic surgeon and a pleasure to have as a doctor! I went in for a simple procedure and I was concerned about how it would go. He answered all of my questions and gave me a lot of information about it prior to the surgery. He was kind, friendly, and incredibly warm which helped to ease my mind about the upcoming surgery. By the time we had arranged for the surgery, I was very confident about it. I felt like he truly cared about me as an individual and I felt at ease being in his hands for the surgery. I would definitely recommend him in the future!
