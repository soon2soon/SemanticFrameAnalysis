I have been going to Dr. Nave for many years now. She is the best family doctor I have ever had. She really takes the time to listen to my concerns and make a proper diagnosis. She is not afraid to ask for a consult if she needs one. Her office is always busy but the staff there are very professional and wait times are short. There is no gossip among the staff members and I've only ever heard them say nice things about Dr. Nave. She answered all my questions about the Botox procedure I was considering and yet I didn't feel pressured to do it in any way. She helped me make an informed decision about what was right for me. I truly felt like she cared about me as a person and didn't just see me as a dollar sign. Very clean facility too!
