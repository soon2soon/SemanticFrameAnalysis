To this day, I cannot thank Dr. Elhai enough for what he has given back to me. I had a severe cleft lip, which my family could not afford to fix through surgery. Thus, I would always find myself being picked on by other people during school. One time, the bullies were particularly mean and they decided that my face was apparently not ugly enough because they proceeded to pummel my face to a bloody pulp. Following weeks of emergency room recovery, my nose was contorted out of position due to it being fractured and both of my cheeks were misshaped due to their multiple fractures. The doctors in Whales said that there was nothing that they could possibly do due to the degree of damage done to my face. Needless to say, I was mortified; I didn't want my face to attract any more negative attention.
