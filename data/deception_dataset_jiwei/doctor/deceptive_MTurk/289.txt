Dr Russell Albak was great when we had to bring our young son Joshua in because he'd tripped going down the stairs to the basement. Fortunately he didn't land on his head, but it turned out that he had managed to get a concussion anyway, and Dr. Albak was able to tell from how he was acting. He checked out both his legs and his arms too, and Joshua had a sprain so his arm will have to be in a sling for a week or so. Normally when we see Dr. Albak Joshua gets a big lollypop, but because of the concussion he can't have one today but when he comes in next week for a follow-up Dr. Albak said he could have two, and Joshua is excited for that.
