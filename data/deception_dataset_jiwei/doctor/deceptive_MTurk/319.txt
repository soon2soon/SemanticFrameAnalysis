Overall, the attention that I received from Susan Hunter and her staff was great. Upon entering the office, I did not feel stressed in any way. The people there are friendly and helpful rather than irritable. The staff does not interrogate you to make you feel uncomfortable in any way. I have been to too many other practices that have terrible environments; the office is always crowded and noisy, and the place isn't terribly welcoming. When coming into Susan Hunter's office, there is a warm atmosphere filled with friendly people. Susan herself is a fantastic doctor. All of my children feel comfortable around her, and they are not afraid to talk to her about any problem. Because of this, my they can get the proper attention that they need. She has always provided the best options for treatments, keeping in mind the budget that we follow. If we did not have Susan in the area, then we may never get better and still keep our wallets! When a member of my family is sick, I know that I can rely on Susan Hunter and her family practice to give the care that is needed.
