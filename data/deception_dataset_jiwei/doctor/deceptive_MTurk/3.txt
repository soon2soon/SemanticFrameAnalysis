Doctor Aboolian is a rare breed of doctor. In my experience, he is the gold standard for doctors. He is calm and confident, focuses on using medicine to make life better, and can explain really complicated topics simply and openly. His clients are elite, and that's only fitting - Doctor Aboolian is about as elite as they come. Cosmetic surgery demands the best doctors and surgeons with the most experience and deepest intellect. They also have to understand what me, as a patient, feels from initial consultation to post-op. This doctor's worth it.
