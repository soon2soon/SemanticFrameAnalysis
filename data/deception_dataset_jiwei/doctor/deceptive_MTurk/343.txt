I had finally given up my search for a good doctor when I found Dr. Van Jaaraveldt. Practicing with the Lakewood Family Practice Center, I was able to get a quick appointment, and knew upon speaking with the receptionist I had found someone I was going to love. And I was right. This doctor, and his staff,are absolutely amazing. I did not have to wait one minue to see the doctor, and he was so professional and friendly. He took the time to answer all of my questions and seemed so eager to help me get better. There aren't a lot of doctors like that anymore. I feel comfortable and content with the doctor and his staff, as if I am the only patient in the office. It felt like sitting with old friends instead of at the doctor office. I also love the fact I was able to get an appointment so quickly, and the no wait. I have finally found the doctor of my dreams, and I am never going anywhere else again.
