Dr. Hassell has been an amazing help to me, he is an extremely well versed doctor whom I would recommend to all of my friends and family! After being passed from doctor to doctor, only Dr. Hassell was able to relieve my constant sinus symptoms. What I enjoy most about him is his holistic approach, his solutions aren't simply prescribing pills, unlike other doctors I have experienced in the past, he searches for the natural, healthy way to diagnose and treat. He is very friendly, kind, and patient, he took the time to listen to me and answered all of my questions knowledgeably. Thank you, Dr. Hassell!
