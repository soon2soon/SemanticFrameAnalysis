Dr. Desmond VanJaarsveldt has been a valued member of this medical community for many years. I have trusted him to provide medical care for my entire family, from the youngest child to my elderly parents. He is always professional and courteous and he never seems to mind taking the extra time to explain something I don't understand. He will make house calls if we are too sick to drive to the office but if we are at the office, he makes sure to remind us that the pharmacy which is part of their practice can fill our prescriptions quickly. I like that we don't have to drive all over town to have it filled. One other good point about this doctor and Four Rivers Medical practice is that they have extended hours, starting very early in the morning until late in the evening; in addition, they have a walk-in clinic for emergencies. I don't think I would trust a new graduate doctor with the health of my family anywhere near as much as I trust Dr. Van Jaarsveldt. He makes us feel as though he truly cares about us.
