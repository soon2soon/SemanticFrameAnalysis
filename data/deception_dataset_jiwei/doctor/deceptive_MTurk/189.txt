I had been suffering from wrinkles and sag lines on my face for a few years and have been self conscious about it since i got them. Finally, I had decided to see a doctor. I was referred to Dr. John Keller at Baywood Clinic by a friend and decided to check him out myself. When I went to see him the extremely friendly receptionist helped me fill out my paperwork and I was in the office with the doctor within 10 minutes. Dr. Keller listened to everything I had said with true interest. He seemed to really care about everything i had to say. We discussed my options and ended up choosing skin filler and botox. I went back 2 weeks later and had both operations done at the same time. My face looked exactly as it did when I was in my twenties. Dr. Keller did an unbelievable job and I recommend him to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery.
