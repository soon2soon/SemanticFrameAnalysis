I recently went in to see Doctor Greyvenstein. Overall, it was a very good visit. I arrived, and didn't have to wait to be checked in; I just talked to the receptionist, provided updated insurance information, and that was it. It was quick and easy. I then had to sit down and wait. But the waiting room was nice- it was quiet, peaceful, and well decorated. The chairs were comfortable, there were plenty of different magazines to read, and there weren't a lot of people there. Also good-I wasn't in the waiting room for very long. That's always the part that is the worst for me- when I get stuck in a waiting room for 30 minutes or more. But after only about 5 minutes, the nurse came through the door and asked me to come back.
