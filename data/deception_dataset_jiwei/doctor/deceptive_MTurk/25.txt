We are so thankful that we found Dr. Lurie as our family physician. He is wonderful with our children, and my partner and I feel comfortable with him as well. He is very knowledgeable, and was able to diagnose a chronic condition that several other doctors had missed previously. Great office, too - the staff is very friendly, the waiting area is good for families, and it is so convenient to have lab work and x-rays done in the same building. We could not be happier with Dr. Lurie.
