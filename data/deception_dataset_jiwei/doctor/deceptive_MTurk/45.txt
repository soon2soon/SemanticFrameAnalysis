When I first started looking for a cosmetic surgeon I visited a lot of doctor's offices looking for the right fit for me and I found Dr. Burke Robinson's office to be the most supportive and professional choice. I didn't really know what I wanted at the time, just that I wanted to look younger, and the staff there were so helpful in explaining what options I had and what surgeries they offered that I made the decision to get a facelift that very day. Once I had decided what to get, they put me at ease with the process and introduced me to Dr. Robinson. Dr. Robinson was very knowledgeable and explained everything step by step to me so that I knew what to expect. They also had great financing options as well so it made it very easy for me to pay in installments. After it was all said and done, he did a fantastic job on my face, making me look years younger. There really is no question in my mind where I would go if I need further work done in the future and I now tell all my friends considering getting a facelift to go to Dr. Robinson!
