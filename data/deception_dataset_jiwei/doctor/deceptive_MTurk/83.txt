Dr. Eric Bensimon is a very accomplished plastic surgeon. He is on the staff of Sacre-Coeur Hospital and he teaches at the University of Montreal, plastic surgery department. He has worked with Drs. Menard and Brassard since 2002, performing facial feminization surgery as well as plastic surgery and craniofacial surgery. He is an excellent doctor and has a wonderful bedside manner. I am very pleased with his work and would recommend him to anyone. He takes the time to listen to what your needs and concerns are.
