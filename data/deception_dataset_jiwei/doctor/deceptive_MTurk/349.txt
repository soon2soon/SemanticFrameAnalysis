I am a new patient of Dr. Healley and my first experience with him was amazing. I was referred to him by a good friend and I saw him for the first time when I got a bad case of the flu. When I arrived he called my name right on time, something I've never experienced with any kind of medical appointment. I found him to be attentive, knowledgeable, and caring. I could tell he truly wanted to help and he went out of his way to share a tips to get through this flu as comfortably as possible. Finally! A doctor who listened!
