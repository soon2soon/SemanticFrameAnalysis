Dr. Longnecker is my favorite doctor! His "bedside manner" is unparalleled, making me feel relaxed even in the sickest of states. He is efficient but not cold, which is perfect for me. He comes into the examination room, immediately performs the necessary tests and asks the necessary questions, and, once this is all said and done, he asks me about my family/job/etc. It's refreshing to have a doctor feel like he cares about you, especially in this day and age of managed care making doctors see more and more patients. I highly recommend going to see him for a pleasant experience!
