Dr. Ayling is a friendly, personable M.D. with a big smile and warm disposition. He makes going to the doctor's office a joy. He never keeps me waiting and really takes an interest in my health. Dr. Ayling likes to talk with his patients and really listens to my responses. His diagnoses are always on target. Highly recommended.
