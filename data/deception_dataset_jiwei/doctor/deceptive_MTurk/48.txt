I had been unhappy with the texture of my facial skin for a couple of years. I also was self-conscious about some uneven pigmentation and spotting that I had developed from sun exposure over the years. I am in my 40s and in great shape, my face just looked older than I felt. I found Dr. Robinson through the American Board of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. My primary care physician had told me the most important thing to look for when searching for a plastic surgeon is to make certain they are Board Certified in plastic surgery. I was very nervous when I went to my appointment, but Dr. Robinson quickly put me at ease once he came into the exam room. He looked at the areas on my face that bothered me and suggested a Laser Skin Resurfacing treatment, which he would be able to perform in his office. We discussed what the procedure would entail, and also what recovery would be like and what results I could realistically expect. I agreed that this course of treatment would best suit my needs and then met with the office manager to make my appointment and go over payment options. I returned a week later for my Laser Skin Resurfacing and the procedure was a bit uncomfortable, but not at all painful. I received numbing injections before the treatment and honestly that was the worst part. During the recovery period, I made certain to follow all of the post-procedure instructions exactly and at 10 weeks post-procedure, I am so pleased with my results. My skin is smoother, brighter and has an overall fresh look. I am very satisfied with the care I received from Dr. Robinson and plan to return to him in a few weeks to discuss facial filler injections.
