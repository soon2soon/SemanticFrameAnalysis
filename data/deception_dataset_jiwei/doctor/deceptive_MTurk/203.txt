I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Ali.I went to see her for my annual checkup. She is very smart and knows what she is talking about.Dr.Ali is also very patient, interested to hear you out and doesn't rush you just to get to her next appointment like most other doctors do. I'm for sure going back to see Dr.Ali
