Dr. Wolf is one of the most personable and thorough cosmetic surgeons I have hadthe pleasure of meeting and working with. In light of all the misconceptions about cosmetic surgeons, he is a welcome respite for patients who are not sure if they even need anything done. He lessens their fears and explains every option available to them. This practice as well has a very comforting feel so that even in the waiting room potential patients can relax and take a deep breath. Cosmetic surgery can make people nervous to contemplate but a place like Dr. Wolf's office is a place to relax and approach things calmly (which is a good change!). Were I to consider a cosmetic surgeon I would gladly see Dr. Wolf.
