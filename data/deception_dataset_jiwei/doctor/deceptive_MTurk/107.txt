I love this medical office. Issues such as these are so delicate and personal. Both my husband and I felt very comfortable to talk to this staff about our personal needs. I have some problems with unsightly varicose veins and my partner has a lot of hair removal needs. If you are looking for a tactful, confidential doctors office for such issues and want kind, attentive service, just visit the online website or make an appointment. You'll be glad you did.
