Both my daughter and I see Dr. Longnecker and I have never had a bad experience with him. After you sign in the wait time is rarely over 15 minutes, he is polite, clear speaking, and takes the time to explain everything to me. When my daughter had to go to the hospital Dr. Longnecker was the quarterback of the entire experience. He made sure that the hospital was ready for her admittance and oversaw every step taken. Additionally, I love that he is affiliated with St. Jude, it is exactly where I wanted my daughter to go. (OR if it needs to me more generic...) Dr. Longnecker is a great doctor who has gone the extra mile to not only treat my family and myself when we are sick but make sure we understand what is wrong and are up to date on preventative care. The office staff is friendly and organized. There are never appointment errors or long wait times. I completely trust my family to be in his care. 5 Stars.
