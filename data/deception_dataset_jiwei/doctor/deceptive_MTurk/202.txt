Dr. Karima Ali's in my opinion is one of the finest doctors in this professional. Her courteous, comprehensive and attentive approach to my medical needs have by far superceded the recommendation and the referral that I received from my colleague. Prior to my first visit with Dr. Ali I was a little dismayed in my success at finding a medical practitioner that came with an authentic and geniune bedside manner as well. Needless to say that I have found that and more in Dr. Ali. Not only is the Dr. one of the top professionals in this field,the innovative technology and exceptional customer service is par none. I highly recommend Dr. Ali for anyone in need of this specific medical support.
