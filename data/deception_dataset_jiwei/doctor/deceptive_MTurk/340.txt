My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Van Jaarsveldt for years. We received good, thorough care. More importantly, we have never had to wait for more than fifteen minutes to be seen. The doctor is prompt. The long wait-time was the reason we left our previous clinic. The nurses here are friendly, and overall we are very pleased with the care we receive.
