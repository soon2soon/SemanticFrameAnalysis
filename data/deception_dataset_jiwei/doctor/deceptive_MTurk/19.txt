Dr. Lurie is an exceptional physician with a successful practice. He has always been very very accommodating with his schedule whenever I need to visit with him on short notice. Dr. Lurie and his staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable with years of experience and offer good advice regarding my health. His office is warm and inviting unlike some doctor offices which helps to put me at ease the second I walk in the door. I know myself and my family are in good hands with Dr. Lurie.
