Based on recommendations from friends, I sought out Dr. Robert Wolf at Waters Edge for consultation on a tummy tuck procedure. Two abdominal surgeries had left me with an asymmetrical scar and lots of unattractive skin puckering. I was a bit nervous, but the office surroundings were so soothing! I loved the waterfall - very relaxing. I found Dr. Wolf to be extremely professional and highly compassionate. He discussed a number of options with me, and after our meeting I felt very confident in his ability to provide me with a good surgical outcome. I was very pleased with the results of my surgery. I feel like I'm bikini-worthy again and would not hesitate to consult Dr. Wolf again if I have future cosmetic surgery needs.
