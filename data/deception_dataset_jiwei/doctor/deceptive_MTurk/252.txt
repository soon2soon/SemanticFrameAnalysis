I went to this doctor about one month ago for a face lift. I am 45 years old, and the wrinkles on my face look absolutely horrible. After only 4 days of prep, the surgery was only 1.5 hours long, and extremely easy to undergo, no pain. The results were absolutely astonishing! I look about 15 years younger, and I am a lot more confident and happy with my life. Would definitely recommend Dr. Brassard!
