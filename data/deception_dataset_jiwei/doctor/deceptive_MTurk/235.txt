I visited Dr. Penelope Stalker and I was very satisfied with the way in which she took care of my medical problem. I have a rash on my elbows and she took the time to give me a thorough examination. She asked if I knew if I was allergic to any foods. Then, she prescribed an ointment that would take care of the problem after a few days of use. The most important part of the visit is that she actually took care of me and that I wasn't assigned to be seen by her assistant.
