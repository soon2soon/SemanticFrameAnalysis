I was very happy with the clinic and Dr. Martin Jugenberg. They all made me feel as if I was at home and didn't let the littlest thing pass without explaning it to me. After my surgery I was given after care notes in easy to understand even for my husband to understand. They also called the next couple days after surgery to make sure I was doing ok and if I have anymore questions. The best and wouldn't go any where else!
