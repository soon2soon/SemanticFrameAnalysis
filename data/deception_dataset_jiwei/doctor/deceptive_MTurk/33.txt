Dr. LeBlanc provided great service, with very little wait time. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist upon arrival and asked to fill out my paperwork. I was then taken to a patient waiting room within 5 minutes of returning my paperwork. Dr. LeBlanc came in within 5 minutes and took his time with me. He answered all of my questions, addressed my concerns and discussed what kind of results I could expect. He was thorough, respectful, and put me at ease. I high recommend Dr. LeBlanc!
