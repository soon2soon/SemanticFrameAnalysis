This review is regarding a Botox procedure at lakeview medical. I had been considering botox injections for a few years. I decided to drop by one day because I live in the area and would pass by the location. I'd never had any kind of cosmetic procedure before so I was a little nervous going in how it would work. Dr. Nave made my experience very pleasant, however. She explained the procedure to me in plain english and didn't make me feel uncomfortable whatsoever. It was quick, it was painless, and I am looking forward to my next appointment. I saw the results right away. Forehead wrinkles no more! I'm so grateful to Dr. Nave for helping me through my first experience with botox. Before I had always regarded it as unpleasant and not worth the money, but now that I've experienced it for myself and it was worth it!
