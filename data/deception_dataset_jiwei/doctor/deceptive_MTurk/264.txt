Dr. Davis is a wonderful physician! First, he came in on-time for the scheduled appointment. If you have had experiences like me, you know we usually wind up waiting 30min, 45min, and sometimes 1 hour for the doctor to actually come in for the appointment. Dr. Davis was on schedule. This impressed me, as it shows he has respect for my time. Meanwhile, from the moment he walked in I had his undivided attention. He was very attentive to my needs, and answered all my questions. He is very easy to talk to about your medical issues. I was also very impressed with his knowledge. Overall, Dr. Davis is exceeded my expectations!
