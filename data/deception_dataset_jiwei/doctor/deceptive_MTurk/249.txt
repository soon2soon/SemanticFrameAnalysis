I recently visited Dr. Brassard for an appointment. The office staff were very cordial with getting me in without having to wait for weeks. I was skeptical at first, but after I researched his resume, I felt comfortable in seeing him. Not only is he accredited with numerous affiliations and achievements, but he's also been a professor. He took the time to explain my options, risks, and current research. I felt that he was speaking "to me" and not "at me." One can always tell that someone enjoys their craft, once they decide to teach it to others. I would highly recommend him to family and friends.
