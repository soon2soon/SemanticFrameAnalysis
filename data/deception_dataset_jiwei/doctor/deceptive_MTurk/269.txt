He seems like he knows what he's doing. I know that many females seek plastic surgery due to low self-confidence. Dr. Davis would be a great doctor to turn to when needing a trusting doctor who knows what he's doing. When a doctor is dedicated to his work, that makes the patient more comfortable dealing with decisions involving that doctor. Dr. Davis is a prime example. Although I'm neutral in deciding whether or not plastic surgery is a good thing for people, sometimes getting plastic surgery gives some the confidence they need to get through the day. There are people who get made fun of and put down because of the way they look, and I'm sure, in some people's eyes, Dr. Davis is considered a hero. When you make someone feel from depressed to confident, it changes that person's whole world around. So thank you Dr. Davis. Plastic surgery is an option. Those who choose it probably thank you as well.
