My son and I are so happy with Dr. Mazza-Whelan. She is an absolute professional and a dream to visit! Her office is great, all the staff are so nice. And the waiting room has plenty of magazines and toys and a TV to keep the kids entertained. Everyone is so great with kids. My son is never exactly *happy* to go to the doctor, but he is never scared or upset in the office. Her office is part of a larger chain of physicians, but I honestly do not get any corporate vibes off of her practice. Dr. Mazza-Whelan herself is wonderful with kids. Whenever she examines my son, he never puts up a fuss or fight. He's never once cried or been scared. She has a very calming effect upon him. At other doctor's offices, he's cried when having his blood drawn. But Dr. Mazza-Whelan knows how upsetting this is for him, so she draws the blood herself instead of asking a nurse to do it. This has really helped to calm my son down. She listens to both his concerns and my concerns, and she's never led us astray in any treatments. She also gives out lots of free samples for the different drugs (especially nasal sprays) my son needs to help lower the costs for his medications. I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan, especially for younger kids!
