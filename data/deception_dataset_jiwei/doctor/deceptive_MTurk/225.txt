I had been searching for a great surgeon for some time now. I have always had that "beer gut." When I first contacted the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, I was greeted by one of the nicest women I had ever talked to. She made it easy for me to set up a consultation and I was in within the next few weeks. I was paired with doctor Martin Jugenburg. Wow! I was so excited when I met him and I felt extremely comfortable and at ease with him. My biggest concern was about safety and I told this to Dr. Jugenburg. He assured me that he was very experienced and has been doing this for a long time. Once before I had gone to a different clinic and had a consultation but decided against it after the doctor was very rude to me and the cost was out of my price range. When I talked with Dr. Jugenburg, I felt like I was chatting with an old friend. And when I heard the price, I was shocked! The price was fair and a lot less than anywhere in the surrounding area! I decided to get a tummy tuck and was set up with an appointment. I'm not going to lie; it takes some time to recover and you will be sore. However, I am extremely satisfied with my results and that "beer gut" is no more! I appreciated all of the help and kindness that Dr. Jugenburg and his staff have given me. I go back for a checkup in about two weeks and I cannot wait until I am able to go swimming and not think about if other people are staring at my stomach. I can't wait!
