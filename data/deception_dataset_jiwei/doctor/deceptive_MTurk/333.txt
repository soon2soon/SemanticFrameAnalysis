My experience with Dr. Wasserfall was absolutely fabulous. His demeanor and attitude were caring and helpful. He had a humor about him which helped ease any tension my family had about going to the doctor. Our youngest daughter had to get some vaccines and we were expecting a lot of tears, but Dr. Wasserfall was able to talk her through it (with the help of my wife and I, of course) and we left the office with tear-free MMR shots. I would recommend Dr. Wasserfall to ANYBODY!
