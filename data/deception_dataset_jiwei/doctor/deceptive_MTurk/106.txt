Dr. Luna is a great doctor. Not only does he help with my ailment and treat me, but he goes above and beyond to connect with me and make me comfortable. He always takes time to ask me about my life and asks about my grandchildren. The wait time is consistently less than 10 minutes. His support staff is very nice and professional. Even though he is a very popular doctor, he still works me in when I really need to be seen.
