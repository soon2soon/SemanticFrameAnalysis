Finding the right doctor is a very difficult process because not only do you need someone who does good work but you also need someone who you feel comfortable with. Dr. Richards is amazing! He made me feel 100% comfortable with him doing the procedure. He was very upfront and explain everything to me so that I could understand what was going to happen. I also appreciated the fact that he gave me his honest opinion so that I would not end up having something done that would leave me looking a mess. After having everything done I'm 200% satisfied with the results and I will never go to another doctor.
