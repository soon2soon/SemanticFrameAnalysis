I had an excellent experience with Dr. Francois Lacombe at the Polyclinique Medicale Concorde. It has been a delight working with him during the births of my children. He has a wonderful bedside manner, good hours, and an excellent network of referral services when he is unavailable. For those seeking an obstetrician in the Montreal-Laval area, I would highly recommend Dr. Lacombe.
