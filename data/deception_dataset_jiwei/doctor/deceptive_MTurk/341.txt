 When it comes to my family's health and well being, I trust the doctors at the Four Rivers Medical Clinic. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt is a well qualified member of the staff that I recently saw during my latest check-up visit. A very knowledgeable and friendly gentleman, Desmond Van Jaarsveldt is a excellent source of medical advice and easy to talk to. His warm, friendly nature makes you comfortable in his office, and he seems genuinely concerned for my family's well being. I recommend him to anyone looking for a good family medicine practitioner.
