I recently underwent a rhinoplasty performed under the expert care of Dr. Eric Bensimon, after having lived with breathing problems for years after a broken nose that never healed properly. I was initially apprehensive about having such a procedure done, but after having my first consultation with Dr. Bensimon I knew I would be in good hands. Dr. Bensimon has a wonderful bedside manner to make his patients feel at ease, especially important to me when you're considering such a serious procedure as facial reconstructive surgery. And he has the knowledge and expertise to leave you feeling confident that you made the best choice. I never regretted for a moment that I chose Dr. Bensimon and the team at Montreal Plastic Surgery.
