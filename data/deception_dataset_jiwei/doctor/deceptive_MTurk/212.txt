Dr. Mausner and his staff are fantastic! They offered the best customer service I've ever received from a doctor's office. From scheduling my appointment to pre-op procedures to the day of the surgery everything was handled in the most professional manner. I was referred by a friend and will definitely be recommending his practice to all my friends and family. His work is impeccable! No one knew I had the surgery done! Dr. Mausner communicated every detail of my surgery with an unmatched bedside manner. His talent as a surgeon plus his clean, well run practice is what will keep me and my family coming back for generations to come!
