I visited Dr. Sheina Macadam to see what my options were following a rather massive weight loss. I was happy to be so much thinner but my main goal, to be able to show off my new body, was impossible with all of the loose skin. Dr. Macadam assured me that abdominoplasty could solve my problem. Fast forward a month and I am very pleased with the results. It took me a week or so to get back to my normal routine but I think the results will allow me to actually visit the beach this year without a shirt on. I haven't done that since high school so it will be a huge life change for me. I am pleased with the results. I also want to throw in a little extra credit for Dr. Macadam's personal skills. She made me feel at ease from the very beginning and this pleasant "bedside manner" helped me get through the process with some confidence.
