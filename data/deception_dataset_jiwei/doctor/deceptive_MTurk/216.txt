No complaints at all. Going into a doctor's office isn't the most comfortable experience in the world for me, but Dr. Mausner made me the most comfortable I could possibly be. He was friendly, knew what he was talking about, and I felt that he truely cared about me. If any of my friends needed work done, I would definently point them towards Dr. Mausner's direction.
