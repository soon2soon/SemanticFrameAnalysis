I recently went in to see Dr. Lurie at the Courtice Health Center because I was having issues with flu-like symptoms. Upon entering the office an assistant greeted me warmly and asked me my name. After a short 5 minute wait I was escorted through the well lit office and into a room where the nurse checked my height and weight. 10 minutes later Dr. Lurie entered the room and asked me what my issues were. He warmly asked questions with great concern, making me feel more at ease. I told him my symptoms included a slight fever, sore throat, vomiting, headache and an aversion to light. He took a swab to get a bacterial sample to determine what my sickness was. After that I left the doctors office for the day and the assistant told me they would call me in the morning to determine what was wrong with me. Total time at the doctors office was an amazing 30 minutes! The next day the Dr. Lurie called me personally and told me that I had a case of strep throat and he was going to put me on a series of antibiotics. He also stated that he'd just call the prescription into the nearest pharmacy and that I could pick it up at any time. Later that day I went to the pharmacy and picked up my meds, followed the instructions on the label and now 5 days later I'm fit as a fiddle! Thank you dr. Lurie, you're the best!
