I actually do not know where to begin, doctor Bensimon helped me with a very hard situation. I had a car accident and I was badly injured, I was not to worry about my body because I knew those were not going to affect me too much but there were one in my face that was going to let a pretty ugly scar which I did not like. A friend told me about doctor Eric Bensimon, he told me these great things that I could not believe but once I met him I realized that my friend was not exaggerating, he was the most kind since the beginning, he explained me the whole proccess and calmed my nerves about the entire thing, actually he was very pacient because I asked him so many things and he took the time to answer me. Now after the surgery I look even better, no side effects or anything, it took me like two months for the surgery pain to disappear but I dont have to worry about an ugly scar on my face, doctro Bensimon selfdemanding excellence what proofed me that he is the best.
