My 11 year old son had a fever, and cough that was keeping him up all night. I took him to see Dr. Desmond Van Jaarsveldt at Four Rivers Medical Group. While children are always getting sick, it is still every parent's nightmare and the worry and stress that something might really be wrong this time, always weighs on one's heart. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt was able to make me and my son feel at easy with his professional manner and confidence. It wasn't a big deal, but sometimes, you just need to feel sure that everything is ok. Thank you Dr. Van Jaarsveldt.
