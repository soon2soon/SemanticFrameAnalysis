Fernando Luna is a godsend. The varicose veins I have are not hurting like they once did. This is truly a gift to me. His practices in medicine are outstanding. I would recommend Fernando Luna to anyone. I was told he is in practice for nearly 30 years. He knows his stuff for sure. I am not one to really write reviews on the computer but I had to this time. I wanted to make sure that everyone who sees this will not hesitate to see Fernando Luna whenever possible. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
