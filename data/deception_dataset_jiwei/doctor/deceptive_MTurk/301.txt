After visiting Dr. Sheina Macadam's office I feel very confident in choosing her as my cosmetic surgeon. She was very honest in going over my options and just as honest in what wouldn't be an option for me. She told me both the pro's and the con's and we discussed what I would most comfortable with and what would be most beneficial. While going over the different surgical options she made sure I was aware of possible side effects, infections etc and explained to me post-surgical care. I am sure to recommend Dr. Shaina Macadams to anyone.
