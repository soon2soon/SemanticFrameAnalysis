Lakeside Medical Clinic has given me the best experience from beginning to end and continues to only impress me. As a full family practice they have covered everything from times when I've felt under the weather at a moments notice to my regular yearly health visits. Their website is one of the best and easy to navigate. I can make appointments online, or call in and be helped by one of their helpful staff. Dr Georgina Barnardo is my doctor and I can only say she is incredible. She promptly sees me when I get there for my appointment and calmly listens to anything I have to say, whether its my yearly check up or a special visit when I'm feeling sick. There is no sense of rush even though there are always other patients to see and she is very good at answering any amount of questions I have bout my health or results. She is the model doctor we all wish for when we walk into a doctors office, she is personable while being professional and her staff is kind as well. Dr. Barnardo is someone I would highy reccommend to all my friends and family because I know that whether they have an emergency, need ob-gyn visit or other common medical needs the doctor will take care of them in her practice. Im confident of that and hopefully you get to experience the calm I do when visiting her office.
