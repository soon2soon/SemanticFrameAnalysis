Dr Greyvenstein was able to see me as a same day appointment. I had woken up with a strange rash on my chest and needed it checked out. He was very caring and listened to all my concerns. He was also very thorough in his diagnosis and took the time to make sure he was providing the right medication and understood what type of rash I had. He explained everything to me in detail and did not leave untill I fully understood what I needed to do when I got home for treatment. I was really impressed with Dr Greyvenstein. I will definitely be seeing him again and suggest you do as well!
