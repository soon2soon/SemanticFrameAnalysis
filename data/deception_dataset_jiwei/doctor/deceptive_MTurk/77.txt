I normally do not write recommendations however after going to Dr. Tarnows office I felt compelled to write one. His staff is second to none. They made me feel comfortable with the procedure I was having done. Dr. Taranow's bedside manner coupled with his expertise in cosmetic surgery allowed me to be at ease. The work Dr. Taranow performed was excellent and I would recommend him to everyone.
