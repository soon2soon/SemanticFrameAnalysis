After having twins, my varicose veins were really visible and ugly, I'm only in my twenties and had to wear heavy stockings to cover them, even in the summertime. I made an appointment and went to go see Dr. Luna, because a friend said he helped her mom. I was really nervous that the injections would hurt, but they didn't! Dr. Luna was very kind, professional and answered all of my questions. Several treatments later, I'm out of my stockings and hope to be wearing shorts again this summer. I highly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone suffering from ugly veins that make you ashamed to be seen in public.
