My family and I have been going to Westcoast for a few years now. So far our experience has been exceptional. WHen our 4 year old son came down with the Flu Dr. Ayling happened to be the Doctor on call that night. Since it was after hours we thought we would have to go to the hospital, but Dr. Ayling made himself available to help our son out. We are greatful to have a family practice that cares about its community and patients. We definatly are greatful for not having to spend the night in the E.R. Thanks again Dr. Ayling and the rest of the staff at Westcoast!
