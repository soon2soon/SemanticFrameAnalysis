Dr. Bensimon was great! I was really skeptical about getting any form of cosmetic surgery at first, but decided to get a consultation at the urging of a friend. Dr. Bensimon answered all my questions and didn't try to push my fears aside. By the time I finished speaking with him, I felt completely comfortable about the procedures and didn't feel like I was jumping into something I didn't understand. Dr. Bensimon was clearly knowledgeable about the subject and had a great bedside manner. Highly recommended for all your cosmetic surgery needs!
