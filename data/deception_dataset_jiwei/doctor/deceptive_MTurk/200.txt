I went to The Doctors Office for the first time last week, and I was very pleased with the way my husband and I were treated, from the moment we stepped into the reception area all the way through the visit. We saw Dr. Karima Ali, and she was very patient with us. She explained that some additional tests were needed but she had someone verify that our insurance would cover them before we left. We will definitely continue to see her in the future.
