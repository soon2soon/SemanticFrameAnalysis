Over the last few years I became aware of excess skin and fat accumulation above my eyelids. I felt awkward at times feeling that others were not looking directly at me but instead my eyelids. One of my friends recommended that I visit Doctor Sheina Macadam. My friend confided in me that she had cosmetic surgery performed for the exact same issue a couple of years earlier and was very happy with the results. So following her recommendation I made an appointment to see Doctor Macadam. Initially I felt awkward and unsure talking about cosmetic surgery. Doctor Macadam was very open, friendly and patient in explaining what she could offer to help. She didn't rush the consultation and explained what my options were. I decided to have a blepharoplasty (the medical term for the procedure to reduce unwanted fat and skin hanging above the eyelids) performed. I was fully informed before the operation what to expect immediately after the surgery was completed. My surgery lasted only a couple of hours and I was able to return home the same day. I had no complications or surprises. Thanks to the skills of Doctor Sheina Macadam and her professional staff, my eyelids now look like I used to when I was younger. I no longer feel awkward about how I look and feel. I would recommend Doctor Sheina Macadam to anyone who wishes to look and feel better about themselves.
