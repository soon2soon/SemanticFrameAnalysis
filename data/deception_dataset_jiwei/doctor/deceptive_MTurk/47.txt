I've used Dr. Burke P. Robinson as my primary care physician for two years and have received excellent care. I have multiple health conditions, and one (acid reflux) makes it difficult to treat anything else, as a lot of ordinary medications mess up my stomach. He's done a great job managing all of it and is as personable as he is knowledgeable. Dr. Burke P. Robinson spends a lot of time answering questions, and although he is very tightly scheduled, will always make room for a sick or injured patient. He is also generally quite punctual. He also has filled out various forms for work and sports quickly. Five stars for his treatment. Dr. Burke P. Robinson genuinely is accepting new patients at the moment -- He's so well liked that her current patients keep referring new ones, which is how I found him in the first place. I have PPO insurance and it's never been an issue. His practice gets another star because of the staff -- I've had excellent experiences. The staff has always been courteous, though, and one of hisr staff has done a bunch of wrangling with my insurance company and mail-in pharmacy to get me my medication.
