i have been a patient with Dr. Russell Albak for 15 years now. I am thankful to have found such a caring family physican. He delivered both of my children and continues to care for them in their teens. The hours are convinent. The open clinic hours are so convient. My youngest child was diagnoised with diabetes. we have gotten state of the art treatment for him. There is a nutritionist that Dr Russell Albak set us up with. MAking a difficult condition manageable. he got my little boy a special book to expalin diabetes to him. It is extremely important that they have onsite labs. Dr Russell Albak was kind of enough to instruct that I needed a butterfly ne edle when I get my blood drawn because my vein rolled. It cured a life long fear of needles. Dr. Russell Albak takes the time to talk to me not at me.
