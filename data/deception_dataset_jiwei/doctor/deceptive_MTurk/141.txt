Dr. Barnardo is wonderful and a true professional! The entire office staff is pure class and from the moment you walk into the office you feel like you are at home. It is very clean and welcoming and makes you feel like you made the right decision. The equipment is completely state of the art and I have never had an issue with something not working properly. She so is friendly and goes out of her way to make you feel like you are the center of attention. I sometimes have trouble asking the right questions but Dr. Barnardo has no problem talking with me about my ailment and making sure I have a full understanding of what is going on and what the next steps are. She will wait all day and make sure that we are ready to move forward. She makes me feel like I am a member of her own family.
