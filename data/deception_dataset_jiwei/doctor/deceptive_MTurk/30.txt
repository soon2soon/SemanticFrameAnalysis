Dr. LeBlanc is a truly caring cosmetic surgeon. I consulted with him to improve myself, and he was there for me every step of the way. Not only were the results of my surgery fantastic, but the atmosphere and the interest Dr. LeBlanc took in me were phenomenal. The best part of the whole experience was that Dr. LeBlanc communicated with me at every step of the process: before, during and after the surgery. I would highly recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery.
