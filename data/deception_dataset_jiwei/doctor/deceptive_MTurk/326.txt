When I first met Dr. Jablonski, I was very unsure about what to expect for my family. I was scared at the idea of a new doctor that may not understand my personal needs or the needs of my children. But, he made me feel right at home, like I was visiting with a neighbor. He helped me to feel comfortable with myself and take charge of a healthier, more positive lifestyle, and showed me ways that I can teach my children to be healthier, too. Dr. Jablonski helped me gain control of my daily stress and gain a true sense of wellness. We went over my eating and sleeping habits together, discussing what was healthy and conducive to my busy life at the same time. I have made some very giant steps towards leading a healthy lifestyle for myself and my family, and I have Dr. Ted Jablonski to thank for that!
