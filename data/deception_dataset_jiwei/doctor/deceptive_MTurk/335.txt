When I walk into the office, I was greeted with an unexpectedly warm smile and a how are you from the receptionist. I have a sincere talk with the receptionists and am quickly seen by Dr. Wasserful. He is informative and helpful, and tells me all my options and gives me an unbiased analysis of my options. I am treated quickly and out of the office in a jiffy. This is a great practice, with great service and consistent treatment. Thank You, Dr. wasserful.
