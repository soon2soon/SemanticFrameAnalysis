Dr. Kriegler seems provides her patients with the same compassion and understanding that she would provide her own family members with. Her educational background and long years of experience are totally impressive. She always makes me feel that I am her top priority and is extremely compassionate and non-judgemental. In my past, I've had doctors who made me feel either like a number, or like an idiot, or both, but not Dr. Kriegler. She is a very good listener and always takes the time to answer my questions. While sometimes, I do have to wait a little bit longer than I'd like, my previous experience as her patient always makes it more acceptable to me than it has been with other doctors because I know how thorough she is and how she takes the time to be certain that any issue I might have will be addressed.
