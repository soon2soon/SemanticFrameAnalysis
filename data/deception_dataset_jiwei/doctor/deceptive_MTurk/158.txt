What more can I say, I love Dr. Silverman! He gave me my confidence back and I couldn't be more grateful for this talented and kind doctor! After losing a significant amount of weight, my breasts became saggy and lifeless. I kept thinking about cosmetic surgery but the process was so overwhelming. I wanted a doctor who was exceptionally talented but also someone who would really listen to me. It wasn't until I heard a glowing review of Dr. Silverman from a coworker that I knew that this was the time to seize my opportunity. From the moment I walked into his office, all the way to the follow-up sessions after my breast lift, I felt at ease. Dr. Silverman's credentials are impeccable (he even has hospital privileges at top hospitals) and getting to see photos of his work really eased my mind. He was extremely honest with me about what I could expect from the surgery and how long the recovery time would be. This was the best decision I have ever maid for myself. If you're thinking about cosmetic surgery and you want a talented and caring doctor, you owe it to yourself to look into Dr. Silverman. I hope this review helped!
