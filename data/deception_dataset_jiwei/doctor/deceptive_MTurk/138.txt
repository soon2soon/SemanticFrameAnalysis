Dr. Georgina Barnardo at the Lakeside Medical Clinic has been my doctor for three years now. I have constantly been impressed with her professionalism, but also her attention to detail and her ability to remember small details about my life that make everything feel personalized. She takes time to listen to my concerns and never makes me feel as though they are unwarranted. Often, she gives me extra health tips throughout my visit, usually tips I would have never otherwise thought about! She usually responds to my calls within the hour and doesn't ever seem to be in a hurry or that my call isn't worth her time. I have been very pleased with Dr. Barnardo and would recommend her to anyone.
