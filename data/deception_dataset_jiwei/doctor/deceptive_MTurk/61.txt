Our daughter was born with a cleft palate. Dr. Forrest and the SIck Kids Foundation were recommended by our family practitioner. Dr. Forrest reassured us and outlined the entire treatment plan. He oversaw the procedure and provided clear step by step recovery instructions. He and his staff gave our whole family great attention during this ordeal. We are truly grateful.
