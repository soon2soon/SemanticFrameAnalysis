I am new to the area so I have been looking for a new doctor. I got several recommendations to try Dr. Barnardo at Lakeside Medical Clinic. That was a great suggestion! Dr. Barnardo is very smart. He did not rush me through my visit. He answered all my questions. His staff was very friendly. The office was clean. I spent less than 5 minutes waiting for my appointment. Even my wife liked the doctor and she really does not like doctors! I will be going to this office from now on.
