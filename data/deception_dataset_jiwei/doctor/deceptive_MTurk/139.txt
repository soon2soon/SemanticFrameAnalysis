I had acquired this horrible cough that lasted over a month. I had tried all of the OTC medicine that was available. I thought my cough was getting better until one night when I couldn't breathe well. I saw an ad for Lakeside Medical Clinic the day before and saw that they accepted walk-in's. I rushed over there and received a fast response to my problem. Doctor Barnardo was assigned to me and quickly did the required tests to diagnose my condition. Dr. Barnardo was very polite and skilled at what she was doing. Let's just say that I stopped coughing and have never felt better!
