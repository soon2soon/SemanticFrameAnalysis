Doctor Eric Bensimon might be my favorite doctor ive been to. I saw him after i hurt my wrist and he quickly figured out that it was just sprained and not broken. He perscribed some pain pills and a 2 week session of therapy for it. My wrist now feels perfect. He was also very nice and curtious person. I would highly reccomend him.
