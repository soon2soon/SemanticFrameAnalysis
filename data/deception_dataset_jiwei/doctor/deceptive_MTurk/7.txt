Dr. Aboolian is a miracle worker, he has given me the power to redeem my self esteem. I was in a terrible automobile accident 2 years ago, and was left with signficant scaring on the left side of my face. Dr. Aboolian was recommended by my primary care physician after all other injuries had healed. During my initial consultation; Dr.Aboolian, put my fears to rest; I would not be disfigured for life. He was upfront and honest with me; I would need to undergo several surgeries and there would be brusing and swelling after each. He has rebuilt my nose and jaw line, grafted new skin on my left check, and repaired a prior facial scar. I look better than my old self again. Dr. Aboolian is my savior. I recommend him and his staff to anyone needing considerable cosmetic repair, or just a nip here and a tuck there.
