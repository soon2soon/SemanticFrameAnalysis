Dr. forrest is a fantastic pediatritian. He goes out of his way to make it fun for the kids and be their friends. He is very through in eliminating every possible way my son was feeling ill to determine the reason, and make sure it wasnt anything serious. Dr. Forrest is the kind of doctor that remembers the name of you and your family without having to look at a chart. He is a shining example of what a doctor should be and an honor to the profession.
