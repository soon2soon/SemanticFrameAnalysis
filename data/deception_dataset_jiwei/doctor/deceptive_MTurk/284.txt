Dr. Wolf and his staff were very welcoming and professional, from the very first time I called to make and appointment. During my consultation, Dr. Wolf took the time to listen to my questions and concerns and provided honest, thoughtful and helpful answers. I did not feel rushed or pressured, and it seemed like he really wanted to make sure I made the best decision to suit my body type and my needs. He showed me plenty of before and after photos to give me a realistic idea of what my outcome could be and really put me at ease. He was also able to do my botox injection in the same visit, which he did quickly and expertly. I can't wait to schedule my surgery with Dr. Wolf!
