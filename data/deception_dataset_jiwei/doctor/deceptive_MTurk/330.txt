When I went to Dr. Tinus Wasserfall's practice last month, I was pleasantly surprised. The waiting room was very clean and neat. It was very appeasing to the eye. The receptionists were especially friendly and helpful. It was not very difficult to get an appointment with him, as it is with many family care doctors. When I got back to the care room, Dr. Wasserfall was very professional. He made sure that all my concerns were addressed and was very friendly. He even made an effort to connect with me as a person instead of just writing me off as a patient like many other doctors I have visited in the past. I would definitely recommend Dr. Wasserfall to anyone that is searching for a friendly, professional and overall wonderful family care doctor.
