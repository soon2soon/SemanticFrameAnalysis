Dr. Martin Jugenburg and his team performed my nose surgery procedure (rhinoplasty). I could not be happier with the results. Dr. Jugenberg sat with me and explained the procedure and also showed me "before and after" photos from his previous patients. I felt at ease speaking with him and he had a warm personality. He asked a lot of questions regarding what I had in mind in terms of the final appearance of my nose. He made sure that my expectations were realistic but he also seemed confident that I would end up happy. During the recovery time, the doctor or his nurse would call to check up on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Dr. Jugenberg seems very professional and knowledgeable in the field of cosmetic surgery. I would recommend him to anyone looking for plastic or reconstructive surgery, and I am thrilled with the results.
