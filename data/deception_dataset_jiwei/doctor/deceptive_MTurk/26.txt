Dr. Arnold Lurie has been my doctor years. He exhibits the best professional attitude that a patient could ask for. He's thorough and accurate. I never have to wait an unreasonable amount of time, and the office is always extremely clean. His staff is warm and welcoming. When I am there, I have his attention 100% of the time. That is very difficult to find in any doctor these days. I highly recommend Dr. Lurie.
