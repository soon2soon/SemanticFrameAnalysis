"Experience Matters" is how I would describe my results overall in completing a face lift through the office of Doctor Howard Silverman of Ottawa. I did a lot of reading and research in making my decision to take the risk of having a face lift. Once I decided that I would have the procedure done, I had to do a good deal more research in selecting a doctor and practice to perform my surgery. It is true that your results ARE only as good as the skill that the doctor has in performing the surgery itself. I carefully reviewed Dr. Silverman's qualifications and references, I read his patient referrals, spoke with past patients and looked at his before and after results. I also took into account the number of years he has been performing surgeries and the number of face lift procedures he has performed. After considering all this information, the decision for me to use Dr. Howard Silverman to perform my surgery was easy. I am very pleased with my results. The after care I received following the surgery was excellent and helped make my results the best they could be.
