I've looked all across California for a good family practice that cares for the individual. My family and I have had previous problems with other facilities in the past. A friend recommended Dr. Longnecker, I took my youngest in for a routine checkup and the service and care was expenential. I've recommended to my friends and there experiances seem very much like mine professional, quick, and with great care.
