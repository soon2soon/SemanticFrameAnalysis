Dr. Arnold Lurie has had much experience in the medical field and I feel very comfortable taking myself and my family to him for any reason. In my opinion, the best thing about seeing Dr. Lurie is that the appointments are very flexible and easy to schedule and the wait time is minimal. I have never had a better experience when it comes to a doctor.
