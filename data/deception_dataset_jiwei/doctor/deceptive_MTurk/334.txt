I just moved to the area and was looking for a doctor to help me get rid of a terrible cough I'd had for weeks. A friend recommended Spectrum Health. Since they were in my insurance network and Dr. Wasserfall was accepting new patients, I decided to give them a try. Dr. Wasserfall turned out to be one of the kindest, most intelligent doctors I've ever been to. He took the time to listen carefully to all of my symptoms. After a thorough examination he recommended allergy medicine! I was so shocked; I've never suffered from allergies in my life. Turns out he was right and my cough went away almost instantly. Very glad that I stumbled on this practice. I will be sure to try Dr. Wasserfall again next time I'm sick (which I hope won't be for a long time). My only complaint about Spectrum Health is that their URL tries to open an email program instead of going to a website!
