I could not be happier with my visit to The Baywood Clinic. Years of fear kept me from even thinking about getting Botox done, but as the lines in my face became deeper, I knew it was a matter of saving my self-esteem. My consultation with Dr. John Keller really put me at ease; what a wonderful and patient professional! Even though he is certified as an Advanced Botox Injector, he was very honest about the procedure and my concerns; he warned me that pain really does vary from one person to the next and was up front about the side-effects that may (but rarely do) occur. I really appreciated this and in the end, asked him to do my treatments. I am so grateful to Dr. Keller; everything turned out beautifully and I am scheduled for another session in 7 months!
