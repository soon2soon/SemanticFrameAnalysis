I called to make an appointment with Dr. Luna to see him for my vericose veins and was able to get in within one week. After arriving, I was taken back to his examining room within 15 minutes. I only had to wait another 15 minutes for him to arrive in the room. Dr. Luna very clearly explained the process I would undergo and all of the alternatives. He told me what to expect before, during, and after and patiently answered my questions. I would definetly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone!
