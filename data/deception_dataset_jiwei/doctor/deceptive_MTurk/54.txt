I recently visited Dr. Burke P. Robinson for treatment. From the time I entered the practice I immediately felt the ambiance of a highly professional environment. My nerves were calmed by the tender care and precision of the staff. Following the procedure, my expectations of the results were exceeded. If you are thinking about having a procedure done, I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson as my physician of choice.
