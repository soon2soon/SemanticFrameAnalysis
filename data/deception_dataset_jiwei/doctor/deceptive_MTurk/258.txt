I am not one to normally write a review. But I want to let you know about Dr. Rafik Bechbache, my families truly gifted doctor. As our family physician he has gone out of his way to provide superior service, he has been available at all times of the day and night, and has accurately diagnosed and treated our families' sicknesses and illnesses for the time we have known him. Supported by the quality staff at Markham Stouffville Hospital I don't know what we did before he was our doctor. He has certainly improved my life and the lives of my family. Thanks Doctor Bechbache.
