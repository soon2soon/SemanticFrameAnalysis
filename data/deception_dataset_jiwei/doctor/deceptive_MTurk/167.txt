The practice in which Dr. Kriegler works in is wonderful. This practice focuses on patient care and keep hours that are convenient for patients. They are open late during the week and opened on weekends as well as holiday's. The practice also offers new digital x-ray at the facility, and a lab so you can get many of your needs taken care of at one place. The urgent care can see many of your ailment's keeping you from spending long hours at the emergency room. Dr. Kriegler is wonderful and has great bedside manner, which is important for many people. I would recommend this practice and Dr. Kriegler to any of my family and friends, or anyone who is looking for a great place.
