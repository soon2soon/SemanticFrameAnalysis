My experience with Dr. Leblanc last Thursday was perfect. I was greeted with a smiling face and the lobby was welcoming. The publications were current and the wait was seemingly non-existent. Dr. LeBlanc was extremely professional and knowledgeable. My questions were answered in full and I did not feel rushed. I will absolutely trust my care and beauty in the hands Dr. Leblanc.
