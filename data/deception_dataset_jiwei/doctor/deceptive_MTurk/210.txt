Dr. Mark Mausner is a lovely man. Both my mother and my aunt got nose jobs at his office, and let me tell you, they look stunning. He is a true artist working in the medium that is the human body. In addition to his skill in the field, his office and staff are always very accommodating. The facility is top notch with cutting-edge medical technology -- it just goes to show how professional and truly caring Dr. Mausner is. The staff are always there to help and lend an ear when you need to vent. Having been in and out of the office because of my family members, I have to say that getting surgery there must be a truly remarkable experience.
