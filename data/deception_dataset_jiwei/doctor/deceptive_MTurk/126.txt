Doctor Francois Viviers's office was impeccable. I used to have strokes that would occur within days or months. I was always afraid when one would occur and if it would happen when no one was around. Sometimes I thought I could die within that week because my stress would get so high. Luckily someone recommended me to Doctor Vivier. He was able to give me the name of someone who would show me the right foods to eat to prevent another stroke from happening in the near future as well as lay out all the risk factors for me. Some of which I knew, but most that I had never even dreamed possible. He showed me how to also add multiple applications into my phone that can give me basic information or help. If you have a family member or are in need of someone ASAP then I suggest you call this man! He was so kind and helpful.
