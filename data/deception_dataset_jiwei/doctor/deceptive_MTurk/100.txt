I'll be honest, when I was first looking for doctors for cosmetic surgery i was a bit nervous. I have always wanted to have a breast enlargement. I thought that they would judge and laugh at me. I was also worried about the cost. But one day while talking to a coworker of mine about cosmetic surgery, she told me that she knew a friend who knows a surgeon who she swears by. I was a little reluctant when I made the appointment call and first talked to the receptionist. As I kept talking to her and asking her questions I felt more and more comfortable with this office. So then I scheduled an appointment for the next day and went into the office. I was called in the room almost immediately and then met Dr. Luna. He was the nicest person I have ever met in my life, no joke. He was so easy to talk to and answered all my silly questions and calmed my worries. We also discussed payment options that lets me make low monthly payments that I can afford. And then let me tell you, the surgery was a big success! I look fabulous and would have gone through this whole experience again. I would like to give a BIG thanks to Dr. Luna and Lola (the receptionist) for all their help. I would recommend Dr. Luna to anyone who wants or is even considering cosmetic surgery. He is THE best!
