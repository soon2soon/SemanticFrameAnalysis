Dr. Silverman and his staff were nothing short of fantastic. From the moment I entered their office for my consultation appointment, I felt comfortable and at ease. I was a little hesitant to meet with a plastic surgeon regarding elective surgery, but I'm so glad I did. He answered all my questions in a profession manner and never once did I feel pressured into making a snap decision. I would recommend anyone considering elective plastic surgery to meet with Dr. Silverman before choosing a doctor.
