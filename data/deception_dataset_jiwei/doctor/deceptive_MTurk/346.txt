Doctor Van Jaarsveldt of Four Rivers Medical Clinic was phenomenal. He looked at my son's swollen knee and was immediately able to treat the issue. He said that the bruise was nothing more than the result of a bike fall. (We assumed this, but we worried it was worse, for the bruise was so large). Dr. Jaarsveldt provided us with fast and simple coverage. He made sure we had all of our questions answered. Four Rivers Medical Clinic is the place to go if you want fast, affordable, and easy answers to your medical problems.
