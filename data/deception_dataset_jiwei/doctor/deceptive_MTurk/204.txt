I went to the doctor today and saw Dr. Karima Ali.The office was busy,many people waiting.My wait time was minimal,no sooner that I signed in,they were calling my name.The doctor smiled when he talked and was friendly.He complemented on my blouse that I was wearing.When I told the doctor my problem,he was very concerned and he asked many questions and covered all the bases.And turns out that his diagnosis was correct.The medicine I took cured my problem.This is the best complete experience that I have ever had with a doctor.I will keep him as my regular doctor.
