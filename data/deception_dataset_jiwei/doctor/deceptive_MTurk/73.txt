When I first decided to get body contouring, I knew that wanted to see Dr. Taranow. He has been recommended to me by numerous friends for his breast augmentation and body contouring work. Initially I checked out his website, I was able to look through numerous galleries to see more examples of his work. I decided to set my appointment for a liposuction, and I was very pleased with the outcome. His office and staff were very inviting, and he seemed to be very knowledgeable about the procedure. The surgery went very well. I have now fully recovered and I look great! I would definitely recommend Dr. Taranow to anyone looking for a great plastic surgeon.
