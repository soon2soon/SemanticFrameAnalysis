Two weeks ago, Dr. Mark Mausner changed my life forever. I had Blepharoplasty and Restalyn injections for the first time. I can not believe how amazing I look! Dr. Mark Mausner was recommended to me by my sister who had the same procedure done and looked at least 7 years younger. I must admit I think he did an even better job on me. Dr. Mark Mausner was so comforting and reassuring about both the procedure and its results. He understood how my face was affecting how I felt about myself and took time in the initial consultation to help me develop a yearly schedule to keep my looks fresh and keep the cost affordable. His office staff is professional and friendly, and never waited longer than 16 minutes to see him. I would highly recommend Dr. Mark Mausner to anyone who is looking for a knowledgeable, skilled Plastic Surgeon who truly cares about his patients and wants to develop a long term relationship.
