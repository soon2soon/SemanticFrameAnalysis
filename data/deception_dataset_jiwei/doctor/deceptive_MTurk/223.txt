After having my son, my body was just not what it used to be. Months of dieting and exercise improved my figure, but there were some things I just couldn't fix on my own - extra skin, sagging breasts. After doing some careful research I chose to go in for a consultation with Dr. Martin Jugenburg. Once I met him and his friendly staff I knew this was the place for me to complete my transformation! I had a tummy tuck and lipo with fantastic results, and I WILL be returning to have my breasts enhanced in the future. Ladies - Just go in and meet with him! You won't want go to anywhere else once you do.
