John Hasell five star review. I went in to see DR John Hasell, I have never seen him befor today and how impressed was I when I walked in to his office. I have heard good things about DR John Hasell and also have heard that he sees people for cosmetic surgery, we wont go in to detail on what I had to see DR John Hasell for but what a great doctor to see. The staff was very friendly and helpful, I got right in to see the doctor even being a new patient there, to my amazement he was able to answer all of my questions he did not rush me out the door to get the next paying patient in there, he treated me like I was the only one that he was going to see that day even though he had a lobby full of patients. I left knowing all the answers to my questions and was very satisfied.
