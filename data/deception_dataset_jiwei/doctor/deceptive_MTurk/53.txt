I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Robinson just to get some Botox done on my face and they were able to get me in to be seen that same week. I had never had Botox before, but Dr. Robinson was very helpful with making me understand the entire process. I was very pleased with the results and received a couple follow-up calls just to make sure that everything was going alright for me. Very helpful office staff and an all-around great experience for me. I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson.
