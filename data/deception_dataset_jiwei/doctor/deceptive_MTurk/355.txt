I started seeing Dr. William Healley in the Primary Care Network as my behavioral health consultant after a friend advised me of his superior health care. I have had uncontrolled panic attacks for a number of years and no doctors that I have seen in the past have seemed to be able to help and many of them seemed to just not care about the horrible effects panic attacks were having on my life. Dr. William Healley seemed to know the illness and it's causes very well and determined that I suffered from bipolar disorder and changed my treatment and I have been free from panic attacks for more than two years now. I cannot say enough to urge you to see Dr. Healley if you suffer as I did from panic or anxiety disorder. Thanks to Dr. Healley I have my life back now.
