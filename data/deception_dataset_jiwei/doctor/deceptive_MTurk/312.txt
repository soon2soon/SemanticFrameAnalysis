From the moment I walked into Dr. Valnicek's office, I knew I was in the right place. Like many people, I was nervous and skeptical about cosmetic surgery but Dr. Valnicek helped change my view on cosmetic surgery and made me feel right at home. I definitely didn't want the fake plastic surgery look and Dr. Valnicek knew exactly what I was talking about. I explained how much younger I felt on the inside and how agitated I was with the crow's feet around my eyes. Dr. Valnicek immediately understood how I felt and shared what needed to be done to fix my little problem. Even though I planned on just checking into cosmetic surgery, I was sold. About a month later, I was checking in for my procedure. Dr. Valnicek did a great job of explaining what was going to happen and how he was going to do it. And wow, the results were amazing! Since that time, I've shared my experience with close friends, two of which have chosen to also have elective cosmetic surgery (liposuction and a tummy tuck) and agree the results are astounding. Now, I look the age I feel. My friends can hardly believe how much younger a simple procedure can improve your look and I love getting checked out by everyone at the grocery store again! Take my advice, talk to Dr. Valnicek and you won't be dissapointed.
