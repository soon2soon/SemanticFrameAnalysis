I have been a patient of Dr Angela Mazza-Whelan for 10 years. Dr Mazza-Whelan has always provided myself and my family with exceptional medical care. She is a very skilled practitioner, which shows not only in her posted degrees, and Internal Medicine Board Certified certificates, but also in her hands on, caring, bedside manner. I feel she upholds the company's vision of a "Healthier Hamilton" I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan to anyone in the community who is seeking a new family doctor.
