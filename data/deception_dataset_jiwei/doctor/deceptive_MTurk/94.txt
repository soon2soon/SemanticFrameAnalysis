It has been such a fantastic relief to have Dr. Ernst Greyvenstein as my family's doctor. Whenever one must search for a new doctor there is always the sinking feeling that all the "good ones" have already been taken. My family and I stopped worrying once we found Dr. Greyvenstein. He has an excellent and kind bedside manner that immediately helped us relax. He really listens to our concerns and is attentive enough to know when we're feeling apprehensive about something. He is willing to take the extra time to get to know a person and their personality before diagnosing their symptoms. We have never had an appointment delayed, and he makes a point of never making anyone wait alone in a room for long. I can honestly say I look forward to going to the doctor now. I feel like I am being looked after. It's nice to feel as if someone is putting my needs and my health first, and their time and their money second. I recommend Dr. Greyvenstein to all my friends and family all the time.
