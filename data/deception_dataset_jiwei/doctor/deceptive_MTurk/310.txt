I can not say enough wonderful things about Dr. Valnicek and his staff. The staff was so warm and welcoming and I felt right at ease as soon as I walked in the door for my first visit. Aside from being an exceptional surgeon, Dr. Valnicek always treated me with the utmost professionalism and respect. I am thrilled with my results and would recommend Dr. Valnicek and the Okanagan Plastic Surgeons office to everyone. Thank you for a great experience. Another happy patient!
