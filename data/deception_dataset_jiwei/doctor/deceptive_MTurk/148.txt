I went to Dr. Grant Ayling today for the first time. I had just moved to the area and a friend mentioned him and I decided to give it a chance. I was so surprised how nice they are there. He was very attentive when I described my symptoms. And I would recommend people to see Dr Grant Ayling before anyone else.
