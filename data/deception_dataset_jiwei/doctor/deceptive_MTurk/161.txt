Dr. Silverman was a big help when I was making my decision about getting cosmetic surgery. He didn't push anything on me, he just laid out what the surgery entailed and what I could except of the outcome. He didn't sugarcoat the risks of surgery but Dr. Silverman was also very reassuring that the risks could be minimized. The outcome was even better than I had hoped and I am very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Dr. Silverman, he was professional, honest and very competent.
