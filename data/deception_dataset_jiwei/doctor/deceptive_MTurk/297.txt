I have always felt comfortable at Dr. Sheina Macadam's office. She is extremely knowledgable and won't push you towards options you are not comfortable with. She is willing to sit down over multiple sessions to make sure you get the results you want. And when you go in for your surgery, you'll go into a welcoming and clean OR, and then go into a home-styled recovery room. You won't be disappointed in the results.
