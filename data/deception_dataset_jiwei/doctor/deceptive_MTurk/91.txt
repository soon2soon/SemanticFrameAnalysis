With medical practice being as overburdened and hectic as it is today I was not expecting the level of care and attention that I received from Dr. Greyvenstein. Although it was obvious from the waiting area that the practice was quite busy the doctor took the time to slow down and address my concerns with patience. At no point did he seem harried or willing to just "get on to the next patient". He not only treated me like a person he did it with a smile.
