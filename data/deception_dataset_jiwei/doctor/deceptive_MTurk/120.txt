Recently I had to switch doctors as I was not happy with my doctor as I had been ill for several months and they had no solution and could not come up with a proper diagnosis. I came across Doctor Viviers at Niagara on the Lake family health and him and the entire staff were truly a blessing. Because of them I am finally better because they were thorough and continued to follow up with me until a proper diagnosis was made. Unlike many other doctors he is not just out to make a buck, I feel he does truly care about his patients. Doctor Viviers is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable and you can trust he has your best interest in mind. I can again trust a Doctor thanks to Doctor Viviers and the rest of the staff at Niagara on the lake. Not only do you get the great service of Doctor Viviers there are 9 other physicians on staff who cover for each other and they all seem to duplicate the efforts of Doctor Viviers. I would recommend Doctor Viviers and the entire Niagara on the lake practice to other family members and friends. Your health is an important part of your life and I think its important to find a practice that believes this as well and I have found this in Niagara on the lake.
