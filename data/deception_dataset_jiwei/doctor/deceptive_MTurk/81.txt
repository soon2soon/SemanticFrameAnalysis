Eric Bensimon is one of the most helpful and kind doctors you could hope to get. I went in on january 3rd 2012 for a nose job. Here i am today, looking better than ever, and it's all thanks to this wonderful man. He helped me find exactly what would look the best on me and then he perfected it to look amazing.
