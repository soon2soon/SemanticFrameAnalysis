I have visited the office of Broadway Family Physicians and I am highly satisfied with the level of professional medical service by Dr. Penelope Stalker. From the moment I walked into the office, I felt like I finally found a place where attention was given to me. Dr. Penelope is very skilled and informative during each of my visits. All of my questions were answered from Dr. Penelope and I was not whisked out of the door as in the past when I went to ther family doctors. I am very happy that I found a place where I can get quality care for my family and I.
