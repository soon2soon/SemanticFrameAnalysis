I have a been a long time patient at the Mediclinic in Saskatoon for over 10+ years. In all that time the staff at the medical office have always been exceptionally kind and competent in every area of medical procure they have performed. They have reasonable billing prices for the procedures and will work with you to pay off your bills if you are having money issues. My doctor, Johann Kriegler, has been my personal physician for the entire time and I would warmly recommend him to my friends and family and have in the past. Dr. Kriegler always listens to my questions and answers them in a way that doesn't lead to confusion or misdirection, and I love that about him. He is honest and forthright, making our doctor/patient relationship easy and communicative. I would give the medical office a 10/10 and Dr. Kriegler a 15/10 because he really is the kind of doctor that makes going to the doctor a pleasant experience.
