Dr. Macadam is a very good doctor. First off, the wait time to be seen is very short--around 5-10 minutes. The receptionists at the front are very friendly. They make filling out the initial paperwork very easy and are very willing to help you if you have questions. The nurses are also very helpful. They seem very knowledgeable and make you feel at ease. The facilities are also very clean. The equipment is brand new and state of the art. Dr. Macadam is a very kind doctor--she is very good at listening when you tell her your concerns. She is very detail oriented and thorough. After the surgery, she follows up with you personally and makes sure everything is ok. I had a few concerns and when she saw me, I was reassured that there was not anything to be concerned about.
