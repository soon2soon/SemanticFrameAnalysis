Before going to Lake View Medical Clinic and ending up in the wonderful hands of Dr. Cynthia Nave I suffered chronic migraines that were often times debilitating. Now, after undergoing a few botox injection sessions I can safely say I live a life free from the horrendous pain that they would often cause me. The staff were also incredibly friendly and help; both over the phone and in person. Thank you Dr. Cynthia!
