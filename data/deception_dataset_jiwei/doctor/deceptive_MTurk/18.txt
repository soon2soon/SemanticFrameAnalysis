Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a wonderful family doctor and would be an asset to any family in the Ontario area. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is great with children and parents alike. She is knowledgeable about all kinds of sicknesses and good at communicating with kids about their symptoms. She is also extremely helpful and good at making sure that the kids and parents understand their illnesses and treatments. Plus, like any good parent would know, waiting in a doctor's office with a sick kid is no fun for anyone. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is always very punctual and my family has never had to wait a long time for her appointments.
