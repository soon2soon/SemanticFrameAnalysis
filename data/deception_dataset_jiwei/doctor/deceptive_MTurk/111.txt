My son had been fighting a cough for several weeks before we decided it was bad enough to see a doctor for it. We were a little worried that he may have bronchitis. At 2 years old, you wish your kid was not sick at all and you are almost scared for them. Unfortunately we were new to the area and did not know any doctors in the area. Since being here though, we had established a number of relationships that I would consider friends. When we asked around, Dr. Lacombe's name was very popular among the results. We felt that if others around us were having good experiences with him and how he handles the children, then it can't hurt for us to try. I was still hesitant though as I have had very negative experiences with several other doctors. When I made the appointment, the nurse was very cordial. From the moment I walked in the door I felt at home rather than a doctor's office. They had all up-to-date equipment for many types of medical appointments. The nurses that built a chart and asked my son questions were very nice and knew how to work with kids. Dr. Lacombe was one of the nicest doctor's I have ever worked with and after a few quick tests he knew what was wrong with my son. He gave my son a sucker and a smile and made my son and I feel a little more comfortable. He prescribed us some antibiotics and his cough was cleared up in about 3 days. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lacombe. I have two other children that will be seeing Dr. Lacombe as well as my wife. It will take some convincing on her end, but I think that I can win her over. I have done it once before! Thank you Dr. Lacombe and staff! You made us feel very welcome in an area full of strangers. We look forward to seeing you again next time one of our children is in need of medical care.
