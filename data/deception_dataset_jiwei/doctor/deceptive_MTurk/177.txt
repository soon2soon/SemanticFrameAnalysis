Before I visited Dr. John Hasell, I was painfully aware of the size and shape of my nose. I had been teased incessantly as a child about it, and my high school years were a nightmare of constant harrassment. Consequently, I was timid, insecure and ashamed of my looks. Dr. Hasell was able to restore my confidence and dignity, and literally changed my life. I am now in college, and enjoying something I never had before--friendship, respect and fun! Thank you Dr. Hasell!
