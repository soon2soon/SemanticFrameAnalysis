Dr Mohammed M. Elahi is a pleasure to work with and I personally and highly recommend him. At first I was a little hesitant as this was my first time going through any kind of cosmetic work. Dr. Elahi made me feel comfortable and at ease when throughout my whole face lift procedure. He answered any and every question I had and his staff was also just as kind and helpful. After the several days of recovery, I got the results that I was looking for and I feel like a new person. I will definitely use Dr Elahi's services in the future If I consider getting more work done.
