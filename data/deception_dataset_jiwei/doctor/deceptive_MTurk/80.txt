Dr. Douglas A. Taranow is a wonderful, compassionate surgeon. I was not surprised to see that he stays up-to-date on all relevant knowledge. Even though other doctors turned me away, I realized it was a blessing in disguise when I was finally referred to him. I am glad he was the doctor to operate on me, instead of the others I saw earlier. Even though my case was difficult, he did a great job and I love the way I look now. No one can tell that I had surgery unless they know exactly where to look for the tiny scars and examine my skin closely. If I ever (God forbid) get in another accident and need more cosmetic surgery, he's the only one I would hire.
