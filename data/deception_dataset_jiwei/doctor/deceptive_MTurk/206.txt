Dr. Karima Ali is a kind, accommodating physician who considers the needs of her patients as her top priority. I remember that when I first visited her, I instantly felt important and special in her eyes despite the numerous patients left in the waiting room. I have visited her for many years. She frequently asks after my family even if they do not have an appointment scheduled for that day. Dr. Ali also is attentive even when I am not in the office. She made sure that my medications were not contraindicated when my pharmacist called to consult with her. She refers me to specialists whenever she feels it is completely necessary and only after a thorough work-up was completed. She also takes my fear of advanced testing such as CAT scans carefully into consideration and gives me short trials of prescription medication instead to treat my symptoms. I consider her a close family friend after all these years and I can tell that she also knows me well and appreciates my loyalty to her.
