Dr. Susan Hunter is an excellent physician. As one of her patient's I feel I am in good hands. Whenever I visit her practice, the staff is polite and friendly. The office area is organized, clean, and quiet. Dr. Hunter treats me in a very gentle manner whenever I go to see her. No matter how busy the office is, she always takes time out to listen to my concerns and address them. I feel very confident in Dr. Hunter's expertise and plan to keep her as my primary care physician.
