I went in to see Dr. Aboolian after a friend recommended him for his bedside manner. I initially went to see Dr. Aboolian just to get a consultation for a mini face lift. The girls at the front desk were very welcoming and even remembered my name. I was promptly taken to a consultation room and only minutes later Dr. Aboolian arrived. Unlike most doctors, he did not seem overwhelmed or rush the consultation. He took time to answer all my questions thoroughly and made me feel at ease while keeping a professional demeanor. After he was informed of what I was looking for and an examination, he told me that he did not feel that I needed a mini face lift that he would recommend a dermapeel instead. I found this very enlightening because even though he would have made more money off of the procedure I came in for, he put that aside and was honest with me. I will only go to Dr. Aboolian for any further procedures I may need. He really made me feel important.
