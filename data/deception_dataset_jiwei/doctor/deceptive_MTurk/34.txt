I went into the carpedium clinic under dr blanc to get facial surgery. I did not like the way that my nose was shaped. I say horror stories on television such as mr. jackson where plastic surgery made people even uglier. However, mr. blancs surgery helped me to look much better. He turned my nose from a beaky to a straight one. unlike other plastic surgeons, who try to tell me what to do dr blanc allowed me to say how I thought it should be done. I think that was one of the main reasons for sucess... the considerate nature of the doctor.
