15 yrs after having a c-section and 2 kids, my stomach was just a huge kangaroo pouch.  It was so overlapped,I hated looking in full length mirrors.  I did not even want my husband to see me naked.  It has only been a week since my tummy tuck/lipo  and I feel like a whole new woman! Yes, I am still sore and quite swollen but there is no more pouch! I can already see my feminine shape. The scar is thin and low.  Its beautiful work!  Dr. Taranow is a master scuplter!
