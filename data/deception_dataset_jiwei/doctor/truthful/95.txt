Dr. Greyvenstein is by far the best physician I have ever encountered.He answered my questions thouroughly and explained in detail the priority of the problem and the alternatives. Thanks "Doc" for caring about us your patients. He is from South Africa and played "rugby" which more than encourages the stem of conversation with him. THX
