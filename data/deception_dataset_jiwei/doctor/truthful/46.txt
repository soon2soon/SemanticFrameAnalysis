Amazing surgeon and person. I know him in terms of a supervisor/teacher and he is so concerned about his patients and their families and so dedicated to his work. His talent, knowledge and skills are unsurpassed and his humility and humbleness is unbelievable. He is truly one of a kind. He is an inspiration and a fantastic role model to training surgeons everywhere and a great comfort to families and their children.
