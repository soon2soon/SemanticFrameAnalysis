I am very pleased with the results of my rhytidectomy & blepharoplasty. The result is very natural looking, not extreme. Dr Robinson was highly recommended by friends and relatives. Burke Robinson has met my expectations with his skillful surgical expertise. The surgery was well worth my travel from out of state to have the surgery. I would do it again!
