I know you probably don't need to read another review about how amazing Doctor Forrest is but one feels the pressing need to tell the world about this surgeon. He is extraordinary. He is kind, patient, gentle and brilliant at what he does. If you get referred to Doctor Forrest count yourself a hundred thousand times lucky. He operated on my daughter for her craniosynistosis and did such a wonderful job. He goes above and beyond the call of duty and makes you feel you are taken care of and listened to. I think he is the finest doctor I have ever encountered. His staff obviously feel the same as every nurse and practitioner I encountered at Toronto Sick Kids spoke of him with the most revered tone and respect. Simply Amazing.
