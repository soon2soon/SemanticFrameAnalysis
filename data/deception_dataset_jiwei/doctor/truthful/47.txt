I work in the medical profession and when the time came for my daughter to see a plastic surgeon in conjunction with other pediatric M.D's, I knew exactly who I was going to ask to care for her.  I have known Dr. Forrest for many years and he has emerged as one of the leading craniofacial surgeons in North America.  He is thoughtful, caring and a perfectionist.  We are desperately short of surgeons that operate at his caliber.  If anyone's child is ever referred to Dr. Forrest, take a big breath in and feel relieved.  It's kind of like a lottery out there.  You could be referred to someone that is no where near as knowledgeable or capable.  This results in delays in treatment or poor treatment and outcomes. A referral to Dr. Forrest is like winning DoctorLoto649..... with you holding the wiining ticket.
