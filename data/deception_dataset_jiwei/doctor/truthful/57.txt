Dr Nave is the best doctor I've ever had. She does not hesitate to refer to specialists when it's required. Dr Nave is knowledgeable and up-to-date in her medical information. Nave always has time to discuss your concerns and never rushes you out of the office.Dr Nave has provided excellent health care to both my mother and me and I will continue being her patient as long as she is in practise. The staff in her office are polite, friendly and take the time to make you feel part of the "family". They remember your name from one appointment to another.Overall I rate Dr Nave as an excellent family physician and would recommend her to anyone.
