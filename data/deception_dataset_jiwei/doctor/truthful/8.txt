DR. Aboolian was very professional, honest and very responsible before and after my breast augmentation procedure. He makes sure you take the proper lab work to see if you can have surgery and be 100% healthy for surgery. He is very friendly and sees the patients with follow up appointments after surgery to make sure the process of the cosmetic surgery heals well and the way patients expect it to be. He has done cosmetic surgery on my parents and family friends as well and all of them have had an amazing, painless and great experience with him. I highly suggest anyone who is considering to get cosmetic surgery to see him since he is safe and  also very talented to achieve a good/natural look on any kind of cosmetic surgery.
