Dr Aboolian is great. I've been thinking about having breast augmentation for years but I was concerned about the surgery and recovery complications...after talking with him  for a few minutes, all the fears disappeared...He's very knowledgeable and patient. It's very clear he takes pride in his work, he pays close attention to detail. Also he made sure to achieve a "natural look", I'm very happy with the results. His staff is also amazing, they're caring and pleasant. I recommend him highly.
