Dr. Faul is or was our Doc but he couldn't deliver my son. I like Dr. Grev better. He was very helpful and caring. I'm upset that when I went to make my son's 4 month check up Dr. Faul was away and the lady on the phone was very rude and told me I couldn't see Dr. Grevvenstein because he wasn't taking any of Dr. Fauls patients and he's got his own. Dr. Grevvenstein made me very comfortable when my son was born. Thank for being there at 2am Dr. Grevvenstein. You did a great job and I wish you were my family doctor.
