Grant is a commendable doctor, Grant is no longer my doctor, but only because of my distance form his pratice now. He and I have had many frank discussions about treatment and he is very honest in what he believes. He sends his patients to highly rated specialists and has never demonstrated an ego that I can remember. He is the only doctor I have met that makes house calls to his patients, and one of the only doctors that has ever spoke to me plainly about health care. He has delivered all my kids, and despite the distance my wife and children will remain patients until he retires I imagine. I could not recommend a doctor with a higher rating, he is a quality individual.
