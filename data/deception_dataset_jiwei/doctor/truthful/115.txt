Had Dr. Viviers for a Dr. for about 3 years in Stony Plain Alberta. Best Dr. I ever had. Very helpful with my Post Polio Syndrome and helped me tolerate this PPS pain and all of its challenges. Need more Drs like this. I live in Fort Erie now, and am going to try and have Dr. Vivier take me on again as one of his patients. Jack Babcock
