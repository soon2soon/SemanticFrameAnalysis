I found Dr. Howley to be very pleasant and he really eased my stress. I went in because of a Dr. referral for a breast lift and tummy tuck. He explained everything in great detail and I would highly recommend him to anyone. I have seen his "work" on several other women I know, and all I can say is I can't wait to have my surgery done! So glad I have the opportunity to be under such great care. Thank you Dr. Howley.
