Dr. Viviers recently delivered my first child. He is a wonderful doctor who always takes the time to answer all of your questions and never acts like he's in a hurry. I always came out of my appointments happy with him. He is great with my baby. The only complaint I have is with the receptionists and the wait to get in to see him. I am glad I went to Dr. Viviers for my delivery and plan to continue to bring my daughter to see him and to see him for myself.
