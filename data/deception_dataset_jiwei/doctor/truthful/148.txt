I can't say enough good about her. She's the first doctor I've seen that didn't automatically discredit my use of natural birth control methods and try to cram the pill down my throat. She's also open to alternative medicine and tends to take a 'big picture' approach to health and treat the entire person, not just what hurts at the moment. Again, the only downside is getting in to see her, because so many people want to. Honestly, best doctor ever.
