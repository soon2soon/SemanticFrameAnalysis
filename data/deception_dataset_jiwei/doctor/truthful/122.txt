Dr. Viviers has been my doctor and my kid's doctor for almost 6 years- he is UNMATCHED by any other doctor I've been to. He doesn't treat you like a "dumb" patient- and always explains any tests he's ordering and/or the results. He takes the time needed without rushing anyone and is very patient with my rambunctious kids...My daughter will actually cry if she has to see a doctor other than him!! The wait to see him is worth it because I KNOW I will get the answers I need. He has never disappointed me, and I can never say enough good about him to others. We are VERY fortunate to have him as our family doctor.
