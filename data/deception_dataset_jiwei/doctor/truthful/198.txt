I have been in to see Dr. Hasell more than once. He is a great surgeon, has a wonderful personality and is very knowledgeable. HOWEVER, after my last visit, I refuse to go back. His secretary Peggy is one of the nastiest people I have ever met. She humiliated me in front of a room full of patients by announcing what I was in to see the doctor for. Everybody heard. Aside from that, she is rude and appears uncaring. If I could see Dr. Hasell away from his office and without having to be in contact with Peggy I would. Rumour has it that she is good at her job, I think not. She reminds me of a PittBull with PMS. She needs to be "put down".
