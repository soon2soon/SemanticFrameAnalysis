I always make an effort to see Dr. Kriegler rather than another doctor at the same clinic, even if it means a longer wait time. Dr. Kriegler is very patient and kind, and is always willing to answer my questions. He makes an effort to treat me like a person and not just another case. I find it amazing that he remembers personal details about me, such as my occupation, with no reminders; he must see thousands of people each month. I actually enjoy going to the doctor when I get to see him. He makes the experience as pleasant as possible, and I know I am in good hands.
