All you have to do is to walk into her clinic and watch how her staff respond & talk to patients.  They are absolutely amazing & that we know is all due to Dr Nave's own personality & how she treats them.  She is a very concerned & caring Dr, who shows true compassion, patience and understanding to my whole family.  Thanks so much for being our family doctor Cynthia.  I know we are all in very good hands with you.  Renee and Wayne
