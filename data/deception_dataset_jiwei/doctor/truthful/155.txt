I too cannot say enough good things about her. She takes care of the whole person, not just the body but the mind as well. She makes you feel like she has all the time in the world for you and listens very intently and with an open mind. She doesn't forget about you the moment you leave the office either. More than once I have received a phone call from her later that day or a few days later to see how things are going and/or to ask further questions. I feel that I am in good hands under her care.
