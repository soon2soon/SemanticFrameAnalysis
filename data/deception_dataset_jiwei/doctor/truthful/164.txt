At the risk of being redundant, I'm going to have to repeat some of the other comments that have been posted here. Dr. Ayling is caring, empathetic, and knowledgeable. He dy-mystifies health care, always takes the time to discuss the issue, and gives detailed explanations. He absolutely inspires confidence and trust. I wish we had more like him. (I gave him a 5 on punctuality because it's worth the wait, and his staff are really good about telling you how late he's running so you can plan around it.)
