Dr. Richards is an extremely knowledgeable and talented surgeon. He performed my breast augmentation about a month ago and I couldn't be happier with the results! I was anxious about the surgery but after the consultation I felt confident he was the right choice for me. I experienced very minimal/manageable post-op discomfort and my healing process has gone very smoothly - a credit to Dr. Richard's skill as a surgeon. I would recommend him to anyone seriously considering this procedure.
