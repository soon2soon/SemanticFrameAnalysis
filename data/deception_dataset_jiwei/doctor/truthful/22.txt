We had Angela for over 20 years. While there, she took great care of our whole family- over 12 of us went there. My own family now goes elsewhere as we had an unfortunate falling out due to my disability, but I don't blame her for it. I think she gets frustrated when she doesn't have all the answers for certain illnesses, and then one can lose touch on a compasison level. Although our new doctor is great, I do miss Angela and felt secure with her expertise for my family. There is no better doctor for children however- they get first rate. Adults, well, she does what she can.....
