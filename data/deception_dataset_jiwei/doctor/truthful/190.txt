I once told my mother when I was really young that I wanted to become a doctor just like Dr. Kriegler. After going to him for many years, and from him even catching other things other doctors didn't see right away.. like a hole in a lung! Many years later I am now working in Nuclear Medicine and may go on to medicine. Who would of thought.
