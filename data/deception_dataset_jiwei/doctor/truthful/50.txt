I couldn't agree more with the comments that have been made about Dr. Forrest.  He has performed 2 surgeries on our precious daughter. First when she was 12 and then 15 years of age. And possibly has more to come in the near future. She required surgery to her face due to a rare disease.  His bed side manner is like no other Dr. that I have ever encountered.  My daughter loves going to visit with him because of his kind and warm nature, he always makes you feel like you are the most important patient he is seeing at the time.  You are never rushed and he takes all the time you need to explain everything that he is going to do. Thank you so much to Dr. Forrest and Alison for their kindness, warmth and extreme talent.
