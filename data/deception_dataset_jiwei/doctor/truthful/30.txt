Dr Lurie is an excellent doctor. He is very thorough and makes my family and myself very comfortable. We have been seeing Dr. Lurie since he has been in Courtice. Michelle has one of the best personalities that I have seen in any customer oriented environment. She remembers us every time we come in and always returns messages promptly. I don't know how she handles the office alone. We couldn't be happier with Dr. Lurie and Michelle.
