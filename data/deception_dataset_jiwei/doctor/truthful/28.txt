My daughters and I just started seeing Dr. Lurie. Even though we have only seen him a couple of times, I cannot say enough good things about him. We've never had to wait to see him, he has always been on time, he is very thorough when he talks and he seems to have a gentle nature. My teenaged daughters seem very comfortable with him. His assistant, Michelle, is very pleasant to deal with as well! I am very pleased so far!
