Very professional MD. Has a small town quality of remembering patients from previous appointments. He asks questions with great concern and yet has the abiltiy to make conversation and adds some light humor when appropriate. He goes above and beyond ordering tests to be done if the patient has any serious concerns or worries. I think he's Great!
