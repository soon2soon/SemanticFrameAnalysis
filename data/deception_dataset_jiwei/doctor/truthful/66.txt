Very caring and has patients best interest at heart.  She is punctual, knowledgable and has been a fantastic help to me and my family over the years.  She can be tough to get to see within a week or so but is competent, caring and very helpful.  She has made a couple of mistakes but is open to acknowledge those mistakes and is unpretentious.  Makes a patient feel very comfortable even though I am a man.  I have no reservations about discussing anything with her.  I trust her and respect her a great deal.  One of the best Drs I have ever had!!!
