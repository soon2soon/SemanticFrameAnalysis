It took me a while after my Dr. .... Dr. Hindmarsh retired to find a caring doctor.  I went through a few and then my husband found Dr. Nave and at that time she was still taking new patients, so I started going to her.  She is caring, knowledgeable and genuine.  She orders tests if she's not sure what is wrong and while waiting weeks for results to come back you can talk to her about your concerns.  A little over 2 years ago my grandson was born with a very serious heart defect.  Although Dr. Nave has never met my grandson, she always asks about how he is doing.  She's just a great person all round...and I have NEVER heard the staff talk about anybody....I guess because IF I have to wait for any length of time I will read instead of try to hear what is going on behind the desk.
