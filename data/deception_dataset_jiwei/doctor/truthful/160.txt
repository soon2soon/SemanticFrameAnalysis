I work in a hospital as an RN, and have come across many good and not so great physicians. Grant is at the very top of the best. He is a caring, thorough GP, which is a very rare thing these days. He delivered both my kids, 1 of whom had many compiications. He held my hand through the entire delivery while the high risk team took over. This is why his practice is so busy, and not always on time- I would rather wait 2 hours for him than been seen quickly by someone who doesn't listen or care as much as he does.
