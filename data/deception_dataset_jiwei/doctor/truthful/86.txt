I would recommend this doctor to anyone in a heart beat. He is very knowledgeable, takes the time to answer all your questions and is very sensitive to your concerns and feelings. I had a breast augmentation and am EXTREMELY satisfied with the results. Exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Also I have hardly any bruising whish to me would mean very gentle. The Doc is just as kind post-op with answering questions and taking the time for any concerns. A+++++
