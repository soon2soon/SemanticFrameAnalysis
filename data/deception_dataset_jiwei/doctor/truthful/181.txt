I would agree with others here. He is an amazing Doctor. I feel very fortunate to have him for a doctor. He is extremely caring, yet very professional. He doesn't hesitate to recommend you to a specialist if he feels it would be helpful. I wish I had met him a lot sooner. Pleasant easy to talk to, personable are all qualities he possesses.
