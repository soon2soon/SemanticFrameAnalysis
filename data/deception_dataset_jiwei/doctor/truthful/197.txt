I have always had great service from Dr. Hasell and from his receptionist.  Peggy accommodates my time constraints due to my job.  The two professionals make you feel at ease and I have switched from my former plastic surgeon to Dr. Hasell due to the way I am treated.  They both are very sincere when working with me. This is important to me as a patient.
