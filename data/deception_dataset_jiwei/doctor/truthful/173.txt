I had a tummy tuck and a breast lift 4 weeks ago and I am very pleased with the results thus far.  Dr. Silverman did a super job.  Prior to surgery, he was very helpful and answered all my questions.  He met with me a few times.  Post surgery, the follow-up has been very good.  Dr. Silverman is kind, patient, meticulous, and very professional.  I would definitely recommend this doctor with the best bedside manners!
