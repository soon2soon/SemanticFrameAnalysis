Based on the previous comments, you may not feel the need to read any other winning comments about Doctor Forrest. But when a doctor is this good and this caring and this committed it can never be said enough. Doctor Forrest performed surgery on my daughter when she was 9 months and did a fabulous job, but his continued care and involvement in her health, his availability, his gentle spirit and his kind heart make him the BEST doctor I have ever encountered. If you are lucky enough to be under his care feel blessed. You couldn't ask for better. He is a great doctor a great man and an artist.
