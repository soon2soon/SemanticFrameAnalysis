I was very impressed by Dr. Richards' professionalism. I was anxious about having a breast augmentation and he made me feel comfortable and answered all my questions as if I was his only patient. I never once felt rushed into making a decision or during any of the visits. I also felt he was very thorough the way he provided information regarding the surgery. Will defintely recommend Dr. Richards to anyone!
