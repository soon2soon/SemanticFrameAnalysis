I cannot say enough about Dr.Barnardo. She is certainly the most compassionate doctor I have ever had. I appreciate her enthusiasm about both my care and that of my families. IF my children are not with me when I see her, she asks about all three of them. I appreciate her immediate follow up and then phone calls just to make sure I am okay. I believe a doctor who takes the time to talk and get to know a patient on a more personal level will be better able to care for that patient in the future. Dr.Barnardo is one of those doctors. She could definately teach a thing or two to many of doctors I have seen throughout the years. I feel my family has been truly blessed to fall into the caring hands of this lovely woman.
