iI have been into the office several times. Good treatment. I too had a problem with my first encounter with peggy. I was standing at her desk waiting to pay for my service while she was on the telephone and she very rudely pointed to a chair and told me to "sit down in that chair until I am ready to help you", I have never been scolded in such a rude way!!! I was shocked! This is supposed to be a professional office, since when do you not stand at the front counter to pay? When I finally did get to pay, she did not apologize, but told me she was having a busy day. A busy or bad day warrants no excuse for yelling at customers.
