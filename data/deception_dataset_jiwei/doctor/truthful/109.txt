Straight to the point, fast apopintments, if you have questions he has answers. Doesn't overwhelm you with a ton of information tells you important stuff of the week or month you are at. Does full routine checks everytime(unlike other doctors my friends are seeing). The big downfall is the waiting time in his office... it can take 5 minutes like it can take 1hr but you just have to tell yourself one day it will be you making others wait since he will be there for you, which makes me feel a lot better:) He is great go for it if ever you need a good doctor.
