Dr Viviers is the best doctor i have ever found in my life.  Since he has moved from Alberta our family has suffered greatly, my daughter turned ill shortly after he moved and now we are going on almost three years of hell.  No other doctor will listen and she is suffering greatly, we all are.  We miss Dr Viviers and want him back so bad we could cry......Ontario is so lucky that such a fine man like Dr.  Viviers moved there. My family is tempted to follow just so he can help my daughter.  we miss him and need him.  There is no other Doctor who cares or listens as much as he does.
