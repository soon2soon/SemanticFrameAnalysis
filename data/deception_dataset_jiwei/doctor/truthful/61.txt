Dr Nave and all her staff are the best!!! i would never change my doc and wished that she delivered babies then i could go see her all the time while being pregnant i don't believe when people have bad words to say about her or her staff i have been seeing her for almost 10 years...and they all have been nothing but nice to me and anyone i know that sees her.
