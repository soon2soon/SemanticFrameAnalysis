Dr. Ayling was one of the best doctors I've ever had, and patient and understanding ALWAYS.  Despite the fact I left the province 16 yrs ago, I still wish he was my Doctor!!  I would love to have a Dr. I have some confidence in, here in Calgary!  Thanks Grant for the good memories of all your help and kind words
