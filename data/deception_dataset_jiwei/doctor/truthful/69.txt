Dr. Nave is an excellent doctor and as other comments she is so caring and never too busy to take time with you in her office. She refers you to specialists without any hesitation. I am a cancer survivor and attribute much of my quick referral to Dr. Nave. Her staff are friendly and always phone you with results from even a blood test which helps for peace of mind.
