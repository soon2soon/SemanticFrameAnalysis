I spent countless hours researching cosmetic surgeons, their background, education, patient care, their patient satisfication and outcome of the procedures.  Above all, I made certain that the surgeons who made the list were Board certified.  I came to Dr. Richards in 2002 and have returned to him since.  I recommended Dr. Richards to my mother and sister and as always, he performed phenomenal work on both.  I have referred other healthcare professionals to him.  I have clients who are in the cosmetic surgery field and will only allow Dr. Richards to be my surgeon. I always receive compliments from women and men.  I work hard to keep the body that Dr. Richards has helped me to attain.  I'm a proponent for cosmetic surgery and an even bigger advocate for Dr. Richards.
