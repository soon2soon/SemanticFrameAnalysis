if i could rate them a 6. I would. the staff is great, the place is spotless and everyone is professional and very organized.  as for the doctor himself well there arent enough word to explain how much I liked his work.  I got a breast and arm lift and I coulnt be happier.. his stiching (what stiching)  is remarkable and hardly noticable. It doesnt even look like I had surgery and its only been 10 months. His knowledge is threw the roof. the man knows what hes doing... I highly approve of all the work hes done for me..
