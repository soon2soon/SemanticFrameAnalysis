We love Dr. Lurie. Both my husband and I have been seeing Dr. Lurie for a couple years now. We feel so fortunate to have such a wonderful Doctor. I just love is soft voice and gentle manner. He is so incredibly knowledgeable about everything you need to know. We also hope he never retires, how could he ever be replaced. Michele is a great office manager, gets back to you immediatley if you leave her a message. Never a long wait to get an appointment or to see the doctor. Best best best doctor I have ever had.
