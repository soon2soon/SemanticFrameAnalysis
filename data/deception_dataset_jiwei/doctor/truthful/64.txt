Dr.Nave has been an outstanding,pleasant surprise after experiencing two less than satisfactory doctors after moving to Saskatoon. Dr. Nave listens, takes time and presents questions which help her diagnose areas of health concerns. If there is need, she quickly refers to speicalists to get proper testing or specialized assistance. I feel 100% confident that she is knowlegable and ready to apply her knowledge or that of her referral in dealing with my situation. How much better can it be? Note: she is not predisposed with the computer to the point she talks, listens and communicates at the highest level. Thank you Dr. Nave for being YOU!
