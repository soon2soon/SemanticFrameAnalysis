Very helpful, and making sure that his patients get information that they are seeking. He is a wonderful doctor that took me and my son in as clients when there was a shortage. Me and my son moved here to southern ontario 4 years ago and took 2 years to find a doctor, until one day my co-worker mentioned to me that he was accepting new patients. Great Job Dr. Lurie. I would recommend him to anyone that is looking for a doctor.
