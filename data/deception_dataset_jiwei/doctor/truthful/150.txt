Dr. Barnardo is the most patient, caring & thoughtful doctor I've ever met. She always takes the time to address all of our concerns & questions. My 4 year old loves visiting her and looks forward to his check-ups (& his baby brother's). Even when my children are not with me, Dr. Barnardo always asks about them (& even gives me stickers for my son). Our family is so fortunate to have such a wonderful doctor - I would recommend her in a heartbeat!!
