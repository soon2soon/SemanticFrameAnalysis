I HAD HIP LIPOSUCITON WITH DR RICHARDS FOUR YEARS AGO, AND I NOW HAVE THE SMALLEST WAIST ON THE EAST COAST.  IT'S GREAT.  HE LIPO'D MY ARMS AND I CAN NOW WEAR SWEATERS WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE AN OLD LADY. I JUST HAD A FULL FACE LIFT SIX WEEKS AGO AND I LOOK FANTASTIC!!!!! I'M ALMOST 63, BUT PEOPLE THINK I'M STILL GOOD LOOKING! DR RICHARDS IS EXTREMELY SINCERE AND HIS TWO CONCERNS ARE...YOUR SAFETY......AND HOW GOOD DO YOU LOOK NOW?  THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS, AND HIS ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT IN HELPING YOU LOOK GOOD ARE SO GRATIFYING. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO PUT MYSELF IN HIS HANDS AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!!
