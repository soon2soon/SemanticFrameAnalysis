This comment is in regards to Dr.Hasell's receptionist Peggy. Every single experience I have EVER had with Peggy has been extremely wonderful, and helpful. She is incredibly nice and does whatever she can to help you. I have NO idea what everyone else is talking about. If you are kind to her she is more than willing to return the favour. I believe it's all in the way you treat her, if you're rude to her OF COURSE she is going to be unwilling to be nice to you. I've called numerous times with many many questions and she is always willing to help me out regardless of how busy she is (which is extremely).
