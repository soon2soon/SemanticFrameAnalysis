Before moving forward with my breasts augumentation surgery, I met with my many doctors. Dr Taranow was the only doctor I felt I could trust. He not only enured that there is ample time to answer all my questions and concerns but he answered them with honesty. It has been about four months since my surgery and I am very happy. I would recommend him to my family and friends.
