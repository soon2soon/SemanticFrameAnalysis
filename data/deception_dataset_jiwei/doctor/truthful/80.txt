I had my tummy tuck wliposuction surgery on 4/15/11 and now, 2.5 months later I am thrilled.  Dr Taranow gave me shape and body that I have always wanted and could not achieve no matter how much I worked out.  He is a perfectionist, if you ask me, and I am glad he is.  Now, at age 50, I am turning as many heads as I did when I was 30.  I am so happy and will definitley use him again if/when I decide to do something else.  You only live once and you can't take your money with you..
