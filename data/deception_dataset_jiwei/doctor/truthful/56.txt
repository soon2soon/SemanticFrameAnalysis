You really can't get any better then Dr. Forrest. Beyond being the best Pediatric Plastic Surgeon in the world, he is also the nicest. He should have a statue made in his honour. When you are sitting in the waiting room while your child is in surgery, it brings you a sense of comfort knowing that Dr. Forrest is the one looking out for your child. An great Doctor and a great Person. Thank you Dr. Forrest, for everything you have done for us.
