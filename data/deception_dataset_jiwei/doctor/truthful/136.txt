Dr. Richards and his staff have surpassed my expectations in countless ways. From my first appointment forward, I felt comfortable and at ease working with this medical team. The results from my surgery (breast augmentation) also exceeded my expectations. Dr Richards not only masterfully enhanced my breasts in size and shape; he also ridded me of a condition called Tuberous Breasts. In many ways, I feel more alive than I ever have. The decision to have plastic surgery is not something to take lightly, but if you decide surgery is best for you -- I highly recommend Dr. Richards. The entire process was seamless; quick pre-surgery screening, painless surgery, very quick healing, minimal discomfort and informative follow up visits with before and after pictures. He and his staff are friendly and professional, but most important they are fair and honest.
