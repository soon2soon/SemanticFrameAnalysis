Our son was born with a condition that required cranial surgery. He was first worked on by Dr. Hoffman, and the surgery was totally successful. After Dr. H. retired, our son was referred to Dr. Forrest, and he did amazing work putting the finishing touches on the work so that most people have no idea that our son has ever had any surgery. Our son is now 19, and is a well adjusted young man attending University. Our family owes Drs Hoffman and Forrest an enormous debt.
