I can not even put into words how unbelievable Dr Nave is. She makes you feel like you are the only patient she ever deals with and as if she has all the time in the world for you. I'm glad that she is now the doctor of my children too-we consider ourselves "lucky" on a doctor day! And I love the last comment-even us women think she is too darn cute!!
