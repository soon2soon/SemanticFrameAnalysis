Dr. Kriegler is not our regular GP, but I have taken my son to see him on a few occassions at the mediclinic due to sports injuries. We learned that Dr. Kriegler has a much higher level of knowledge in the area of orthopedics than most GP's, through my son's physiotherapist when she really needed an expert opinion before beginning his treatment. She called to the mediclinic and he was on, therefore it was just a matter of running him over to have him assessed. I was very impressed with his knowledge, mannerism, and the way he was able to communicate with my son and reassure him. He also called his physiotherapist immediately after seeing him and spoke with her directly, which I really appreciated him doing. This allowed her to start his treatment on the same day, which wouldn't have been possible without his help. Since that time, I have used the 8th Street Mediclinic and Dr. Kriegler whenever possible for any orthopedic types of problems. He is Great!
