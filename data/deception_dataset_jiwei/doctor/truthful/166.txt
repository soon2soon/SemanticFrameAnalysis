Dr. Silverman is just simply "The BEST". I was so fortunate to find him. A woman at my gym was showing off her flat tummy and diamond in her belly button. I said I wished I had a stomach like that and she whispered,you can.Dr. Silverman.I checked out 15 plastic surgeons and boiled it down to 5 .I went to my first free assessment with another doctor and felt ok, I was a little worried as he asked nothing about me..just that he would do it, and the cost...so my second inteview was with Dr.Howard Silverman, he talked to me for over half an hour to get all my story. I had just lost 150 pounds and the skin was hanging on my stomach..I was in my late 50s so I was nervous. As soon as he discussed the procedure I just knew I could put my life in his hands and I would be ok. He was remarkable..I couldnt imagine going to anyone else..  Dr. Silverman is wonderful,extremely kind,caring and talented. Thank you Dr. Silverman.
