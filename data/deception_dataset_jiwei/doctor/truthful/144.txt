Amazing personality...truly caring and determined to get to the bottom of things. Dr. Barnardo takes the time to find a solution to the problems or illness that I have presented. She is also very comforting and concerned about your health and wellbeing. She is by far the best doc in the city in my opinion. I have referred many people to her, all of which are satisfied as well..
