I feel very lucky to have Dr Ayling as our family doctor. Its true that you have a long wait to get in to see him but I feel it is worth it as when your with him he takes his time. You don't feel rushed out. He also has an awesome sense of humour and gives it to you straight up. When you hear the horror stories of other doctors and from what I have experienced from other docs...I am so relieved to be under his care.
