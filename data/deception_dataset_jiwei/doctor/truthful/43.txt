I felt very comfortable with Dr. Robinson from the second I walked into his office.  The service was great.  I had my consultation 4 days after I called and the surgery was scheduled only one week later.  I had a rhinoplasty and chin implant and the results couldn't be better. It is very natural looking.  I had minimal bruising and was able to go out in less than a week.  I would refer anyone looking for facial plastic sugery to see him!
