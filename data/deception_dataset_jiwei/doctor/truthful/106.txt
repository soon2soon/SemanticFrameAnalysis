My family moved to Calgary 3 years ago and had a very hard time finding a good dr. He takes the time to listen to everything you have to say and dosen't make me feel like we are wasting his time. I think he genuinly cares about all his pateints and your worries quickly become his. I never hesitate to bring my kids to him for anything knowing that he is a parent too. He always greets us with a smile and seems to really love his choice for a career. I would and have recomened him to anyone who will listen.
