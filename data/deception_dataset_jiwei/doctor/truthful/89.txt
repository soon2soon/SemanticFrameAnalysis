Dr. G is, indeed, one of the best doctors I have ever had the privilege of knowing. I trust him totally; he is very thorough, very knowledgeable both as a GP and an OBGYN, and answers questions with patience and understanding. We rarely have to wait in his office, and everyone I know that sees him speaks very highly of him, and we're all blessed that he is our doctor. Thanks, Dr. G. for being the wonderful person/doctor that God has brought to our community. (Oh, by the way, ladies, he's an expert at performing PAP smears ... I didn't feel a thing the last time! 10/10)
