I had been to numerous consultations with various plastic surgeons over the years with no luck.  I decided to go to one more surgeon and that surgeon was Dr. Taranow.  He mentioned things about my body type that no other surgeon took into consideration.  Dr. Taranow knows that every body type is different so there fore the procedure and outcome will be different for each case. He is an amazing surgeon and a perfectionist.  You know you are going to look good because he is very demanding of himself.  He is always available to talk - before and after surgery and you can't say that about a lot of doctors.  He is truly concerned with his patients well being.  My BA turned out perfect!  I couldn't be happier.
