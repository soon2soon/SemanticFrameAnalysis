I seen Dr. Hasel for a consult, I was very happy and pleased with him, he answered all of my questions did not seem rushed at all. I have a surgery booked with him in January but I'm hoping to get in sooner. As for peggy she has been fine every time I called there, she has tried to be accomdating in every way, we all have bad days,I wouldn't knock her for it.
