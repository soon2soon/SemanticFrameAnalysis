Sorry Doug, not happy. You put breast implants in me some years back and I had to have out. One pointed imediately to right. I got bad stretch marks that never went away. You shrugged your shoulders and told me to see a laser person or another and my right breast muscle is always in spasm bc you cut the muscle and I have never slept well ever since then. It's like I have some terrbile costochondritis that has NEVER resolved despite years and my right breast flinches involuntarily. I regret that I went here. I think there are better surgeons out there and P.S. looking back and being so young it was not cool to ask me what type of underwhere I was wearing in the dressing room. And when I got a sore throat after the procedure that I oculd not get rid of and my doc put me on ABX that were strong you asked me point blank was he trying to cover soem STD. Totally insulting. I was young then and if that was now I would tell you off and walk out. Shame Shame.
