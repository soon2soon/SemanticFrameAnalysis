I have been going to this doctor for some time now about l3 years. He has always given me the best advice and referred to a specialist when needed. I am sorry he is too busy to take my husband as a patient. He is always appropriatly dressed and scrubs and pleasant and he does listen to me. Always make ure sthere are no other complaints before he has taken care of me.
