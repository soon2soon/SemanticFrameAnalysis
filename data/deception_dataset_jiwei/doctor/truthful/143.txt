I love Dr. Barnardo...she's very helpful and doesn't talk down to you. She's very kind and never seems to be in a hurry or irritated. She's very punctual and when she had to order a test for me she did it very quickly and promptly. I would reccommend her to anyone! She's the best doctor I've ever seen!!!
