He is very friendly and has a great bedside manner. He is professional and is great with the kids. This is the first time I have had a male doctor and I am very comfortable talking with him. Thankfully we haven't had to see him for anything serious but when we come to him for a minor problem he is able to tell us immediately what is the problem.
