I was looking for a cosmetic surgeon who was detailed, meticulous and would spend time to answer my many questions. Dr. Richards was one of 3 surgeons I interviewed and our first meeting was an hour long. He was able to answer all of my questions in great detail and reviewed the procedure, the risks and the recovery process. (Other doctors actually scoffed at my long list of questions.) I met with Dr. Richards twice before deciding to have surgery and knew that Dr. Richards was the right doc for me. In looking at before/after photos, he knew the specifics of each patient and which body structure would be closest to my result. In addition, I was impressed with his experience as an Army doctor (shows discipline) and with the burn unit (a tough complication to work with.) My procedure went well, and had 3 follow-up visits in the months after surgery (included in his fee.) I liked his professional, detailed demeanor and his staff was wonderful as well.
