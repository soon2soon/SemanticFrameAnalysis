Although I hardly ever go (once every year or two) she always remembers things about me without having to dig into my file for 15 minutes first, shes warm and makes me feel like the only patient in her office even though shes always busy! Ive had to cancel a couple appointments and she was compassionate enough NOT to take me off her patient list after threatening to and for that Im forever greatful!! Overall she is the best family practitioner ever and anyone fortunate enough to be on her list better respect how lucky you are
