I have been going to Dr. G for the past 2.5yrs since I had my son and I am so happy with his care. He really is a very genuine and caring person. I just feel so lucky to have found him when we moved here a few yrs ago and only wish I'd found him before I started seeing my OBGYN. To this day I still wish he had delivered my son. Thank you Dr. Greyvenstein for your excellent care you provide to me and my son and all your other patients.
