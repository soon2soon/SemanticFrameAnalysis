Dr. Mazza-Whelan has been my doc since I was 22. I am now 43. When I gave birth to my son, she was at the hospital the next day checking him. She has always taken the best care of my son and I. I need to see specialists and have tests done frequently, and she is always on top of my medical health issues. If I am needing other care, Ang is immediately on top of it making the necessary referrals. I appreciate how she is the one to contact me when she finds negative results in my tests. She is more like a friend than a doctor, as she knows so much about me and my son. She never fails to ask how he is and is genuinely concerned with any and all issues we deal with on a medical or personal level. Our medical system is so lacking fine doctors. I am extremely thankful to have Dr. Mazza Whelan as my family physician.
