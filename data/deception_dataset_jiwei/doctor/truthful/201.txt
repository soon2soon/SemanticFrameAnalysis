I had a BA, Lift and tummy tuck done.  The results are amazing.  Very minimal scarring.  The only pain I experienced was in my lower back, and that was from overcompensating on my stomach muscles.  I was very nervous going into this as I had a lot done all at once.  Dr. Hassel was always so kind and patient with me and put me right at ease, both in his office and at the hospital.  He answered all my questions to my satisfaction.  I never ever felt rushed in my appointments with him.  His staff were very helpful, pleasant and understandng.  I would recommend Dr. Hassel a million times over.
