I went to Dr. Silverman looking for a lift and augmentation. He advised against the lift in my case, stating his opinion is that it's not necessary, saving me money! The augmentation was wonderful but one of my implants didnt't drop fully (always a risk) and at 8 months we revised with a very simple (no charge) surgery. The result was not ideal for me and tho he disagreed that it was necessary (very minor change to be made) he did the re-revision, again no charge because my satisfaction was paramount. He was very sure to state from the initial consultation that perfection is impossible and if one is seeking perfection they will always be disappointed. Great advice from a surgeon in my opinion. Keep that in mind when you read negative posts on ANY plastic surgeons review...
