Arnold Lurie was my Dr from his early days in Canada up until he moved from his Thornhill practice. It took me 3 yrs and multiple attempts to find another Dr that I even somewhat trusted. You're a hard act to follow, Arnold, and I miss you and think of you every time I walk into a Dr's office. I would leave my present Dr and go back to you in a heartbeat. Please come back to Thornhill. It's time now.
