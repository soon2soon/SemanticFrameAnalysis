Dr. Richards did a "mommy makeover" for me (Vaser liposuction of the inner and outer thighs, abdomen, flanks and upper arms, along with breast augmentation).  I chose him because of his extensive experience and because his results are so natural.  He was extremely professional and knowlegeable during my pre-op consultations, and the results are even better than I could have hoped for--they continue to get better every day.  I'd recommend Dr. Richards very highly!
