This doctor did a miracle with my breats lift and augmentation. It has been three months now and it is perfection.  All the other doctors that I saw told me that I would have to get other surgeries after the first one because I was a difficult case and they were charging me $13,000 plus the touch up.  Dr. Silverman is so calm and perfectionnist and his staff is super.  I am getting another surgery with him and I trust him like I never trust any doctors before.
