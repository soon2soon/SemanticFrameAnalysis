A visit to Dr Nave is more like visiting a good friend then going to the Dr but with all the benifits of a great doctor. She is friendly, caring, truly interested in you as a person as well as a patient and always willing to spend the time to hear what you have to say. She is by far the very best Doctor I have had in my entire life. Thanks Dr. Nave :)
