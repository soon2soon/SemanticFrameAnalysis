My experience with the offices of Dr. Burke Robinson has been nothing but professional.  Everyone in his offices has been extremely polite, cordial, and I was treated with the utmost respect.  I have been very happy with the results of Dr. Robinson's work.  I would definitely refer him to a friend or collegue.
