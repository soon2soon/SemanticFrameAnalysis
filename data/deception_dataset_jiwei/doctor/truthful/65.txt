I love Dr. Nave!  I've been a patient of hers for years.  I came back to see her even when I lived in Calgary and when I moved back I was so lucky she took me back as a patient.  I wish everyone could have a doctor as great as I do.  I can't believe anyone would say anything bad about her!  I can't imagine having to find another doctor.  I hope I die before she retires, but she takes such good care of my health I'll probably live to 100!
