Dr. Silverman is amazing! He did an abdominoplasty and breast lift with implants for me. It looks very natural and no one would know that I even had this type of surgery. I'm completely satisfied and would recommend him to anyone. He is honest, straighforward, caring, knowledgeable and he seems to enjoy the work he does. His secretary is also very nice and knowledgeable. I really felt like they cared about me. Dr. Silverman was very professional. I really can't say enough about it!
