My Neck/S-Lift procedure performed in March 2009 was handled in a very professional manner.  The ear incisions are so barely noticeable that I can wear my hair pulled back with confidence.  There were no post operative complications.  The healings progressed just as Dr. Richards advised, and I was able to attend a social event three weeks after surgery.  I am very satisfied with the overall results.  My neck and jaw line look natural and more youthful. The numerous post-op visits were reassuring. I would recommend Dr. Richards to anyone seeking to have this procedure performed, he is truly a gifted cosmetic surgeon.
