dr. lurie is a very iontelligent, personable man and a wpnmderful person. he took care of me as well as my children for years. i cannpt believe i fpund him again. i have never met a doctor like him and i would highly recommend this doctor to anyone. hje has a wonderful knack for putting a patient at ease. i miss him terribly.
