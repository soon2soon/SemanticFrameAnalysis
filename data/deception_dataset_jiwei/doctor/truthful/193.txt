I had breast Augmentation 16 days ago, and am beyond thrilled with the whole procedure. I had absolutely no pain after,(never took any of the prescribed T3's.)I have felt fantastic the whole time. My stitches dissolved within nine days, and "the girls" look great. I would, and have recommended Dr Hasell to others, just as I was recommended from a friend. I am so happy with the ease everything was done from the making of my appointment to Peggy's follow up call, She is so funny, and made me feel very comfortable, never a bother. So glad I did this, as is my Husband ;}
