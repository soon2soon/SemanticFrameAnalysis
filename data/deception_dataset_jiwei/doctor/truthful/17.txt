I have been a patient since 1988 and my son his a patient too. She's the greatest and always takes the time to explain things. She has got me through the ups and downs of life. I don't look forward to the day she retires (sorry) because I don't know where I'd find a replacement as great, wonderful and kind as her. You're the best!!!
