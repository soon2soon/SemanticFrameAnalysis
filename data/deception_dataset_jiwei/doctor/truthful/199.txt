I would recommend Dr. Hasell.  I had a BA on July 22 and I am very happy with the results.  Peggy was friendly with me in person and on the phone.  I called a couple of times with questions after my surgery and she was very helpful.  Dr. Hasell called me back at home the day after surgery because I had concerns about having lots of swelling in my body.  He said it was due to the anesthetic and the I.V. Also, just prior to surgery I was quite emotional and he was very comforting with me.
