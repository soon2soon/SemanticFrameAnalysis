Dr. Kriegler's good reviews are all valid. He is a very competent and personable physician. I am a gay man and a non-judgmental doctor is very important to me. Dr. Kriegler is very knowledgeable and sensitive of LGBT health concerns. I feel completely at ease speaking to him about any health issue because I know that I will be treated with respect. I wish all doctors were like him!
