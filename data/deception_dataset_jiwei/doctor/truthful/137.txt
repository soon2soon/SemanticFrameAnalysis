I strongly recommend Dr. Richards!  I consulted with seven surgeons and one skin care specialist and did lots of research on-line before selecting him.   He spent a lot of time with me discussing options, giving me candid opinions without making unrealistic promises and without pushing procedures I wasn't interested in.  I felt he really listened and genuinely cared about meeting my needs.   He was very patient with my questions and invited me to call anytime, before and after surgery - which I did, and he never made me feel like I was imposing or silly for doing so.  Dr. Richards performed an S lift, upper and lower eyelids, and rhinoplasty.  My surgery was just two weeks ago so the final effect is not yet apparent, but I am already very pleased.  My jawline is again defined, the saggy skin on my jowls and neck is GONE, my lower eyelid area is completely smooth and the appearance of my nose is much improved.   I can't wait to see the final result!
