I absolutely love Dr. Barnardo.  She always remembers my kids names, everything about them even if they are not with me at the time of my appointment.  I phoned her the other day and left a message, she phoned me within 2 hours - most doctors take days.  She is hard to get in to see, that just means she is doing her job well!
