He is so awsome!! I was by chance I found him on the health website, I was actually looking for a female dr. but couln't find one. After I had 2 miscarrages he sent me for many tests. He said most won't do this until after 3. He put me on a drug called prometium because he thought it could help and because of that I have a beautiful baby girl :) He most his practice recently and I'm so glad its still not to far.
