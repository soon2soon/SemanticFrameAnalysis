I would like to lie and tell you that he's a horrible doctor so that less people would go see him and I wouldnt have to wait so long for an appointment but I cant do that becuase he is such a wonderful doctor!!!!! I live in Regina now but drive back to Saskatoon to see him because I cant find another doctor like him in Regina. He is amazing and never makes you fell silly or inferior!
