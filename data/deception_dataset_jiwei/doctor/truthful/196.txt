I had breast augmentation done by doctor hasell in september and although my implants are not the size I originally wanted due to the fact he talked me out of going bigger, he still did a wonderful job. I will be going back in aug. to see him again. Pain was minimal and scarring is barely noticable. Dr.hasell changed my mind on implant size before surgery due to the fact that he said i was too small to go that large so quickly. If thats not a professional doctor i dont know what is
