Dr.Taranow is so patient and kind . He makes everyone that I have sent including myself feel so comfortable. He is an artist at what he does. His opinion is always honest and not with the desire to try and make the most $ out of the case. He truly cares to make the patient happy. I say this with all sincerity and believe me I've met a lot of doctors. You will as I did walk away with a smile and a new boost of confidence.  DM
