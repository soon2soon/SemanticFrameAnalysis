I had a breast augmentation, I am one of his transsexual clients. He had great bedside manners took care of me and told me how things would go. We talked about size and what was invloved. I had seen him 2 years ago to look into having it done and June 7th this past Tuesday is when I had it done. I'm healing very well. I think he did an amazing job and would see him again for any other work. I would recommend him to anyone who wants the best.
