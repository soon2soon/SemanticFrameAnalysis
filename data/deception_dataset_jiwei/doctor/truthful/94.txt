Dr Greyvenstein is a Godsend! We moved to Alberta in May of 2005 and found him shortly thereafter. He has been nothing but wonderful with the care of our family, from our two sons, to my husband (he has Chrones), to my mom (early stage dementia). He always remembers those that are caring for family members and asks how we are handling different situations. I would recommend him without reservation. He does sometimes run a little behind but knowing the care he gives, it's very understandable.
