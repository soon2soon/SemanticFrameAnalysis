Been going to Angela since she started her practice some 20 years ago. She remembers all my interests and family circumstances and always has the time to 'catch up'. A very supportive, personable and relatiable Doctor. A few blips in the staff along the way but now she has a wonderful, caring and patience support team. Angela never rushes me, answers all my questions and works out a plan of care that we're both comfortable with. I appreciate all that she does. LXP
