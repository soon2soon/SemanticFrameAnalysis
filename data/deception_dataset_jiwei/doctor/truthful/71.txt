After leaving my previous doctor in tears because she said I had to see a psychiatrist as there was nothing wrong with me I vowed to find a more understanding doctor. I am very fortunate that Dr. Nave was taking new patients when I began my search. I have fibromyalgia and chronic pain and all the problems that go with it. Dr. Nave does not try to cram too many patients into a day so she has the time to spend and to a listening ear as well as sound medical advice. On a rare occasion when she is running a few minutes late she apologizes for keeping me waiting. We need more doctors like her who are caring for patients first and making money second.
