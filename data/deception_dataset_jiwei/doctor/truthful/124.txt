Dr. Richards did my breast augmentation, and I was so impressed with him that he performed my Rhinoplasty 2 months later. I had no bruising at all from each of the procedures. My experience was phenomenal - my mom referred to him as a miracle worker. He didn't try to sell me anything, but was always gentle, and guided me throughout the consultation. One of the things that impressed me the most was that he called me at night after each of my procedure just to find out how I was doing. You can tell he truely cares about his patients, and of course he is a genuis at work!!!
