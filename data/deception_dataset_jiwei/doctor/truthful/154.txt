I can't say enough good things about her. She is wonderful well-informed, helpful. If she does not know the answer she find it or does a referral to another doctor. She is quite busy delivering babies, but always is good to reschedule people. She absolute wonderful, and treating you wonderful. I can't enough good things about her. If her practice is not taking any patients you know why, because she is a amazing doctor. Also young too, so I grow old with her.
