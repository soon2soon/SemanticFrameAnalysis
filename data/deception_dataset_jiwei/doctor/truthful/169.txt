I just had a breast augmentation surgery with Dr. Silverman a few days ago and I am very very please with the results. He is excellent at what he does and he is very professional. The job was well done and clean. He tells you the truth and what you should expect as the results. I asked him a few questions by e-mail and he answered all of them.  Almonte hospital, where he does the surgery, is great and the staff were really nice. I would highly recommend him. His consultations are free which is kind of nice.
