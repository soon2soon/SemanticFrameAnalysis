I was refered to Dr.Silverman by a friend of mine. 2 years ago, i had a breast reduction (by another surgeon) who did an aweful job, and left my breasts quite deformed.  My consultation with Dr.Silverman was a great success. He answered all my questions, gave his suggestions, and also recommended I get a second opinion. I went in thinking that nothing could be done, and walked out, knowing something could be.  After 1 more visit, I booked my breast augmentation (contradictive I know, but the only thing left to do to make my breasts look normal). The surgery was painless (always a good sign of a great doctor). Within 2 weeks I was back to my old self. I am just upset that our relationship has come to an end for another 10 years (when i will have to get them replaced). He is a great doctor, and really knows what he's talking about.  His staff is wonderful as well.  Brenda (his assistant) really makes you feel comfortable and walks you through all the steps (if your awake).  She's a doll.
