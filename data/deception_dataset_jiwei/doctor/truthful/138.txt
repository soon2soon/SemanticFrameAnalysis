STOP! This is the Doctor you want cutting into your face!  He knows his stuff.  I had my chin implant and mini local anethesia and heard everything he was saying to his intern!!! "I do this "NOW" because I get a better result..." ETC... I had none of the possible side effects to nerve damage - My facae is perfectly balanced... those that had no idea I had anything done remarked that a really looked good... not knowing why!  I am so pleased! You will be too!  Cathe Ford / Catonsville,Maryland / Special Ed. Teacher...
