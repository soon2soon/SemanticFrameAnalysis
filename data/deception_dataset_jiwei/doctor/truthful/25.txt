Angela was the BEST doctor I have ever had!! When I moved north & had to leave her, it was awful. Fifteen years ago during a regular exam she just happened to notice a small mole on my back. She did a biopsy & called me that night to have me in the next day to remove it. Tests later revealed in another 3 months I would have had to have chemo.I found another doctor up here in the north but still miss her dearly!! She also left it open that in the future if I ever needed a second opinion to call & she would see me. She is a doctor that will go above & beyond & her honesty makes her the doctor she is today.
