Me and my family were very fortunate to have Dr. Nave as our family doctor when we resided in Saskatoon. She was everything a doctor should be. Patient, understanding, helpful and knowledeable. Still looking for someone as caring as her in Regina.Keep it up Dr. Nave you are the best at what you do! -The Thirsk Family
