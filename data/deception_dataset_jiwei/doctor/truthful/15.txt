Angie is a sweetheart and always has time to remember family members,she is knowledgable and can speak to you in layman's terms. Having had Angie through my girls growing up has been a bonus as she has always spoken to them in a professional yet friendly manner when they have had questions or concerns that they perhaps weren't comfortable speaking to us about. If only there were more doctors like her available to the public!!!
