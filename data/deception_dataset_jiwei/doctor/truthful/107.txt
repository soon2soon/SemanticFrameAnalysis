We have recently moved to Saskatchewan from Calgary and we really miss Dr. Greyvenstein! He is an amazing doctor and just as great of a person. He genuinely cares about his patients and what is happening in their lives. He always takes the time to listen and never rushes you out the door. He delivered out first baby and I couldn't have asked for anyone better to do so. We regret that he won't be able to deliver number two when the time comes. We have been spoiled by having such a great doctor in Calgary and now we just can't find one that compares in Regina.
