I first met Dr.Viviers in the OR when having my 4th child via C-section at the Stony Plain Hospital 6 years ago. He came highly recommended from Dr. Stonehocker, another wonderful doctor. I am very lucky I was able to become his patient. Like everyone else said, he takes the time for every question. NEVER makes you feel rushed. I find when I do have to wait to see him it doesn't bother me as much because you know he is just "helping" another patient, and answering all their questions. A few weeks ago he was an hour behind and I had a few questions to ask him and I told him I would ask them another time when he isn't so busy. He said nope ask what you need, when you are an hour behind what's a few more minutes! lol Never makes me feel like he has more important people to see. When you are his patient you ARE the most important patient!
