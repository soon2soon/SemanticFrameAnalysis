I'm SUPER pleased with Dr. Taranow's work. His attention to detail was the reason I felt so comfortable going to him for my transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation. He did amazing work!! In fact, my boyfriend of 4 years still doesn't even suspect I had them done. He constantly tells me I was born with the best breasts on Earth!  I also like how Dr. Taranow wasn't pushy about going bigger than what would look good with my frame. Not to mention the surgery left absolutely no scarring on my armpits. TIPS:I STRONGLY recommend taking the Arnica and Bromelain-it helps significantly reduce inflammation which helps the healing process. NO smoking as negatively affects circulation and you need optimal circulation to heal properly. I'd also stay away from alcohol at least 1-2 wks after surgery. Alcohol negatively affects your immune system and triggers inflammation in the body. A strong immune system will prevent infections. Use Dr. T and follow the guidelines,you won't be disappointed!!
