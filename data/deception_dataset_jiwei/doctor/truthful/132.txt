Dr Richards is the best!  A wonderful, caring, and skilled surgeon.  He took all the time I needed to talk through the procedure, alternatives, risks and expected results.  The results are fantastic and the follow-up care has been excellent.  His office personnel are very responsive and helpful and the nurses and other health providers at the surgery center were outstanding!
