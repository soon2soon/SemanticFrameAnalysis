Could not ask for a better doctor. I moved into his practicing area just over a year and a half ago and have been greatly pleased with his demeanor, knowledge, care, punctuality and decisions. I just had my first child with the midwives and have been pleased with Dr G's care afterwards. Just wonderful. We look forward to many more years of care from him.
