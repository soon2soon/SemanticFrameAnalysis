I love Dr. Bernardo!!!! She delivered my second son and was so helpful in the hospital. She wasn't in a hurry to discharge us and was very empathetic. She has a great bedside manner and obviously loves what she does. I love all of the Drs. in that clinic...Dr. Barnardo invited me to contact her at the clinic at any time if I had any questions or concerns!!! She is a one in a million doctor.
