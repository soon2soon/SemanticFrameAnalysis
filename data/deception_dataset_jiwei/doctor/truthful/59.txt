Dr. Nave has always been a very careing doctor, she takes her time to actually listen to her patients. She is very thoual, and concerned about all as if you were family.She has listened to my problems and acted on them where other doctors have just scrugged their shoulders and treated me for something else. I have had problems in the past with my knee and she was the only doctor that actually got me into a specialist to find out what the problem was.She is the most down to earth doctor I have ever met, which makes it very easy to talk to. Of all the doctor's I have ever gone to Dr. Nave is the best, and I would recommend her to anyone I talk to.
