I have been Dr. Ayling's patient for more than 5 years, my husband for more than 20 and I think he is a wonderful doctor. Attentive and honest. Excellent and emphatic bedside manners. Cares for his patients. Yes, sometimes you have to wait long, but this is because he takes the time for his patients.
