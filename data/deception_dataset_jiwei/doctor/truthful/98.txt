Dr.Greyvenstein just delivered our third child and I feel so blessed to have found such a wonderful doctor. He has this ability to make me feel comfortable in an otherwise uncomfortable setting. He is also wonderful with my other children. He has quickly and accurately diagnosed any conditions that required treatment. What a nice opportunity this is to say something positive about a man who truly deserves it. Thank you Dr. Greyvenstein!
