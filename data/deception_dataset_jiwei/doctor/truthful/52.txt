Dr Forrest, performed a facial repair From an accident. I had a Lefort 3 injury. This is a very seroius injury and usually you do not survive.He rebiult my face with hardware (bolt/plates/screws) from photos my family had given him. Most people who meet me or know me could not believe what I look like. It is very hard if not impossible to see any impurfections, he is a master and I owe my life to him. In business or life the first thing people look at is your face; I have no ill effects whether pain or visual issues. Many times I am told that I am very good looking man and no one believes me the surgery I had unless they see the x-rays. Just a compentent Doctor who is an artist to put something so broken back together. Words cannot descibe how I feel, thanks to Dr. Forrest and the team at sunnybrook hospital. This injury took place in 1994, it has been 17 years and I feel great. Bill Armstrong
