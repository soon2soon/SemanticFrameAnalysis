Dr. Forrest and his surgery staff at sick kids are simple the best.  He has helped my daughter gain confidence in the work that he has done for her.  She has arthritis and as a result her jaw and ears needed work. It is hard to trust anyone with your child especially when it comes to plastic surgery however Dr. Forrest is absolutely wonderful, and if you are lucky enough to get him you are in good hands.
