i really like Dr. nave she's very understanding and take time with a person, gets to the root of a person's problem or refers you to a specialists just wish she didn't have so many patients i guess it's because everybody just likes her so much, and she's a very thorough Dr.  i feel like i can say anything to her as she listens and a very caring dr. wish all Dr.would be like her, such a soft hearted person, no wonder she has so many patients.
