I am very lucky that I found Dr. Kriegler. I agree with the others on here that he is an amazing physician. I have been seeing him for many years now and he never fails to disappoint. No matter what my concern is or how anxious I might be, he always listens to me and addresses my concerns. I do think that he is one of the best doctors in the city. The only wish I have is that I could easily make appts for him as he has extremely limited appointments (most people see him through a first come/first served wait).
