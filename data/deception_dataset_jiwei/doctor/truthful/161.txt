Amazing Dr. Delivered my 3 children, and was not late for that! He is kind, patient, a great listener and is honest. He even stayed behind so we could see him with my sons severe ear-infection until we got off our ferry.(He even came to Children's hospital to make sure we were getting seen.) Yes, even though we now live in the Gulf Islands, Grant is still our Dr. and we wouldn't have it any other way. Your the best.
