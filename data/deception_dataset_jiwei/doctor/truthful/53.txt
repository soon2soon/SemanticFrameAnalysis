Dr.Forrest is extremely top notch! A wonderful, doctor & person! He did amazing work on my son, and we were so lucky to have him! Terrific bedside manner - very friendly with a great personality! He definitely puts happiness into your day - when all is grim! He explains everything in detail and we trust him completely! We agree that he is "heaven sent." If only there were more doctors like him - the world would be a great place! He deserves a "10" score!
