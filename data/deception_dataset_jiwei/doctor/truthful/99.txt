I LOVE Dr G. After moving to Clagary and finding out I was pregnant, finding him was an answer to prayer. He was gentle and thorough with me all during my pregnancy. Since my son was born, he quickly discovered his milk allergy and reflux problem and teated him accordingly. He recognized my symptoms of post partum depressionand sympathetically treated and counselled me through. When he heard that my husband had been laid off from his job he even knew of another position and recommended him for it even though my husband ended up going in another direction. Dr G is not only an exceptional physician but an incrediable human being as well. His hands truly have been blessed by the hand of God. I hope my and my husbands jobs never take us away from Calgary because giving him up as a Doctor would be a huge loss to my family. We love you Dr. G.
