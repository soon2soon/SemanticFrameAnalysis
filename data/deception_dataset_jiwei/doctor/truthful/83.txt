Dr. Taranow knows and is very good at his work i've gone to him 3 times and one time was to correct a abdominal procedure that another doctor did and each time he did an excellent job.I also recommended 5 people to which they all love his work. He may be a little more expensive than other doctors but you will definatly get monies worth.
