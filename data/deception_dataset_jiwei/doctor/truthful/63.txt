Absolute greatest Dr. She very much cares for all her patients. She is empathetic, but at the same time very firm. She is very clear in articulating that a person needs to take care of their body. At the same time she did not make me feel guilty for some of the abuse that I put my body through. Only problem is the office staff who repeatadly have discussions about inappropriate topics. Perhaps it is just me, but their topics of discussion have made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed several occassions. Regardless I tolerate the BS of the office staff to see the greatest physician.
