My surgery went smoothly.  Dr. Richards took very good care of me -- I felt I could contact him at any time and he was right about what I needed to do....I was out and about in less than two weeks.  He is not only a fine doctor but a very nice individual.I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a good plastic surgeon.
