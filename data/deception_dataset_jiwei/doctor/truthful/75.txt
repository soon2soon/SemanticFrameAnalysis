This is a fantastic doctor!!!  I went to him b/c I had already had two capsular contractures since my previous breast augmentation.  He was very helpful, patient, and answered all of my questions.  I quickly scheduled my surgery, and I am beyond happy with the results.  I will definitely be using him again the future!!
