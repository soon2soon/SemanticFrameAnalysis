dr. viviers is an extremely intelligent and caring doctor.he is a part of our family and is welcomed in our life anytime.dr.viviers has helped me mentally and physically,when another dr.missed diagnosed me for 10 years;francois viviers found out what my symptoms were in such a small amount of time;less than 8 months.he has helped me and my son ever since.my son has been through testing for strep throat and ear infections so much that eventually with confidence dr.viviers reassured me that he would be okay.i rated his timing a 4 but i would wait forever just to get into see him.i know he might be behind a little because he actually takes the time to sit and talk to you,and listen to everything you have to say.ours lives are better with him and we want to thank dr.viviers for the gifts he has given us and to his other patients he serves.this is his calling,thank you doctor. sincerely tamara and mitchell dedla.
