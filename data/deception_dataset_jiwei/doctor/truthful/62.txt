Dr. Nave has been my Doctor for about 9 years now. I don't get to see her very often and sometimes I have maybe not been the best patient, but I appreciate everything she has done for me and been extremely satisfied with all the answers she has given me in the past. Her staff has always been excellent at "fitting me in" if needed. Overall Dr. Nave is a wonderful physician and I consider myself to be very lucky to have her as my healthcare provider.
