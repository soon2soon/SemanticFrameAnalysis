Dr.Barnardo is one of the best physicians that I have come across in a long time. I hate going to the doctor and she has a way of just putting you at ease. She treats you as a person and if it takes a few extra mins to help you out she takes the time. All docotors should take a lesson from this woman. And if she cant help you she wastes no time in sending you to someone who can.
