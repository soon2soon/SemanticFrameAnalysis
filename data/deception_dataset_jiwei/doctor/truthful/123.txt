I highly recommend Dr. Richards.  I was impressed by his low pressure approach to explaining my surgical options.  He was completely professional as he demonstrated kindness, dedication, and great skill.  He performed my eyelid surgery and later removed my old breast implants with capsular contracture and replaced them.  Dr. Richards is an exceptional surgeon whom I highly recommend as I could not imagine being more pleased with the outcomes of both of my procedures. His staff was wonderful.
