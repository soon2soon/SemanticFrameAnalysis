went to him for lipo/body sculpting on arms, lower back, abdomen, inner/outer thighs.  My results were incredible, better than I ever expected! And lasted for almost 3 yrs before putting some of the curves back on, mostly bc of bad diet.  I was very pleased and am going back to him for my 2nd surgery for touch ups on the initial liposuction.  I highly recommend him
