For over 20 years Dr. M-W has been a wonderful and perceptive Dr. She even found a genetic disease which no one else bothered to question in my 60+ years but what a difference it has made.Whenever you had an appt. you were made to feel as a friend. As friends do we had a horrible misundestanding through no fault of hers. Never at that time could she have known what a horror story the next 9 hours would be... in another health care facility. The nightmares are unbearable. I ..do not have a family physician nor will I. The utmost in professionalism cannot be matched...and I wish the very best for her.
