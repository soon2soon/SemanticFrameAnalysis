LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this doc! My son was always afraid of the doctor but ever since we started to see Dr. G, he looks forward to his appointments! He is AMAZING with children, has a great sense of humor, super understanding, thorough and EXTREMELY knowlegeable. I called all of my neighbors and told them about him right after our first visit and now half of the block goes to see him! We NEVER feel rushed, he ALWAYS takes the time to answer all of your questions no matter how silly they are.
