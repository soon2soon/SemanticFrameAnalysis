We moved from California and landed in Calgary as immigrants. We feel very fortunate to have Dr. Greyvenstein who took very nice care during my pregnancy and baby's birth. I was nervous being a first time mom and the very first meeting with doctor made me comfortable and determined. We can't thank doctor enough for the care he took and for his subordinates at Rockyview Hospital and ofcourse not to forget the helpful and welcoming staff at the clinic.
