Dr. Forrest is an amazingly talented physician who does incredible work. He performed an extensive surgery on our beautiful little boy and the results were simply unbelievable. Our friends and family couldn't believe we had undergone such a major surgery. As were discussing our son's CatScans after the surgery, I looked at his hands realizing what they had done and said to him May God give you the strength and steadiness in your hands and the sharpness and brilliance of mind to continue performing miracles for all who need them. We are truly blessed to have a World renowned Doctor of his caliber at Sick Kids hospital. A heartfelt Thank You to Dr. Forrest and his amazing staff for all their remarkable life's work and making a very stressful time somewhat more bearable.
