Who knew that a brew tour would be so exclusive? My fiance and I had really been wanting to check this one out and after looking at their website, we saw that going to this tour was going to take some planning. They only have one tour, which is on a Saturday at 11am. Sounds simple enough. Except that they only take 60 people and if you're 61, it's a no-go for you. I read a bunch of Yelp reviews and an article on the tour and saw that getting there around 9:30-9:45 was the best bet. So we hopped on an early Metra from the burbs, found parking pretty easily in the neighborhood (free if you can get it), and walked up to the somewhat non-existent line. We were fourth and fifth in line. Woot! We got there at 9:40 and the line built up pretty quickly after that. I'd say by 10:15, we were at or near 60 people. About half hour later, one of the brew dudes came around handing out golden tickets (literally) as your pass to get in. The late birds sadly left the line. At 11, we were let in and paid the $10 fee and handed a pint glass. This is your tasting glass, my friends. We were also given three tokens to trade in for a full beer during the tour. I had my first glass right before the tour started and the next two during and after. We also got a free sampling of a firkin that they had. The tour was great. The dude explained everything I've heard a million times by now on other tours as far as the brewing process goes, but it's always fun to hear other people tell it, and how they got started. I was buzzin a bit by the time the tour let out, but we had a lot of fun and I'd definitely come back to Half Acre, as I did not have a chance to hang out in the tap room. Oh and the beers were awesome. Nothing better than a fresh beer made on the premises.
