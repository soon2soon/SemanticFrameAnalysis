I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. They seem to have all the basics covered: clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff, a pretty respectable hotel continental breakfast, and amazing location. This was my first time in Chicago and issues at your hotel can ruin a city's perception for you. I'm incredibly glad this was not the case for me. When I return to Chicago, this Cleveland boy will definitely stay at this hotel again. The only small negatives I can think of was a lackluster wifi and our room was slightly smaller than I would prefer. These are not deal breakers and I would gladly return.
