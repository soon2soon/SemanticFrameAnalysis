This is my first stay at this hotel, and I'm very impressed. The check in staff was fantastic and every employee Â I've encountered here has been friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great, central location. My room is well laid out and most importantly seems spotlessly clean. The furnishings are modern but not overly trendy, and there are four, count 'em four!, electrical outlets next to the bed. (Nothing is more annoying than having no outlet near the bedside table!) I definitely look forward to staying here in the future.
