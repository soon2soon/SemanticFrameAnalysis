We had the BEST time on the Chocolate Tour! Our guide, Greg Fairbanks, was helpful and fun, and made everyone feel at ease right away. He was very knowledgeable about the food scene in town, and gave great backstories at each stop along the way. We went to Glazed and Infused, West Town Bakery, Vosges, L'Apetito, and More Cupcakes, and each stop was more delicious than the last. I am so glad my best girlfriends and I got to take part in this fun tour today! I would recommend it to anyone who loves good food and a good time.
