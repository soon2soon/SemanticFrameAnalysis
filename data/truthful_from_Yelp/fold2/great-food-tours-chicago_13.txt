My friends and I purchased the tickets for the Great Food Tour through Groupon and thought, hey, for $20, if it sucks, we'll just walk off the tour.  Not the case!     We were greeted by our tour guide Jason at the meeting spot and immediately could tell he was fun - super easy going and friendly.  By the first stop, we knew we had made a critical error: eating lunch first.  There was so much food!  Not being from Chicago, it was a great way to not only sample food but also find out about restaurants we normally would not have tried (or known existed).  Pizza, hot dogs, pretzels, tacos, paninis, cupcakes - all delicious!   We never felt rushed at any of the spots and there was even time to order and enjoy margaritas with our tacos.  By the end of the tour, we literally had a bag full of food to take with us (and due to the smell of the leftover Chicago hotdogs, I'm sure the fridge in our hotel room will never be the same).  Also, I can't rave enough about Jas (yes, after being with him for just mere moments, we decided we were close enough to give him a nickname like we were old chums - that's just how much fun he was).  I would definitely recommend!
