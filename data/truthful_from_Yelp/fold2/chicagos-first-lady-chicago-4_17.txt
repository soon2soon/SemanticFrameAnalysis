I'm so glad we did this! It's a 90 minute excursion down the Mississippi River with a knowledgable docent from the Chicago Architecture Foundation. It's a wonderful way to see the beautiful architecture of Chicago and learn a lot about it too. It's also a great vantage point for taking excellent pictures! It's $40 per person but definitely think it's worth it. Several tours each day so just walk up and book. You may have some trouble getting in if you're booking on the weekend but weekday tours seem to be pretty open. There is a bartender on board if you need it to make it more interesting!
