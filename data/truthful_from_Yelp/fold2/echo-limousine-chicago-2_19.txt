A+++ experience in in Chicago! Very professional service from the online booking to the airport drop-off. Everything went smooth. Usually I won't take a limo for personal travel but I decided to give it a shot after reading Yelp's reviews on other low-cost shuttles and car services in Chicago if I wanted to catch my plane on time with no disappointments. And I am so glad that I did! I received a confirmation email ahead of time and on their website they already indicated that they would charge customers 20% gratuity including 10 bucks extra to their billing due to early service (between midnight and 5 or 6 AM, a common rule in Chicago). The customer service of the staff over the phone was so-so though. Other than that, everything else was perfect. Our driver was professional and friendly. The limo was spacious and super clean. We arrived at the airport on time. Highly recommend this company!
