Not being a fan of trolleys, I wanted something a little different (and awesome) for this year's birthday bar crawl, and ChiTown Party Bus had the perfect vehicle. We rented their "VooDoo Daddy Bus" which is a blacked-out converted school bus that can only be described as "badass." One can only assume it was the bus that drove Chuck Norris to/from elementary school (or maybe Chuck drove himself to elementary school on this bus); it's that awesome. This land yacht is all-party inside and out. The interior was spacious and had an incredible sound system (w/ iPhone input), THREE dance poles, a TV, and massive insulated cooler that handled an extremely large quantity of beer and ice (they even provided the ice). Overall, the service was first class. Our driver arrived early, was incredibly friendly, handled every one of our drunken route suggestions like a pro (and even suggested some fun alternatives that we didn't know about), always texted his location to me while we were in the bars, and not once showed an ounce of impatience, despite how obnoxious our group was or when we blasted the stereo. Honestly, could not have asked for a better birthday. These guys rock.
