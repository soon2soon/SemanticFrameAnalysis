A really neat boat to be cruising down the Chicago River in. A little dingy, but what do you expect. If you really want a full experience, sit on the top deck outside and brave the elements -- heat or cold! Otherwise, there's an indoor parlor downstairs (with a bar!) where you can sit and enjoy your tour.
