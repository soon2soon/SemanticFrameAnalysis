I have rented from Gameday Housing for three years and have been extremely impressed by their professionalism and service.  They have worked hard to get our group into the best place possible.  A couple years ago I told Wes what type of house we wanted and he kept me updated when one came online.  Last year he offered a recommendation for a home that I otherwise wouldn't have considered, and it was spot on.   This is a company you can feel safe doing business with. And it's just a great way to get your group together.  I'm surprised to read Ellen's review--I've had a completely different experience.  It sounds like maybe she shouldn't have been renting if she wasn't comfortable with how renters might (legally) behave.  It's unfortunate, but not really the company's fault.
