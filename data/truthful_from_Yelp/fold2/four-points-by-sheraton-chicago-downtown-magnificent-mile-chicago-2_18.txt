We stayed at the Four Points for a few days while we had our floors done - we (4 of us, incl. kids age 10& 13) were hoping to have a local mini-vacation.  We basically picked the Four Points based on the neighborhood and the price, but the hotel itself was great!! I wanted to get a King Suite for us adjacent to a two bed room for our girls.  Corporate does all the reservations, and would not let me just reserve that combination, and I got into a hassle with them.  I finally spoke to the desk in Chicago, and the reservation person there told me to go ahead and get two rooms and she would basically override Corporate and make sure we got what we wanted.  And that is exactly what she did - we had great rooms. Staff were very friendly, not downtown stuffy at all.  They welcomed our kids - the door guy and desk people recognized them by the second day we were there and would welcome them personally, ask what they had done that day, etc.  The kind of treatment you expect at a small hotel in Europe. Room was great, nice views, location is absolutely 100%.  The windows actually open!!!   It has a really great pool that has a glass roof, so when we took our kids there during the day there was lots of sun streaming through.  Pretty good workout room - basic machines, all in good shape, with televisions. My only gripe is that the pillows are bad.  Down filled, but small and thin.  Mattress was fine, rooms were good sized with good flat screens, so I was surprised at the pillows (although at least they were not Holiday Inn foam!). I would go back for sure.
