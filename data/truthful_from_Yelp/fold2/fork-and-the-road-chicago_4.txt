This is a fantastic way to see Chicago and eat at some excellent establishments you might not otherwise know about. A great activity for tourists, but I'd just as soon recommend Fork and the Road for fellow city-dwellers. You don't have to be an avid foodie or an avid cyclist for it to be accessible, either! Sharon and Dimitra are excellent tour guides on the street and in the restaurants alike; they know their routes and they really know their food! Â I joined the tour alone, and the other riders were friendly and fun to spend the afternoon with. Fork and the Road offers a truly unique and thoroughly enjoyable way to experience Chicago! I'll be back.
