I used Fivewest Chauffeur to take a group of friends out for night on the town for my birthday. The vehicle (Mercedes party bus- seats 10) was impeccable. Very classy, clean and comfortable with a flat screen TV and hook ups for about any media you can think of.  Ryan was a great chauffeur, extremely profession, nice and helpful. I  highly recommend this service for a special event or even to just make a regular night out more fun.
