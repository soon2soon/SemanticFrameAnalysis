This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at!!! Why??? They use a tap card system for the card keys for the doors. Just put your card on top of the sensor on the door to your room and poof you are in. This is much better than the swipe system used at most other hotels and certainly all other Marriotts which I have stayed at. Those cards are always getting demagnetized. Everything else about the hotel is great too! The showers have good water pressure!
