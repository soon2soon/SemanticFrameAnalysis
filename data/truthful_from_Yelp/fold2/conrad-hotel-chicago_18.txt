When you think of a 5 star hotel you might think of the Plaza in NYC.   It's not 5 stars in that sense but it offers 5 star amenities. Chilled towels in the fitness center, free wireless printing, clean towels and more water bottles delivered to the room each evening make this a really nice hotel.   The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are extra large.   This is a really really nice hotel....prob 1/2 step below the Waldorf.   Well done Hilton !
