By rating this five stars, I do not mean to  imply that it is a Grand 5 star hote;.  It is a very good well run downtown hotel with economical rates.  My expense account allows me to stay anywhere within reason, and I always choose Club quarters because I like the atmosphere.  The rooms are small, but very well appointed and squeeky clean--rather like those of a first rate Japanese hotel.  The resteraunt is first rate and accommodating, and there are pleasant computer equipped lounges, and a well equipped excercise room.  The staff always smiling and helpful.
