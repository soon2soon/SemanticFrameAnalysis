My mom had never been to Chicago before so when I went for work, I flew her to join me.  Right before she came, she hurt her knee so that meant we had to change previous plans.  We couldn't walk too far so what could we do?  I decided to look online for things to do and came upon this!  My mom (in her 60s) is a nervous type person and I had to tell her over and over it would be fine.  Sure enough, it was better than fine. She had SO MUCH fun and tells me about it, even a month later.  So glad we did this!  John and Casey were the BEST!  Thank you guys for everything!!  You made these New Mexico folks so happy!!  (We were there May 9, 2014)   DO IT! You won't regret it!!
