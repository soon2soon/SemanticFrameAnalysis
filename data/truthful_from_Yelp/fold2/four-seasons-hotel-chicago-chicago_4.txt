I'll live here one day and just be rude to children in the elevator, eat Wagyu for breakfast every morning, and buy a new pair of underwear from Bloomingdales downstairs. Had a great suite with a view of the water. Wind never got too loud but the creaking can be much, so have a few drinks before you go to bed.
