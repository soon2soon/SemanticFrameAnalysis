This review is for the catering team - Annie, Rebecca, and Tomasz, specifically. They made our wedding day/weekend so unforgettable, I feel so grateful to have dealt with them.  Every single detail was absolute perfection, and we could not have asked for or dreamed up a better wedding. They were there to make sure we were happy with everything, to make sure the service was perfect, and that the presentation was impeccable.  Also, I always had a glass of champagne in my hand - not sure where it came from, but all I know is it showed up on a silver platter whenever I was empty-handed in the drink department.... if there is some way to make that happen every time I go out, that would be great! ;) KIDDING! All in all, it was pure perfection, and I loved working with them :)
