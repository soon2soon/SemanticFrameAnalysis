Very good location close to the el stop, shopping, restaurants and bars. They have free breakfast daily and every room (except one, room 1000 I think) is a two room suite. I never pay to park here though; it's like $55/day. I use spot hero app and park in the garage across the street; it's usually around $22/day. Anyway, the staff here are always friendly. My only complaints, other than the parking, is the slow elevators and the tv is satellite, so when it rains the service goes out. Other than that, you won't be disappointed.
