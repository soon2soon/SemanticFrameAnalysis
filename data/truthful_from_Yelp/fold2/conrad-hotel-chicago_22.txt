Amazing hotel!! I stayed there with a conference in April and they took great care of the hotel. I ended up coming down with bonchitis during my stay, and they had a doctor on call who was able to come to my room and assist me. The next day all of the staff were so helpful to me. Very well managed hotel, rooms were very spacious, restaurant and bar was acceptable though the terrace wasn't open during my stay. I would definetely go again should I stay in Chicago
