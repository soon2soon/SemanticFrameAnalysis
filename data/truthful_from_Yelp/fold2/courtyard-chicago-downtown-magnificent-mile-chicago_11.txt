I love the hotel.  The room was basic, but the service was great.  The staff was very attentive.  The room rates were actually better than other hotels in the area, due to the Chicago marathon.  I received my points and perks.  The hotel is close to the train as well as lots of restaurants and bars.  Don't get me started on the donuts in the shop attached to the hotel!  Crazy good!!!  The hotel is also right across the street from Andy's Jazz club, one of my favorite spots in Chicago.
