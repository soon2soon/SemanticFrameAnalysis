Extremely high value for the price. Standard hotel room and facilities, exactly like every other Courtyard. But the staff is accommodating, extremely nice and the location superb. Easy access to Mag Mile and Gold Coast, ten min walk to Millennium Park, and buses all the time on Michigan Ave to northern and southern neighborhoods. It is not convenient to CTA trains however. I stay here most times I am in Chicago.
