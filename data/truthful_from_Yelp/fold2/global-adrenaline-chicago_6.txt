Global Adrenaline (GA) planned an awesome trip to Machu Picchu and the Amazon for 11 of us.  We debated whether to plan the trip ourselves or have GA plan it for us.  I'm really glad that we went with GA. some of the awesome... * Everything was extremely organized.  None of us had to think about logistics, and we spent all our time enjoying the actual Inca Trail, food, the city, the culture - the reasons why we actually went to Peru. * The Guides - First off, our initial local guide got sick and was hospitalized.  GA was able to find us a new head guide immediately.  The new guide was just as awesome as the first.  Secondly, these guides are not some Joe they hire off the street.  These are highly educated and extremely knowledgeable guides.  Ours was an ecotourism professor at the local university who has given talks in the US.  Not only that, they were fun, had great stories, and got along with our group so well.  My friend (who didn't go with GA) but did the same trip did not learn nearly half the things that we did. * On the day we had to depart for our 4 day hike, the government was shutting down roads for some strike that was going on in the city.  GA was up to date with the news and made us leave extra early to make sure we arrived at our hike on time.  If we did not, we could have gotten stuck in the middle of the strikes and not been able to hike the Inca Trail. (since they only allow a certain amount of permits per day) * One person in our group got a intolerable toothache.  GA and the guides personally found him a legitimate dentist and took him to the office during their off hours. We had an extremely great and safe trip.  I highly recommend GA if you are planning a trip internationally.  They will plan the A to Z and have plans for the unexpected, which inevitably always happens when traveling.
