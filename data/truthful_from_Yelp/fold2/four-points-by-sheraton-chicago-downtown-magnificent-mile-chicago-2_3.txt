Hotel Rush My boyfriend and I stayed two nights and it was awesome. The woman who checked me in was so friendly and they greeted us every time we came back in from going out. I asked for a newly renovated room and she was happy to give me one. We got a room on the 8th floor the view wasn't that great but it's a smaller hotel so I didn't expect an awesome view. The location is perfect. I made our hotel reservations on groupon and there were no problems. As far as house keeping coming in unexpectedly this never happened to us. I look forward to staying again.
