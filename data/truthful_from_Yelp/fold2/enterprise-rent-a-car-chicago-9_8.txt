No longer car-free, but still rent cars once in a while, and Enterprise on Kedzie still delivers. John, the manager, is the epitome of quality customer service. I'd mistakenly left some reusable insulated grocery bags in a car that I returned. They'd rented the car quickly after to another family, but John called them and had them drop off my bags, which I picked up a day later. Thanks so much!
