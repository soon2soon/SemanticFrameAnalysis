After the bad weather in Illinois with tornadoes in East Peoria, I had to rent a car from this facility to drive to Peoria, IL.  Pick-up from the airport was quick. The driver Juan was very friendly. There was a loooong line of people there but I was very impressed by the efficiency of the staff. They  distributed bottled water to the people in the line which was a very welcoming and pleasant gesture. The staff was able to get all of us quickly on our way without any fuss. Definitely the best customer service I have had while renting a car, all the more enjoyable given the torture I had gone through before getting to O'hare on 11/17/2013!
