Amazing service! Steve was our driver for the day. We spent a day in Chicago with very specific places we wanted to go to. Steve was incredibly professional and engaging and really created a memorable experience for myself and my son. He maintained excellent communication from the moment he arrived to pick us up and throughout our trip at every stop. Additionally, he always managed to find the closest available spot to pick us up which seems impossible in Chicago, but he made it happen. Rates were also very reasonable for the trip. I have high standards and expectations and Echo limousine exceeded every one of them. From reservation, to driving, to the impeccably kept vehicle we traveled in itself. I should also note that I had anticipated a standard and somewhat boring Lincoln sedan, but we traveled in an elite MKZ SUV. Again, impeccably kept, shiny and luxe in all the right places. Echo, I look forward to our future business together and we will definitely be requesting Steven again next time!
