A gem in the heart of the loop!  I was able to book a standard room (smallish with a comfy queen) on hotels.com for $99 a night.  Self-parking at a nearby lot (no in-n-out privileges, but you do not want to drive in this city) was only $20 per day with validation.  There are coffee makers in the room, the hotel is very quiet, and the staff is very helpful and most welcoming.  I don't spend much time in my room in a city like Chicago, but it was a great place to lay my head at night and get ready for another day.  Plus, it is an easy ride on the Orange line from Midway Airport.
