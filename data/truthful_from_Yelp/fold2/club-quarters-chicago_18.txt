Incredible location.  This is the second Club Quarters I have stayed in (St. Paul's, London--also excellent), and I love them. Small rooms, mine had lots of windows on the 32nd floor, efficient, and perfect for someone or a couple that wants to see the city.   Great for business travelers as well.  Bring your own conditioner (I guess they like frizzy heads).  Internet is great, my Sprint phone had problems on the 32nd floor.  Coffee at Cafe Intelligentsia is worth the walk.
