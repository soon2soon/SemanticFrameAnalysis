I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a Porsche Boxster rental for his birthday. Global was outstanding, responding to my email inquiry within the hour and getting everything set up for the rental only two days in advance! It worked where I was the primary renter and I added him as a second driver (so I wouldn't need to ask him for his information and ruin the surprise). All they needed from him was his license number, exp. date and car insurance info which they were able to take the day of. The process was flawless -- they dropped it off for free and we were driving with the top down 20 minutes later. We had 100 miles included and thought we would go over and I was prepared to spend the 75Â¢ per extra mile but we were under, and we drove it everywhere! (all the way up Sheridan road and back to the south end of LSD). We had it ready to return with a full tank for Global to pick it up again the next day. I asked what to do if the weather was bad on our rental day and they said I had a year to use the credit if we had to cancel. I would definitely rent from them again! (if my boyfriend weren't already shopping for his own Porsche).
