Talk to Emily.  I'm so used to being ignored or yelled at by hostile customer service staff in Chicago that I brace myself and put on my game face before I walk into a 7-11 or a gas station or a Target, etc.  Emily actually introduced herself and shook my hand when I walked in.  I was so thrown off that I didn't know how to respond.  She had been working with another customer as I was waiting and was trying incredibly hard to help her get the right documentation so she could rent a car.   She offered to help her find something online and seemed genuinely sorry that the woman didn't have enough ID.  Anyway, the car I'd requested wasn't back yet so she gave me a double upgrade for free and chatted for a while about how much she likes meeting new people at her job.  Anyone who can get that much joy from working at a car rental company would be someone I'd want on my staff.  It was just amazing to meet someone so caring and considerate in the customer service industry!!
