The perfect venue for AMERICAN EXPRESS' OPEN FORUM: CEO BOOTCAMP that meets the modern demands of a conference with live online streaming. Â Professional Media Crew captures the speakers in the best angle and light. BOX LUNCH -- healthy, plentiful and balance. COFFEE AND TEA -- always available and hot with all the available options (cream, whole milk, skim milk, soy). APPETIZERS AND DRINKS -- excellent food selections that it became my dinner.
