Fullerton Red Line station - I love that you feel safe at night. I love that there is a CTA employee there, even on a Sunday! It was cold and I wasn't far from home. And your train came in 5 minutes. I love that there is so much near you. A Dominick's. A Starbucks. Nice. I love that connecting bus lines stop right in front and will take me to my door! YOU ROCK! Public transportation is cheaper, more green and relatively more efficient than automobile transport. It is also inconvenient at times and the clientele can be challenging. But, you know what? I'll take it ANY day over sitting on LA's freeways or taking the buses and few trains there. Ya'll are spoiled. There, I said it. Yeah, you Chicagoans .... oughta try living in LA and getting around without a car. Yea, it can be done. But who the hell would want to? You think these trains area bad? At least you have them. I live in an area of the city where every day, I have so many options on how to get where I'm going, it's like a game to figure out which is best. Often, I can just catch the first bus available out of 3 and get to my destination just that quick. Or I can take the train, the bus. The train or the bus. Â  I got so I hardly went anywhere in LA because of the traffic. I pretty much started staying in my neighborhood. Guess what that is? Isolating. Boring. But every time I got into my car to go somewhere, I'd get so aggravated, it just wasn't worth it. I love how you connect with other El trains. You're so well designed! Thank you, again, for being so clean and well-lit!
