Great location, friendly staff, and clean.  The restaurant and bar was open and looked great although I didn't eat there.  I did wander into Glazed and Infused for donuts which was could be accessed via the restaurant. (See related review.)  The exercise room had a great amount of equipment. The pool is rectangular (about 18 yards long) and has one lap lane with a remaining area (about 2 lanes wide). It isn't really a family-friendly pool but it could be use.  Very nice sun deck too. I agree what previous reviewers have said about this hotel (except, as I noted, the restaurant is now open...and I didn't find it too noisy considering it's downtown).  It was my daughter's birthday and they made her feel very special during our stay. Considering the location, price, and accommodations, it's a great place to stay.
