I spent this past weekend at this Marriott, and I have never experienced such amazing customer service anywhere.  When we arrived, our room had not been cleaned, and we were immediately upgraded to a king suite, escorted to our room, and handed a coupon for three free breakfasts.  We were there for my son's wedding, and my whole family stayed there.  My brother has MS, and had not brought a wheelchair.  When we realized that he needed one (on a Saturday afternoon), I called the hotel front desk and spoke to Alex (who I later found out was a security guard there).  He found a place who delivered a wheelchair within half an hour.  It seems that there was nothing they wouldn't do to make our stay exceptional.  The woman who cleaned our room was not only careful and thorough, she greeted us every time we saw her in the hallways.  I felt like I was among friends.  They made our stay exceptional.   The fact that the room wasn't clean was a non-issue because of the way it was handled--with professionalism, promptness, and an obvious desire to provide great service.  It seems that there was not one negative person in the entire place.   When we arrived late Thursday evening,  Mitul was working in the bar, and he too did everything he could to get us food and wine, which we all needed.  As the family continued to arrive from the airport he made sure we knew when the kitchen was closing so that we could order enough food to take care of everyone.   I highly recommend this hotel.  I can't wait to stay there again!
