On-time, and good price for going into the suburbs. Â And exceptional service. The driver was running late due to his previous ride was caught up in customs coming into Chicago. So rather than be 10 minutes late, the owner no less came out (on Thanksgiving!) to pick me up. Really great company who cares about their customers. They are my go to limo service now!
