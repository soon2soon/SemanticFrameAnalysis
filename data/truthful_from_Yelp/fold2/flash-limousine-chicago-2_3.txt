We have rented a limo bus for a birthday party and were totally satisfied. The bus got the pick up location earlier than we expected, it was perfectly clean and the bar area was fully loaded with numerous kind of sodas. The driver, Scott, was a friendly, polite guy and never refused our reasonable requests.(Obviously, there is nothing he can do if anybody wants to smoke in the bus, per our contract) Overall, it was a perfect experience for us! We would highly recommend Flash Limousine.
