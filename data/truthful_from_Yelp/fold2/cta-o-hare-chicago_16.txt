This maybe the second busiest airport in the US but this is how an airport should be designed.  The terminals are laid out in a giant horseshoe with the train station right in the middle.  What could be simpler?  The trains are fast, clean, cheap ($2.25) and efficient.  I never had to wait long for a train.  During the rush hour this is the way to go.  I made the mistake by taking a taxi from the Loop and while sitting in traffic on the Expressway I could see several trains pass us by.  Oh yeah, the cost of the taxi was $50 including tip.  Ouch! LAX, my home town, has a simple U shaped lay out but no easy transportation.  Must take free shuttle buses to Metro Bus Center in Lot C, then take another bus to the Subway Green Line or where ever.  Transportation to and from is cheap $1.75. JFK, what a clusterfuck!  The person that designed this nightmare should be shot.  Public transportation is just like LAX and driving is total hell.  They have on and off ramps that are so confusing.  WTF! NWR the design is similar to O'hare and LAX.  The transit system is easy to use.  However the cost to take the New Jersey Transit to Penn Station is a steep $15.   I love ORD.
