This is by far my favorite CTA line! 1. Always clean. Doesn't smell like someones old laundry (unlike some other lines we know...RED!!!) 2. On time! 3. The stations are well kept/feel safe. Riding the Brown line is one of my "I'm poor but can't bear to sit in my apartment for one more second" activities. I'll board at Montrose with a book and then just ride it around the loop and northbound. Great views of the city. (Don't judge me. You know you do it too)
