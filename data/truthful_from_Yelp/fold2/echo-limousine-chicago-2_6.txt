I have used Echo several times and have never been disappointed.  Eddy my driver is just great.  The passenger front seat is always arranged up close to dashboard giving the passenger (me) plenty of leg room and comfort in the back. I did have an issue with my pick up on March 9 and being seated behind the driver instead of passenger side.  I understand this resulted because of snow, but if driver would have waited on street I could have then had access to the rear passenger side instead of seated behind the driver.  Could I have said something, sure, but because this was post surgical doctor visit I just didn't have it in me to get out of car and move to other side.  A single passenger should never have to sit behind the driver.  I will continue to use Echo because the cars are clean, as are the drivers, and the trips are always stress free.  The nicest drivers and dispatchers are at this company.
