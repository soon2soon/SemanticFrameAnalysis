What an experience. Chinatown Ping Tom Park and its "other" hidden secrets. Come on now, not many people I speak to ever know of Ping Tom, but what about the whole water taxi thing? I am impressed. For $7 you get an all day pass! The partner and I took the "water taxi" from Chinatown Ping Tom Park to Madison then transferred to another awaiting water taxi and that lead us closer to Navy Pier. Well once you get off on Rush and Illinois I believe, you walk up the ramp, walk 2 blocks north and there you get a free trolley to the pier. That is really a nice thing to have in Chicago. And how come I didn't know about this before. I do want to give props to the young guys on the 1st water taxi, seriously! He told us that we had to be back by 7 pm which is technically the last water taxi was going to leave the dock at 7. Well guess what? By the time our other water taxi was docking, our ride to Chinatown (our start point) was already leaving. Although they blew the horn they kept going, but the guys from the first Chinatown Taxi noticed us and came back. I have to really thank them for that because had they not returned, we would of had a long journey back to Chinatown. I think that everyone should check out the water taxi's because it gives you a totally different view of the city and its wonderful skyline. I am now a fan and will definitely return when I want to go to Navy Pier from Chinatown. Awesome!
