The location was accessible, the car excellent like you would expect from BMW, and billing straightforward.  What is worth mentioning is how remarkable the staff was. Saul, Weston, and Lauren helped navigate a difficult interaction with AAA insurance with clear and constant communication, empathy, and big personable smiles.  My experience was so positive that this is the only place I will refer my friends and family to.  Hooray that  amazing service is still alive in the car rental world!
