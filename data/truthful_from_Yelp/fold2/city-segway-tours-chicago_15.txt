Amazing time! I am from Chicago but had a visitor in town - I thought this would be a great way to see the sights and have some fun! I was surprised at how many places I had Â never seen before - our tour guide was amazing and I didn't want the fun to end. I thought that 3 hours would be too long but I was shocked that it flew by so fast! Highly recommended for anyone!
