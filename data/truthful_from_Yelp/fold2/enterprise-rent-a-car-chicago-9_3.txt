First time renting a car and was amazed at how quick and easy the whole thing was.  The price was also cheaper than expected.  I was offered to be picked up but decided to walk that morning.  Car was still nice for being the cheapest option (Nissan Versa).  Was pleasantly surprised that they offered to drive me home, which I took them up on that offer.  Would certainly recommend to others, everyone there is incredibly helpful and nice.
