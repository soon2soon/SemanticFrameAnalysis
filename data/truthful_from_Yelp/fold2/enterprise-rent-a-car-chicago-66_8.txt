5 Stars for a Rental Car Company?  Well... yes.  I travel a lot for business so when a rental car company, hotel, airline, etc., goes above and beyond the average, or is so notable that I remember to tell other people about it, that warrants a great review. I rented a car last month from the Chicago O'Hare location (booked online in advance).  At the airport, I was promptly picked up by the shuttle bus and a *very* friendly and outgoing driver (Tanya) made sure that everyone felt welcome.  If there is any feedback for improvement, it is maybe that Tanya could dial back her friendliness just a click... some people might find it off-putting, I thought it was fine.  I arrived at the car rental agency and was promptly greeted as I stepped off the shuttle, my luggage was brought in for me, and I was handed a cold bottle of water.  Nice!  All of those things show that Enterprise is working hard on giving their customers a great experience.   Once at the counter, I was quickly processed and given my car, my luggage was again brought out to the car for me, and the agent made sure that I understood how to operate the convertible top (free car upgrade!).  When I drove out of the lot, the attendant that checked the rental paperwork was also really friendly and made sure that I knew where I was going. Upon return, I pulled the car into the return lane, and got out.  I was greeted by name, handed a receipt, and my luggage was again taken for me to the shuttle bus.  You can't ask for a better rental car experience than that!
