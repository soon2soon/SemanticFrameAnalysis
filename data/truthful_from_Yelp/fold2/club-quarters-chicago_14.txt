Gotta say, I love the heck out of this hotel.   It's shiny clean, very comfortable despite the minimalist rooms.   Club Quarters are meant to be small boutique hotels that accomodate one or two people max to a room.   If you are expecting more, mayhaps you didn't do your homework.   (Don't complain that it's small... it's supposed to be small!  It was built in the 20s, remember?  Humans didn't need as much room back then.  We didn't have McMansions or The bleedin' Cheesecake Factory in the '20s either, dontcha know...)   So yeah, do not bring your kids here.   But if it's just you traveling on business, go for it. Think about it:  What, as a business traveler, do you need?   1) Clean, super-comfy bed  [Check!] 2) Quiet, clean room with an ergonomically-designed desk / lighting [Check!] 3) Speedy internet access [Check! They have both wired and wireless] 4) Friendly, knowledgeable staff [Checkity-check-check!] 5) Good rates [Check!] 6) Easy to get a cab [Check!] 7) Lots of free coffee that doesn't suck [Check!] 8) TeeVee, with lots o' cable channels [Check!] 9) Mini-fridge and microwave [Check!  Make sure you request it upon arrival, though] 10) Restaurants within walking / delivery distance [Check!] 11) Iron, extra coffee, extra toiletries [In a communal hall closet, which is not at all inconvenient or weird... Check!] The beautiful view of the city / river doesn't hurt, either. I love the understated art deco styling (yay, marble entryway!), and the comfy "living room" area behind the check-in desk are good for both people-watching and putting your feet up next to the fireplace.  Not gaudy, just inviting and good. I was super-happy at this place.  Granted, if I was traveling with family, there's no way it would have worked.  But as a busy business traveler who likes comfy things, this place rocks.  I won't stay anywhere else. Again, think solo business travel.  Do not bring your kids or harem here.
