5 stars for Tammie!!! Of all the architectural boat tours, hop-on-hop-off tours, lake cruises, walking tours and now Segway tours we have taken, I can say that this is the most fun way to tour parts of downtown Chicago. We were looking for a tour that our teenage son would enjoy and that would show us parts of the city that we had never seen and this tour was the perfect choice. Â All depends on your guide though. Tammie rocked it - didn't waste any time, took us to cool places off the beaten path and she was full of information about the city and the sites we were seeing. That said, we took this tour another time with some friends and were so disappointed to have a guide who basically just phoned it in - almost no narration, long breaks and constantly watching his watch. Bottom line, great tour but insist on having a guide who will give you your money's worth.
