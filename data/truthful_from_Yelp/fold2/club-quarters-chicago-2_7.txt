We liked it here.   We found a good deal on Hotels.com, and took advantage.   The room was a little small, the view non-existent, but for the price, it was great.   Convenient to just about anything.   Walked to Millineum Park, the Art Institute, Willis Tower, and more.   Short train ride to other attractions.    Only complaint is that the parking garage is further away than they gave it credit for.    The girls at the front desk were amazingly helpful, though.
