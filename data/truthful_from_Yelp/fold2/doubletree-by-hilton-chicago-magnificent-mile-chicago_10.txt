This place is the bomb. My first hotel experience in Chicago. Pablo's professionalism when we checked in was outstanding. They give you a cookie warmed when you check in! My wife and I were part of a conference so our wifi was free. Best customer service I have ever had. Maybe it's just Chicago, but everywhere here has awesome customer service!
