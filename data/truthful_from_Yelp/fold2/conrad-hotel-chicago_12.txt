We stayed here for one night and had an overall wonderful experience.  They kindly accommodated our early check-in request which we were really hoping for.  Our room was on the top floor and was very clean, quiet, and comfortable - just as described online.  Parking was very easy directly across the street in the garage and was much less than doing the valet.  The staff was very friendly and we truly felt like VIPs throughout the entire stay.  Hotel Conrad is in a great location with dozens of high quality restaurants within walking distance.  We are definitely going to be staying here again!  Thank you Hotel Conrad for an amazing evening!
