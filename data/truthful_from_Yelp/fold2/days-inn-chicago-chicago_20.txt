Whether you're in Chi Town for a Cubs game or visiting the Family & Friends or just to explore... you cannot and will not beat the location! If you live in the burbs and want a quickie getaway in the city w/or w/out the kids...it doesn't have to get fancy! This is your place! You can walk to the park, check out the boats at Belmont Harbor, walk to the zoo! Â There are some fabulous restaurants in the hood that only a local would know! Easy to get anywhere from there!!! The Days Inn Chicago is a sparkle of a gem, friendly, helpful staff and here's the best kept secret... You never know which band you'll run into (secretly shhh!) staying there!
