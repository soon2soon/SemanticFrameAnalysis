We had an amazing trip with Chitown Party Bus! Chris was very helpful and cooperative in booking the bus. Our driver, Wilson was punctual and incredibly patient, especially on the way back when everyone was far from sober! Â  We were told the bus capacity was 29, but 23-25 would have been a little more comfortable. It was a little crowded, but overall a really great experience.
