Definitely worth a cruise to browse about the architectural site in Chicago! Our host for the event was very informative on the history and how each significant building came about! Random fact is that the oldest buidling was built in 1898. Â (Don't quote me on that, however!) Overall, a pleasant cruise to be on and to enjoy the view of Chicago on a boat!
