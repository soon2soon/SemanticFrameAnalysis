This is arguably the best and most consistent form of transportation in Chicago. Â And if you buy the 10-ride pass on a weekday, it comes out to 1.75 a ride, which is definitely the cheapest commute in Chicago. Hell, even if you don't, the prices aren't bad. I work in Ping Tom Park--one of the most underutilized and BEAUTIFUL parks in the city, if I do say so myself--and this is the most direct route there, especially if I need to go to our downtown location. They're always on schedule (about every 20-30 minutes) and even in the rain (or full blown storm, as was the case last week), it's a smooth ride. Also, the crew has been wonderful every time I've taken a trip. Also, it's great if you don't have any plans, want to change things up, or if you have kids (they LOVE it and the crew is great about answering questions).
