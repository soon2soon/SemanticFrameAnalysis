I must say that the staff and management at this hotel goes above and beyond to make your stay wonderful.  They are so nice !! The location is close to everything so we were able to walk almost anywhere. They serve breakfast every morning and make the best coffee. There was noise from outside and I did have trouble sleeping But Josh the manager really did all he could to help...out of their control It is downtown...very busy place. Even though I complained it meant so much to get great customer service And that's why I give this place 5 stars.   Great front desk, all the staff was friendly.....
