Today I did the Loop tour with Claire. She was really great providing interesting facts about Chicago history and its architecture. She is really passionate about the city and makes the time fly when talking about Chicago and its building. I really enjoyed the tour, have fun and learned a lot about Chicago and its building. If you have time and want to learn about the city, this is made for you!
