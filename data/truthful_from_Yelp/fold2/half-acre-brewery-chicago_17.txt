My husband and I had the best time attending the brewery tour this past Saturday for his birthday.  ATTENTION:  If you want to do the tour, you must get in line early!  We got in line at 10:03 for the 11:00 tour, and we ended up being #62 and #63 in line (they give out 65 tickets).  There was definitely some line-saving going on ahead of us where people got there early to save spots for their friends (which I find a bit sketchy, but there isn't any way to enforce it; so plan for that).  They handed out tickets to the first 65 people in like at around 10:30.  There were probably at least 50 people in line behind us that waited almost as long as we did but missed out, and another couple dozen that came after they handed out the tickets.  So set your alarm, get up early, grab some breakfast and a coffee on the way, and get in line.  You won't be sorry. The tour costs $10 (cash only) and includes a souvenir glass and 3 FULL glasses of beer (choose 3 of the 4 types they have on tap that day).  One of the beers we got to try had just been released the day before- pretty cool stuff. Our guide, Tom, could moonlight as a stand-up comedian.  He was seriously hilarious and had us smiling/laughing the whole tour.  We learned a lot about brewing beer but also about the history of the company.  He and all the people we encountered throughout the day were very cool and genuinely seemed to love what they do. Such a great day and so worth the wait in line.  This is now going to be one of our go-to activities when friends/family come in town.
