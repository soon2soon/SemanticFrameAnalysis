We booked our room with a Groupon for a little birthday weekend staycation. We were so impressed with everything from the service, linens, design, and especially the amenities. They have a fully stocked wine rack in the room and the prices are super fair! For example, a bottle of Alamos Malbec was only $16! You can't beat their mini bar prices! Can't wait to come back. Also, I NEED to have those pillows and comforter in my own home. Dear God was that heaven?
