I arranged for a group rate for my out-of-town wedding guests a few months before our wedding. From day one, Mike in sales was super responsive (returned emails mostly within minutes to hours) and went out of his way to accommodate any requests that we had. The rate that we got was very reasonable for August in Chicago. Many of our guests told us how much they liked the hotel (location, amenities). The decor is very modern and cheery. There is also free continental breakfast and wireless internet, which is a plus. I would recommend the Fairfield for group reservations since we had a great experience with this.
