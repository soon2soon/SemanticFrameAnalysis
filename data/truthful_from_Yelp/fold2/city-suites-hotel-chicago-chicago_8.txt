I really enjoyed my stay at the City Suites, the location was perfect, right near the L, with a ton of local shops and bars all over the block.  The room was clean and beautiful, classic and simple, the bed was very comfortable, the tv was big and perfectly placed in the bedroom to lie in bed and watch a movie, the staff was helpful and attentive, and the breakfast was served in the cozy little lobby lounge near a fireplace with comfy chairs to relax in.  The only downside was the cost of parking ($22 per day) a block away, but for the cost, quality, and location, I can't complain.
