I'm a bit late in writing this review, as I last used the service in February 2014. For our trip to O'Hare, the driver arrived right on time.  The requested car seat was already installed, which was great considering my 1 year old was rather annoyed that he was yanked out of his warm, comfortable crib at 4:30 AM to go to the airport in Chiberia weather. Our scheduled return coincided with yet another winter storm warning for Chicago.  Our flight from OGG to LAX wasn't in any danger of being canceled, but our connecting flight back from LAX to ORD definitely was.  Not wanting to be stranded there with the 1 year old and quick-to-complain 8 year old, I changed our flight to two days later.  I was impressed that someone at Going Green Limousine answered the phone and sounded awake and alert at 3 AM Chicago time. The schedule change went through with no problems. Each driver was courteous and drove very well.   While the price is a bit high for me to afford on a regular basis, it seems like you get what you pay for with car service, so I'm willing to pay more to this company.
