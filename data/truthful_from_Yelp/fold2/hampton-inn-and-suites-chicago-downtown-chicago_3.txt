I saw the pictures online and I knew it was going to be a nice size room but it was bigger than I expected. I was only here for one night and I wish I'd have stayed longer. As far as the noise goes, it wasn't as bad as a lot of people wrote. I feel it added to the experience instead of taking away. The staff was very friendly and catered to all of my needs. I will definitely be coming again. Great hotel!
