This hotel is located in the Theater district of Chicago right above the Bank of America Theater which was showing Book of Mormon at the time I stayed.  The hotel is extremely clean with amazingly high ceilings and pictures windows opening up to the Chicago city skyline.  There is a breakfast that rotates (to save you from food boredom) each morning and they even put out hot and fresh cookies around 5. The staff was very friendly during check in, check out, and even helped with my laundry and dining recommendations. I would definitely recommend this location because of its proximity to so much and hospitable team.
