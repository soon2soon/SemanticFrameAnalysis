The Enterprise at 5844 N. Western was the second one I'd called -- looking for a special weekend rate.  The first Enterprise (a little farther south on Western) did not have any special rates and was too busy to help me.  When I spoke with the guys at 5844 they confirmed they also did not have a special rate, but they would give me a SWEET deal on an SUV rental.  Better to give me a lower rate on the SUV than to have it just sitting in their parking lot all weekend.  Smart people -- they have my rental biz sewn up!
