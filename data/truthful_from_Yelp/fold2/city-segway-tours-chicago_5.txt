I've done a Segway tour of San Francisco before and when we saw the opportunity to do a tour of Chicago (and save my aching feet), we jumped on the chance. Our tour group was small (the 3 of us plus 2 other people) and fortunately there were no mishaps. It was my 15 year old's first time on one and he picked it up super quick. Our tour guide was awesome and funny and the whole tour was just great!
