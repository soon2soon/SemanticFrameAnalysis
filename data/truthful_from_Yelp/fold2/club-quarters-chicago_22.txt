Simply the best business-class hotel I've ever stayed in. With rooms designed for the business traveler -- rather than a leisure hotel room retrofitted for business uses -- guests enjoy free wifi, productive workspaces in the room, generous and well-placed electrical outlets, and free bottled (well you have to bottle it) water and coffee. Guests also have free access to Net workstations. Â Kiosk check-in also available in the lobby.
