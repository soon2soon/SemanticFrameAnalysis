I feel I must give a hearty shout out to Gabriel Magliaro of Half Acre Brewery. My organization was hosting a not-for-profit event, and we reached out to Half Acre to see if they could help us out by supplying some of their product. Gabriel generously donated a good quantity of their delicious Daisy Cutter pale ale and their Pony Pilsner. All of the attendees loved the craft brews and were constantly surrounding the pouring table to get additional samples. Many thanks to the good people at Half Acre for their generosity and quality product.
