Love it! Great way to get around to bars/restaurants.  Not to mention, you get a little tour of the city on the way. I actually got to go on it for free because of the friends of the river pub crawl. If you are on a time schedule, this probably isnt the best.  Who knows when they are coming/going. Get on and enjoy the views!   A cheap boat ride for sure.  Perfect for a random night in the city or taking someone around to sightsee.
