I can only say good things about Fullerton, since that is where I met my husband of 7 years. I was walking from a friend's house at 1am, and when I got up to the platform, I saw him sitting on a bench. I thought he was cute, so I walked into the same train car as he did. It was filled with loud obnoxious peopel on one end, and he was standing by the door. I kept looking at him through the window, and it turns out that he was doing the same through another reflection. When it was almost my stop, I came up to the door and stood next to him. He commented me on my spider necklace that I had, and I was like "oh, thanks". Finally, it was my stop: Howard, teh end stop. I started walking towards the parking lot, and he was following me. I pretended to tie my shoelace, and noticed that he slowed down. He caught up with me on the way to the stairwell into the parking lot, and asked me where I was going. We started a small talk, and wound up talking next to my car for a lil bit. I gave him my #, and he called back after he returned from Cali, where he is from. We met, and pretty much spent all the time together. He was going to go back to Ca, but decided to stay in Chicago, since thats where I was. That was 7 years ago. :) We are planning to reanact this before we move to California this year.
