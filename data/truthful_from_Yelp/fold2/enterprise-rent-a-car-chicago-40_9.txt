Since my last review I have rented here about five more times. I've always been impressed with the service. The people here work  hard and take care of their customers.  They are a class act. The only one negative review I see on here, it seems that she had some personal issues. This place is a great city location close to where I live, easy to pick up and easy to return 24 hours.
