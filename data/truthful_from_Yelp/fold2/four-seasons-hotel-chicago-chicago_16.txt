We held our wedding ceremony in the Lakeview Room of the Four Seasons and had the pleasure of planning the details with Alison and Melissa.  The room itself is gorgeous - lake views, warm tones and elegant for a wedding.  Alison and Melissa were fantastic in the planning process.  We used a deluxe one bedroom suite for getting ready and it is spacious with two bathrooms and light from every corner. They had sweet bridal amenities such as bobby pins, mini deodorant, etc. - everything the bridal party might need.  Staff is friendly and helpful, food is delicious.  The kid's playroom is a true gem too!
