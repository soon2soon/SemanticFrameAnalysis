Whether you're a tourist in Chicago or just playing Tourist for a Day, the luxurious Elysian is where you want to stay. The suites are amazing and rooms have their own doorbell, although I'm not sure who would be ringin' your bell while you're here (only you should know that!). Super cool modern art adorns the rooms and the huge bathrooms Â are beautiful with marble touches, and are probably larger than most studio apartments in Chicago. Close to the shops on Michigan Ave., but tucked away from the madness, this is a great location for a winter or summer getaway. Blissfully, delightful, appropriately named, the Elysian.
