Great tour!  The staff was energetic, the views were spectacular! My companion and I bought tickets online, and picked them up at will-call with no problems!  We got in line for the boat, and minutes later, boarded.  The standing in line was not bad at all, as the tour guide took the time to socialize with the people in line and get a feel of her audience! (+1!!!) We decided to sit on the lower level (outdoors), but closer to the bathrooms...and bar, heh. Despite the beauty of the buildings, the smoothness of the boatride, what I feel compelled to compliment is...the cleanliness of the bathrooms.  There is nthing worse than getting confined to a space with dirty bathrooms... The bar was a little pricey, but not terribly so!
