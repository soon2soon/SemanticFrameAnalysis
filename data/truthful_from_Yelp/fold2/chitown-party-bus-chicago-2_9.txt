Had an amazing time on the Black Cool party bus for Superbowl weekend! Everyone was extremely professional and friendly. Our driver Jake was awesome all night with all of our stops. We had more fun on the bus than any of the clubs we went to. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a party bus for a good price!
