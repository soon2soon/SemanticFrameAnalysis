Been wanting to go here for ages and finally had the chance to go yesterday for a mid day pick me up. Was packed at 330 and finally settled down when I was ready to leave around 7 (on a saturday) A little tight with the communal seating but people are so friendly to let you sit next to them, it's not a big deal!! You are able to bring food in, they don't serve food. Plenty of nearly spots and they even have a menu of local spots available. It's so fun and workers are so friendly.
