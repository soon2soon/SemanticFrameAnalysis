We stayed here for two days during a recent trip to Chicago. Ever the paranoid person, I spent some time perusing tripadvisor.com ratings and trying to find the best hotel in the best location in this general price range. This one had the best ratings for its price point, and lived up to its reviews. The hotel was clean and updated (fairly modern but cozy), all of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, check-in and check-out was a breeze (no wait, no confusion), and the hotel was within walking distance of tons of stuff: shopping on Michigan Ave., Millenium Park, Navy Pier, the river walk, etc. It was very cold out on the day of check-out, and our transportation was not arriving until 12:30 p.m., but the front desk staff were pleasant and happily accommodated my request for a late check-out. We were very pleased with our stay here, and will definitely stay at this hotel again if we are in the area.
