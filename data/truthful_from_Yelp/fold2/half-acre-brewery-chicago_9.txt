We went in to explore, and I love that they let you sample what they have on tap! The staff was very friendly and it was interesting to hear about the history of Half Acre. You can get their beers by the 64 or 32 oz growler. We got a 32oz growler of their Peace IPA. They also have glasses, t-shirts, canned beer, cases, and various artwork for sale.
