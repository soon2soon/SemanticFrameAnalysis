Since it took me like 3 months to write this review, this is more of an overview. Was recommended the Elysian Hotel during a recent business trip to Chicago. I had a meeting with the salesperson and was given a tour, so that was nice to see the ins and outs of the entire place. Rather than changing hotels, I decided to stay there for the duration of my visit, about 3 nights. Even though I was there on a site visit, I only had one meeting with the salesperson and the rest of the time, I was just a regular guest. The rooms are big, I believe I was in a suite, and there were two 42-inch plasmas, a fireplace, a large bathroom and plenty of work space. They strategically placed the desk in front of the window, which is better than staring at a wall while you're working. The colors and decor were simple and contemporary, the bed was super comfy, the tv actually worked the way it was supposed to, and room service was very accommodating and actually arrived before the promised time. A rarity in hotels. Service all around the hotel from valet to front desk were really attentive and friendly, but in a non-pompous way. I called down to ask when and what channel American Idol was showing and the guy actually looked into it and called me back. Stupid Central Time. Missed it. Oh well. The huge drive that they have in front of the hotel is heated, so that snow doesn't collect. It's great because you don't have to worry about mushy, dirty slush when you step out of your car. Best part of all, they don't accept gratuity. Makes everything so much easier not having to tip. It's like being back in Japan. Just this policy alone will probably have me coming back.
