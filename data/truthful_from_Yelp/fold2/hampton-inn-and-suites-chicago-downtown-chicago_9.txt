LOVE this hotel. Like another poster, I have stayed at pretty much all the Hilton/Marriott properties in the loop and River North. Â This is the best by far, and I am kicking myself for not staying here before. Free easily accessible wifi--no stupid codes that change daily. Good breakfast, and not as manic as some places. Unbelievably nice staff, from front door to desk to breakfast to engineering. Great king bed suite--if you get one that doesn't face Dearborn, it is a lot quieter. Great pool and spa. Staying here from now on when in Chicago.
