I stayed here for just a few nights while visiting the city- I got a great deal on hotels.com and I was very pleased with my stay! From the doorman to the front desk and the housekeeping as well- everyone had top notch customer service at ALL times- staff was extremely on point and treated my man & I with the up most respect. I will be staying here on all returned visits to Chicago. The amenities here are great as well- I loved the pool/spa and outdoor courtyard to just hang out and lounge! The king size room we had was also a very relaxing place to recuperate for our busy schedule- we slept like babies! This hotel has a pretty great location as it's close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping !
