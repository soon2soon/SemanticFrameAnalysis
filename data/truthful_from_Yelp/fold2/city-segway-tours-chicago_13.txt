A Chicago lifer and have never been on a segway tour.  We were looking for something unique as a Chicago themed outing for our out-of-town guests, and we finally settled on a segway tour.  Reviews of City Segway Tours swayed our decision to use them for our afternoon entertainment. We did a 3 hour tour with Brennan as our guide and OMG, he did not disappoint!!  I was a little apprehensive as I have never been on a segway prior to last Saturday, however the company could not have emphasized the safety issues any more than they did.  From the short video upon arrival to the patient guide making sure we were all comfortable with the segway, I was reassured it would be a fun and safe experience. If you choose City Segway Tours you will be glad you did.  We will be back, for sure!
