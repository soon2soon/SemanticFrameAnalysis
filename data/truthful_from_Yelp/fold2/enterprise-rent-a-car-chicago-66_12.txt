We were treated very well during my recent visit here to rent a car for a trip to the burbs. The car was ready when promised and there was no insurance pressure. I had reserved ahead of time on the Internet - that may have helped. Staff was friendly and the car was clean. No problems on the return either. Easily walkable from Michigan Ave hotels or accessible via the Red Line Subway/Chicago & State.
