This was a great tour. I think everyone needs to go on this tour at some point in their life. The buildings in Chicago have so much history and stories behind them, plus they are beautiful. We had a great quarky little lady who loved her job. She kept everyone laughing while providing great information about the buildings. I would do this again in a heartbeat. By the way, they serve booze on the ship...can't get much better!
