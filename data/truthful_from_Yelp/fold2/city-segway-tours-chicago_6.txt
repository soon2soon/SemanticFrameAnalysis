Clark is the best tour guide ever! This was a great tour and we really enjoyed it.   Got to see a lot of the Grant Park/Museum Campus area.  It's so much easier than walking around and you can see the places you want to go back and visit. Yes, you look like a dorky tourist but it is fun.   Our "training" session took a little longer because we had an older woman who tried valiantly, but failed to get the hang of it so she had to bow out of the tour.  But once we got started, it was great. Definitely recommend it!
