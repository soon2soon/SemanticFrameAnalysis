I recently had the pleasure of staying here on a weekend trip to Chicago. I loved it honestly. The price was cheaper or at what all the competitors in the area where at. The Valet was crazy affordable and you could have your car back and back into valet as many times as you wanted for a flat fee. The lobby was great i love the Egyptian accents it really classed up the joint. Front staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Its right next door to my favorite restaurant Kumas Too. Location couldnt be more accommodating and amazing. But back to the hotel i digress, the room was small but to me thats not a bad things it was efficient. it was clean. the bed was amazing comfy ( i wanted to steal the pillows seriously almost would have been worth them charging the credit card ), the bathroom was well lite and clean. The in hotel room free shampoo and stuff smelled really great! rooms feature an in room safe, tv, mutiple usb ports, a coffee maker, big bed, ironing board etc etc. No pool here though! bumz! the continental breakfast was pretty good actually i ate a lot a lot, fresh fruits, oatmeal, bagels, muffins etc etc common variety. Either way im pretty set this will be my go to hotel whenever im back in town.
