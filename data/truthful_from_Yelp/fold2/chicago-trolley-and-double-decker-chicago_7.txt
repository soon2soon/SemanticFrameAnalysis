Best part of our Chicago trip. Allowed us to get around, see the sites and never have to get our car out of the parking garage. We got the three day pass. There were several stops around the city one right by our hotel. You can get on and off at any stop for most of the day. Buses run about every ten minutes. The night tour runs 6pm to 10pm. It has only 4 stops and doesn't go out as far. One of the stops is navy pier which is fun at night. During the tours you get lots of information from the guides. Some guides are better than others. Some are funny, some are factual, some are annoying if you don't like the guide then hop off and catch the next bus. We had beautiful weather for the tours. I don't think it would be very fun in the rain. You can sit in the bottom though and still hear the tour and enjoy the ride. Don't take what the guides say as fact. After riding several different buses and several different guides we kept hearing contrasting stories and facts about the sites. But we all really enjoyed it. A must for families with kids too. My 2 year old loved it!
