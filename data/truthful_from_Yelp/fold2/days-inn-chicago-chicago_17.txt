Location! Location! Location! I was recently put up here for a few nights during a conference at the zoo. It was close enough to walk to just about everything, including at least 5 Starbucks in a 6 block radius and oddly enough 2 Urban Outfitters. The room was big enough for myself and someone else without being on top of each other. Best of all though, parking wasn't an arm and a leg! It's next door to a mall so you can park there for less and use the gym in there too. I was impressed. The breakfast is pretty standard: bagels, muffins, juice and coffee. But it's free so there isn't much to complain about. All of the staff I interacted with were very nice and helpful (although I have to note that one of the valet guys almost hit my car and I'm pretty sure he doesn't have an American license). I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
