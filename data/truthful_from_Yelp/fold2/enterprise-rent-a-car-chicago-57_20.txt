I rent exclusively from Enterprise for business and pleasure for one key reason: personable, attentive, and welcoming customer service.  While on vacation here in Chicago we needed a suburban for our family and luggage.  There wasn't one on site when we got there.  Our alternative was to rent two vehicles - but that wasn't an option for the staff at the counter.  Allison and her manager called around to other locations and within 20 mins we had our car.  All 8 of us and our luggage fit perfectly and we were on our way.  It is important for business to turn potentially sour situations into opportunities to delight the customer. They have this lesson down at Enterprise - especially at this location.  Allison, you are an angel.
