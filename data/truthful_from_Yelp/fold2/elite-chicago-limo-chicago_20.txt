I used this company for a birthday party over the weekend and couldn't be more please!! Loved them, arrived on time, driver actually had a personality and wasn't grouchy and the company was very helpful with setting me up a limo for my birthday. Oh and the complimentary condiments definitely helped on the ride home, hah. This was back in July!
