I first went on a wildlife safari GA organized through the Serengeti. That was a trip of a lifetime that went off without a hitch. They did such an incredible job I later took my wife on a GA trip to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. Again they organized a logistically flawless trip that we still rave about to our friends. On both trips their local staff were attentive and knowledgable and service oriented. If you are looking for an operator who will go the extra mile to ensure you have a trip to remember, then look no further than Global Adrenaline.
