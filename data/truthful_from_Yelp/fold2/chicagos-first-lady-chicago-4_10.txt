What an awesome boat cruise! We took the architectural cruise on the river through the city! The docent was incredible sharing her knowledge of all the fabulous and diverse buildings along with city history! I thought sitting on the top that it would be too warm (in August) but it was really nice with the shady spots you get going under all the bridges and at times shadows casted from the buildings. It truly was a beautiful way to see the city, a different perspective you'll never get from the streets! We highly recommend this for all ages! This has to be hands down one of the best tours we've been on ever!
