Can I say I had an awesome time here??? Yes I did.  Even though the hotel was not as swank as other Marriott's this hotel was nice.  The hotel was close to everything in the city and we were able to maneuver around wonderfully,  The rooms were clean, the towels were fresh and the beds were comfy.  The staff was very nice and friendly..I felt very welcomed.  This was my first time in Chicago and I must say I had an awesome time!!! Keep it up Marriott!!!
