Great views and nice customers.  No spitting on the train like on the Red Line.  I enjoy riding it all the way out to Kimball.  I did have to wait an hour once transferring at Belmont with no explanations.  However coming from New York, I'm used to random subway delays.  CTA transit staff is generally very kind and helpful.  They offer help without you even asking.  They don't avoid eye contact and then run away when you approach like in NYC.
