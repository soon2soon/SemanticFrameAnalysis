I have stayed at the CQ on Wacker a few times and this was my first stay at the Loop location.  Both are equally fine and an extraordinary bargain. The rooms are cheap--not in the bad sense but in the good sense.  Rooms are smallish, but I wasn't there too long at a time, so who cares.  And the hotel is very quiet, even though it's on a very busy downtown street.  The staff is helpful and friendly.  Two added bonuses.  This location is only three blocks from Russian Tea Time, one of the must-go restaurants in Chicago.  And the lobby restaurant/bar, Elephant and Castle, is quite fine with that low-key charm that only lobby bars can have.  Since I was trying to get tipsy enough to forget about a bad week at work, I downed three well-made vodka tonics, and I even got advice on the fine art of getting tipsy from the friendly bartender.  She even made the third one a little stronger--that did the trick.
