This was a fantastically fun tour...and I'm not even big on ghosts and such.  We had such a great time, hearing the history of Chicago's criminals, prison breaks, ghost stories, etc., thoroughly enjoyed the walk and sights and sounds as we made our way, and Seth was an amazing tour guide!  He got to know each of us a little bit, and played off our interests and such a bit as he took on the tour.  Thanks for a great time, Seth! 1.5 hours for the ghost tour (starting at the Congress Plaza Hotel on Michigan Avenue), no cost (but give tips, if you can!), and a great way to meet other tourists or even locals (like myself) as you go out and about seeing things you might never be aware of otherwise visiting this great city.
