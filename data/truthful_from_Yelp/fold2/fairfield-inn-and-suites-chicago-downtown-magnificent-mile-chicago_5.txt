I had a very positive experience here. They offer a very competitive price for the location which is right in the heart of downtown Chicago. They have a guard and you need a keycard to access the elevators at night. They stored my luggage during my interview and quickly retrieved it when I came back to pick it up. They offer the standard complimentary toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, razor). They offer complimentary breakfast. Parking and valet service are very expensive, which is the same as the rest of downtown Chicago. All in all, they offered everything I was looking for on a business trip for a very affordable price given their location.
