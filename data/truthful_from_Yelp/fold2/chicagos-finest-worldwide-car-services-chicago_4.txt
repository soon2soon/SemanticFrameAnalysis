I had a great experience with this company! I was in Chicago for a month for work and needed a car service to take me to and from the location each day. Initially I started with another car service, but quickly learned that I was being ripped off because they were sending me uber x drivers (people driving their personal cars) and not professional car services. I found David and his company through using Uber and they were fantastic. All the drivers were personable and professional. Cars were clean every day (despite the horrible winter weather in Chicago) and they didn't have those awful air fresheners that make me nauseous. My cars were always early and waiting for me (not the case with the previous company) and they didn't give me a hard time if I was running a little late. I worked with David (the owner), Jim, Andre, and Marco and all were great! One day I mentioned that I wanted to try this donut place near my hotel and the next morning there was a donut waiting for me on the seat! Now that's what I call service! They also have an iPhone app that you can use to book trips, which I found really convenient. You can find it by searching the name of the company in the App Store. I see some reviewers had bad experiences with a groupon deal. I've heard of a lot if cases where small businesses get easily overwhelmed by groupons. Not saying it's an excuse, just isn't reflective of the level of service I know this company can provide. I will definitely be using them again when I am back in Chicago!
