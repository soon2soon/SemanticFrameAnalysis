Amazing hotel in Chicago. Came here for a business trip and was quite impressed with the Allium Restaurant as well as the rooms. I had a beautiful view from my room with great big screen TV and very clean accommodations. Concierge was very helpful and even mentioned there was a complimentary porshe test drive event during the coming days. Restaurant was open late and had an interesting bread appetizer that we ordered as a group. They had a nice selection of scotch, whiskey, wines, and beers.
