The brewery tour was really great. They went into a lot more detail and the history of the brewery than most other tours I've been on. Plus, it's a great deal $10 for the tour, a pint glass, and three pints of beer. Not bad, eh. The one thing to know is that you have to get there early. It's at 11 on Saturday, and only 60 people get in. I arrived at 9:30 and was number 7 in line; I think the line reached the 60-person cutoff shortly after 10. Also: $10, cash only. Make sure you hit the ATM ahead of time. After the tour, you can have a couple more in the taproom, and grab a t-shirt and growler in the store.
