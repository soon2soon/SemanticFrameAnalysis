We stay at this hotel every time we come to Chicago. The staff is beyond friendly and helpful and they have gone out of their way to make our experience amazing! Because we were frequent guests they have always provided us with the cheapest rates possible. We love the staff here so much we've even bought them a pizza as a thank you! My friends and I frequent Chicago for concerts and we always stay here...the staff is so cute they always ask us how the show was and we share pictures. The hotel is always clean and has many desirable amenities, including free and fast wifi!! Close to many desirable Chicago attractions...we rarely had to take any type of cab. Found a ton of hidden Chicago treasures as well!
