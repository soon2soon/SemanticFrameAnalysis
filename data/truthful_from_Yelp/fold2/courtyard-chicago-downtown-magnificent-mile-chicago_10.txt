For being one of the hotels pretty much in mag mile I thought this hotel was great!! It was located next to almost every store, restaurant, and karaoke bar that I wanted to see!  Check in and out was fast, the rooms were huge for being downtown Chicago!  There is a Dublin donuts across the street and 7 eleven for those that want breakfast or forgot some things on your trip.  It is about a 16 min walk from the millineum park and "the bean".  Big lobby area to sit in our eat at.  Very clean also!
