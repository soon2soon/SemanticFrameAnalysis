Had one of the best parties of my life on "Big Daddy"!  One of my friend's bachelor party.  Price was right, sound and lighting system were AWESOME, tons of cooler space, in house beer bong was used copiously, and the stripper poles came in very handy for our, um, strippers!  (Aaand a couple of my d-bag friends, but I digress...) Our driver Chris, (I think he's also the owner) was awesome and very accommodating to our drunken asses!   Would totally do this again for other buddies bachelor parties in the future.  Thanks for the great time Chris!
