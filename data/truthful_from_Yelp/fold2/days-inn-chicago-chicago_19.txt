Clean,comfy & extremely helpful staff. They checked us in early and held our bags the next day. This is a super cool neighborhood and the price for the hotel was so much more than reasonable. Again, it's a Days Inn people.  If you have Four Seasons tastes/expectations you will be dissatisfied. But if you want a small comfortable room at a great price you will have no problems. Also the continental breakfast was amazing except for the other guests filling up water bottles with juice and stuffing doughnuts in their purses. C'mon people!  I guess that's why I'm not morbidly obese .
