When I travel, one of my favorite things to do is visit local breweries, especially craft. I feel it gives me a great sense of a city or town's culture, and, well...beer! I'm a Denver native (so I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to beer) and was visiting my older brother in Chi-town for a couple of days. He told me about this place and said he'd been meaning to go, so we called and hopped on a tour spot. The tap room itself is great-small, comfortable, but still a good amount of room. They sell awesome t-shirts (I got a great ringer T) alongside their beers, and naturally some other gear. The tour itself was really fun, and a very unique spin on the brewery tour. It costs you about $5-but you get a pint glass to keep with a sweet logo, and you get to fill that pint glass full 3 times during the tour. A glass and 3 beers for $5?! Total steal! So here's how the tour works-start off by having your glass filled with a first beer, and go meet your guide for the first step. They'll go throw the history of the brewery, and the first steps in the brewing process. After that, take 5 to get your next beer. Rinse a repeat for a total of 3 beers and 3 steps. The brewers at Half Acre are very friendly, knowledgable folks, and they believe in quality over quantity-when I was there, there were only 3-4 beers being made-amongst them, the Daisy Cutter, an amazing pale ale. Half Acre is a great brewery all around-great beer, great folks, great vibe. If you're in Chicago, I consider it a must stop!
