I LOVE this hotel!! Great location, great dining and shopping is steps away. The staff is super friendly and accommodating, the lobby and rooms are spotless, not to mention the BEDS are heavenly!! Â I live in the north suburbs of Chicago and whenever I want a mini vacation, I head here. I like to call it my home away from home!! I highly recommend it, I'd like to live there!!!!
