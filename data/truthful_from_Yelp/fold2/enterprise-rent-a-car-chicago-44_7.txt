I rented a min van on last Friday (4/26). The rental was little bit expensive as I booked the vehicle just after I landed in midway. I just paid with credit card at the downstairs office and to my surprise there was no paper work at the front desk. I went to fourth floor to pick the vehicle. This time I was more surprised to see that the staff was using personal tablets to rent a vehicle. Everything from marking the damages and dents to rental agreement signature they were using the digital format. Finally at the exit they gave the receipt and that's only the receipt I did carry. The staff was friendly and i asked the directions to a address and one of the staff listed out to me very patiently.
