An overdue review from early February From the moment you pull into the European inspired courtyard the level of service is unsurpassed. Doors open, bags are whisked away, check in quick and flawless and every tip offered is refused, The rooms are large, well layed out with beautiful marble bathrooms. The location is centrally located near Rush street and a short walk to Michigan Ave. We did not dine or use the spa. Nothing on our 3 night stay to fault.
