This review is for their Allium Restaurant located on the 7th floor. I stopped by here on a Saturday night for a fancy dinner. Driving was so hectic! People everywhere and trying to maneuver in tiny Chicago streets. Anyway, got there, valeted my car and the moment i stepped into the hotel, someone was there to greet and guide me to where i needed to be. It was a nice welcome. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL! Trust me, you can never be "over dressed" here. So put on your best outfit and have a romantic dinner or what not here! =) I love dinning at places like this because the moment you step into the restaurant, you don't have annoying kids running around or screaming, obnoxious adults conversating loudly as if they are begging people to hear about what they're talking about. Instead, its got this smooth jazzy like atmosphere, with light chit chat and the sound of forks and knifes working away at a great meal. I didn't care much for starts or apps so we got Wagyu Skirt Steak, Wild Striped Bass, House Cut Fries, and macaroons for dessert! I would recommend getting their Filet or Ribeye because the couple next to us said it was delicious! But since i dont like red meat as much, i opted for fish. The presentation from both of our dishes was elegant. The smell of the fresh Bass, seasoned to perfection was worth every penny! The fish was cooked perfectly. Very tender and the pieces fall off easily. I admit, it was small =( but tasty! The macaroons was just macaroons. You can get them elsewhere at popular macaroon places in downtown. They all kind of taste the same. I had a wonderful experience here. The staff was polite, attentive and friendly. Service was great and food was awesome. * i wish i had taken food pictures to show you guys. But i was too occupied with my food and totally forgot lol.
