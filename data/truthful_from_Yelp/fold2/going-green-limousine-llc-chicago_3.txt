We were looking for a way to get eight 11-year-olds and four adults to LEGOLand in Schaumburg for a birthday party which is about an hour away.  We decided to try to arrange a limousine to make the trip special.  One quick phone call and we booked Going Green's stretch Lincoln Navigator. Jessie, the driver, arrived on time and helped all of us get loaded.  After a quick tour of the Navigator showing us how to work the air and the music, we were on our way. The Navigator was clean and in perfect shape. All 12 of us fit perfectly. The girls loved the starry sky in the ceiling! We arrived exactly on time at LEGOLand. As a bonus, there were also 12 seatbelts! When it was time to leave, Jessie was ready for us at the front door.  He was polite and courteous with a lovely sense of humor.  He even took our photo for us in front of the limo with all of our party hats and balloons.  He also helped load some of our extra food from the party into the back trunk. Our ride home was just as smooth and fun as the ride out.  At one point the girls erupted into singing a Katy Perry song, and Jessie told them over the intercom that he would take them over the radio any day. They were thrilled. Our experience with Going Green Limousine couldn't have been any better.  Thank you for making my daughter's birthday perfect. We look forward to using them again for future birthdays!
