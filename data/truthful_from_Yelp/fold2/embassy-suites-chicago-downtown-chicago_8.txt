In addition to being a great value due to Embassy Suites' standard two room accommodations, complimentary breakfast and happy hour, this hotel offers a great location.  This property succeeds on every level.  Breakfast was delicious with plenty of options (including soup and salad for those that don't prefer traditional breakfast foods).  Happy hour drinks and snacks were served with a smile.  The front desk staff was warm and helpful.  Our suite was clean and comfortable (microwave/refrigerator included).  The workout room was well equipped and the lap pool looked refreshing.  Valet parking was $59.00 per day, but there was a self-park garage next door for $43.00 per day (less on weekends).   A Jewel Osco grocery store is located across the street, Starbucks next door and restaurants on every corner (I recommend Quartino for wine and Italian fare).  It is a short walk to Michigan Avenue where you can shop all day.  If you are looking for a great way to explore the city, I suggest Taste Bud Tours (tastebudtours.com).
