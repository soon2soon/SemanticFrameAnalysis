I was very suprised with the Fairfield Inn! I loved the beds (they have those wonderful Marriott thick beds)! And the location. You can't beat the location. It's a block away from Mag Mile, close to public transportation, shops, movie theatres and great dining. The staff was incredibly helpful. I recommend this Fairfield Inn to everyone who is visiting Chicago.
