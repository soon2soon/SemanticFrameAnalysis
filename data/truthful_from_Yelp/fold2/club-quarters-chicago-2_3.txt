Picked this hotel for a recent stay mainly because of it's location, reviews, and price.  It is indeed in a great location!  The rooms are small but, modern in design.  Internet is provided complimentary.  They have a water station right off of the elevator where you can fill water bottles with chilled water.   Parking is $24/day in a lot within a 5 minute walk of the hotel or $45/day via the valet.  If you choose the self park, you are not allowed to leave and come back or you'll get charged $24 with in 20 minutes of parking it . The hotel is indeed in a great location and is walkable to a great many tourist attractions, restaurants and shopping.   There is one restaurant, an English style pub, and no pool.  :(  The views outside the window are to another building.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating!  Great recommendations from them on things to do, directions, restaurants etc. Getting to the hotel from the highway and leave is a piece of cake!  I'd highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I was in town visiting.
