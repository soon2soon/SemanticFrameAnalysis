This hotel is great in every way. Great location on Michigan Avenue; not technically Michigan Avenue but it might as well be considered Michigan Avenue since the entrance is through the mall or around the corner. The rooms are great with a large bathroom. Breakfast is great too. Service is ultra friendly. In particular I would like to point out Abel in the bar. Â He provided us exceptional service. Thanks Conrad Hotel. I highly recommend and will be back.
