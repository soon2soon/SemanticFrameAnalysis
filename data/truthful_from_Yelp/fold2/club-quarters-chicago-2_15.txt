Dear Club Quarters (Central Loop), I had an AMAZING weekend with you. Let's do it again soon?! Thank you for being spacious and adorable, with a flat screen TV, and a kind of cool view of the street and a huge garbage dumpster. Being that I'm from California, all that mattered to me was that I could see the snow on the ground:) I loved the restaurant attached to the side, Elephant and Castle, I think it was called. Your brownie parfait alone made me gain four pounds, I'm quite sure, but was Oh So Delicious, and Oh So Worth It. Thank you for being close to the CTA, and walking distance from so many other places, such as Walgreens, and Starbucks. Wonderful price, wonderful trip.
