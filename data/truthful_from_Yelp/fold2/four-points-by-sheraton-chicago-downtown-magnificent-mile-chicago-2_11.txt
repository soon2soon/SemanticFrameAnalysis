I have no complaints about this hotel.  I found a great deal on TravelZoo.  We paid practically nothing for 2 rooms on New Years Eve and parking was only half the price!  The rooms were definitely worth the price.  The staff was extremely friendly and hospitable.  I would high recommend this place!
