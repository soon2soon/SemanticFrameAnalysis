Half Acre is a must do for tourists and locals alike.  The place is awesome, and the beer tour is a great deal and a lot of fun. I've been on the beer tour twice now with two different groups of people, and both times - it's been informative and amazing.  The tap room is great, service is fast and the beer is of course great. Half Acre is known for it's Daisy Cutter - but there is a lot more great beer than just their #1!  Go to Half Acre, you will not be disappointed!
