Costa Rican Experts are exactly that - Experts right down to every detail.  My husband and my 2 very active daughters just returned from our 2nd trip with Costa Rican Experts and each time, we had an amazing experience for my husband and I and my high schooler and even our college age kid had a blast!  I was impressed with the little information I provided that they were able to plan a wonderful itinerary  for all to enjoy.  They secured drivers, and outfitting companies in Costa Rica that really take care of their guests, all in a very relaxed manner.  Our travel guide Brandon Hagg patiently listened to all of my requests till we got the trip just right, thank you Brandon!  It was obvious that Brandon like the other travel guides there have traveled extensively in Costa Rica and were able to tell me 1st hand about many experiences.  I highly recommend Costa Rican Experts.  Costa Rica is a beautiful country  - Don't miss the fun!
