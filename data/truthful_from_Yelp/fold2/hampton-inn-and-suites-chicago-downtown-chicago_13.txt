Partner and I arrived at 10:30 am although we knew check-in was at 4.  The desk took my cell # and promised to call when our room became available. We were able to visit and tour and grab some drinks while comfortable knowing they'd call when ready which they did as promised.  Everyone with the hotel was friendly and as helpful as possible, from the desk to concierge, doormen, valets and breakfast staff.  The staff kept a close eye on breakfast seating availability and quickly opened up one or both adjoining conference rooms if they suspected need. Breakfast food was plentiful and hot beverages available all day. Pool, hot tub, rooms were all clean and perfect with no complaints except for a slightly buggy tv (sound, slow channel changing) though the picture was sharp and bright and I was even able to attach my tablet to watch movies through my HDMI cable. All king rooms face the fire station but we were on the 11th floor and were not at all bothered hearing the infrequent sirens. So many great places to eat right around the hotel and within quick walking distance. Wireless Internet even on our high floor was strong and fast.  Two Cta stops just a couple of minutes walk away if that.   My primary reasons for choosing this hotel were location, breakfast and indoor pool/hot tub.  Those factors proved to be just icing on the cake In comparison to the tidiness of the hotel and the outstanding friendly staff.
