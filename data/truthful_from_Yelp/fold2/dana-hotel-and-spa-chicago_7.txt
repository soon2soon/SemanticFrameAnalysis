Beautiful hotel! I have stayed here 4+ times for work and it comes through every time. The architecture of the rooms is gorgeous and amazing in every room. My only recommendation is to not share rooms with friends because the showers are basically fishbowls that you can see right into. Makes for a fun time with your lady, but an awkward time with your boy. The bar at the top of the hotel is also a great time with fun bartenders. Definitely stay here if you are visiting Chicago.
