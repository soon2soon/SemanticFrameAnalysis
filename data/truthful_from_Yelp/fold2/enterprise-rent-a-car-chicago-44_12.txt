These guys are total gentlemen.  We rented a car back in late July this year when it was raining cats and dogs outside.  We were traveling with lots of luggage (10 day trip!) and our son who had just turned a year old.  The guy driving the shuttle pulled right up to our car and called someone from the office out to help us.  A guy showed up with the world's biggest umbrella and walked us to the car.  They certainly get a 10 on service from me!  Price was the best I could find, also.  Make sure you use a coupon from your entertainment book....ours saved us a bundle.
