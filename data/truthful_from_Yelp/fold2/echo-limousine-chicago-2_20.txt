My Mom was flying into Ohare on 1/28, one of those 40 below zero temp days. I couldn't pick her up and was extremely worried about her getting home given her age and frailty. No clue where to turn so I tried Yelp. Echo stood out with all of the 5 star reviews so right off the bat, my expectations were very high. I spoke with Pete who might be the most patient man on the planet. He answered about 25 questions on the phone and then some follow up questions via email. Bottom line, there was someone waiting at baggage claim for my Mom and he took care of her all the way to her doorstep. I even got a follow up report that everything went well. My Mom was very happy. Service was excellent in every way. Every promise was delivered. Thanks Echo, I'll be using you in the very near future. Readers, please let me know if you have any questions.
