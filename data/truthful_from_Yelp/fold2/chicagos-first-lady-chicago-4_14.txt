Based on a trip to Chicago last Oct.... The tour guide was very knowledgable  of the architecture of all the buildings. Best part is going under the bridges. Every seat on the boat gat an awesome view of the river.  I would totally go again. Love the views of the skyline.... Bucket list item.... Love Chicago!!!
