What is everyone talking about??? The only review related to the Airport Transit System at O'hare international is Bruce K. Everyone else is reviewing the CTA which has NOTHING to do with Airport Transit System (ATS). ATS is an internal transit system at O'hare international that runs between terminal 1, 2, 3, 5 and certain parking lots. I tried to find reviews of ATS to help my commute but there were none that were useful. So I am posting this review now to help those that are unfamiliar with ATS as I was until I finally used it. I needed to get to Terminal 5 from the blue line.  I knew I had to take ATS but didnt know how to get to the area to hop onto the internal transit system. Thankfully at the end of the blue line stop (at O'hare), there were signs on how to get to Terminal 5. Follow all the signs and it will show you to take ATS.  There is one point where the signs tell you to take the elevator up to the ATS area.  The automated trains come every 10 minutes. Super convenient and free!
