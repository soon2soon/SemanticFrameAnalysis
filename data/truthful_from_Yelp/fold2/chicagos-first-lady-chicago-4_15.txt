Friends of ours took us on this architectural boat tour of Chicago when we busted during the summer. We paid a little extra to get the photographer's trip where they stop and allow you time to frame and shoot. Their docents are known to be knowledgable and ours was no exception. Her knowledge of the city, its architecture and skyline, and stories were first rate. This trip was fun for the whole family and I would highly recommend as it was a highlight of our time in Chicago!
