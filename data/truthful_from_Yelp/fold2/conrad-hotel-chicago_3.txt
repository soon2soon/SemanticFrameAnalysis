As far as hotels I've stayed in in the city of Chicago (keeping in mind that I am A Hilton Honors Member and have tried nearly every hotel in the Hilton family in Chicago).  The Conrad ranks as second best behind the Waldorf.  From a value perspective I can't make the argument for staying at the Waldorf over the Conrad based on how the prices shake up. The best way I can explain the value is in a true dollar amount.  The Conrad is $60/night better than the Palmer House.  The Waldorf is $100/night better than the Conrad.  So with that being said unless the Conrad happens to fall within that sixty buck range of the Palmer House, I don't really book it. It's not because it really worth it, it's more that I don't need much of the amenities most of the time.   The 24 hour room service is a huge plus and they have great food there.  You can walk through to the mall without setting foot outside (If you're willing to wait quite a while on an elevator). The location is prime and right next to the Red line makes it super convienent to get to.  It is definitely on my short list of places to stay when I spend a night in Chicago.
