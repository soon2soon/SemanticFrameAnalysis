For the price, the hotel experience just doesn't get any better than this.  In essence, if you are in the Chicago area and looking for a place to stay that isn't your Auntie Gemma's couch, I'd take a look at the Embassy Suites Downtown/Lakefront. A few tidbits of information that would have been very helpful for me to know before staying, and will hopefully improve your experience: - Complimentary hot breakfast (including made to order omelettes, including egg whites) from 7-9:30am on weekdays, and 7:30-10am on weekends.  Fairly consistent options every day, including eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, french toast, pastries, yogourt, some fruit (bananas/apples/oranges/sliced cantaloupe), cereals etc.  It is a busy area, so I'd advise going early. - Complimentary manager's happy hour from 5:30-7pm daily.  Free drinks, and snacks (e.g., hummus, salsa chips).  How can you beat that? - There are multiple Embassy Suites in Chicago, so make sure you are looking at this location.  It is within very reasonable walking distance to all points of interest.  5 minutes to Navy Pier, 5 minutes to Mag Mile, 25 minutes to Sears Tower etc.  Could not have been happier with the location. - Grocery store (Dominick's) directly across the street.  Helps you make use of the mini-fridge in your suite. - Suites are very large.  I'm not sure about other people who are complaining about noise coming from the inside of the hotel (due to its open layout).  If you close the bedroom door, you couldn't hear a thing.  Some street noise if you are on a lower floor, but this is downtown Chicago.  Come on.  Complaining about that is about as smart as bitching about getting wet at the beach. - 5 minute walk from Red Line L. - The staff are either all very happy to work there, or they feed them lots of cocaine before their shifts.  Everyone was upbeat, and happy to serve, which is most definitely not the case at every hotel.  Loved the people.
