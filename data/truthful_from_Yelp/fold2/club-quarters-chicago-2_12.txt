I stayed here two years ago for Lollapalooza, and it was awesome!  I booked well in advance, and scored $99/night for Friday + Saturday, which is INSANE for Lollapalooza weekend.  My room was the size of a shoebox, but I didn't care as I was hardly in the room... I was watching bands and partying!  Even better is the festival allowed sealed water bottles into the festival, and this hotel had unsealed water bottles for you to take for free!  Not only did I get to bring in free water, but I may or may not have smuggled in a clear alcoholic liquid in masquerading as water.
