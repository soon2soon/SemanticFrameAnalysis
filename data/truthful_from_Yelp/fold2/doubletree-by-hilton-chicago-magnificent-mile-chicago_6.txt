This hotel was perfect. We traveled two days to get to Chicago, and by the time we got in I was tired and in need of a long shower. We got to the hotel around 10 am. Our plan was to check the bags, and come back at 3pm to check in. We went up to the counter expecting to hear to come back, but to our surprise we were able to check in. I can not express how much it meant to us. Of course, the cookie was amazing. The location was great. The room was spacious, and clean. We did not spend much time at the hotel, but what little interactions we had with the staff was pleasant. I got a deal on Hotwire, but even if I had paid full price it would have still been worth it. Also, about a block away from Yolk. A must eat for breakfast. Will be staying here whenever in the Chicago area.
