Wow!  We actually got 'stuck' in Chicago due to weather and all the airport hotels were booked. I was able to book the Dana last minute through Priceline. It was late, we were exhausted, freezing and hungry after flying from San Diego with a three year old, all of us in warm weather clothes (it was 10 degrees in Chicago!).  The Dana had everything we needed and more. The hotel mini bar has drinks (sodas, large Voss waters, beer) and snacks that are very well priced - NO mark up whatsoever!!!! We were so pleasantly surprised! There is a beautiful hanging wine rack in your room with about 12 bottles to choose from, from which you can pick whatever kind you like, and just open it. The wine had NO markup either. A $20 bottle in the store, is $20 at The Dana, to have in the convenience of your room. They call it an 'honor' bar, so when you check out you tell them what you ate or drank. We were honest, so I'm not sure if they actually charge you later if you are not honest. It was around 11:30pm and being a smaller hotel we were worried there would be no food options, but they have 24 Hr room service!  The burger sliders were excellent! The one downside, which may have just been our room, was something made a lot of noise during the night. I think it was coming from our fridge - not exactly sure- we were too tired to check it out!  But other than that, we were very impressed and would definitely go back!
