BEST WAY TO GET AROUND CHICAGO! My boyfriend and I decided to get this because of the "hop on and off" option. BEST idea ever. We were able to tour most of the city, weather was perfect, and the tour guides were funny and answered all our questions. One of the lady tour guides recommended Portillo's for best Chicago style hot dogs and she was right! I recommend taking the double decker bus and getting off at stop 12 to get to Portillos. Also, you have two options when you buy the pass: 1.Taking the Signature Tour in the double decker buses that give you a guided city tour. We stayed on for all the stops our first time which helped us get familiar with the city. 2.Taking 3 types of Trolleys which do Neighborhood Tours "NORTH, WEST, and SOUTH" Â Highly recommend doing all, but if you don't have that much time, North has the prettiest neighborhood. Overall: WORTH IT! $90 for 2 people BUT its a 3day pass + Free T-shirt for each person + Coupons for restaurants and other tourist attractions like Skydeck + You can use it as much as you want. Tour guides gave us accurate, useful and funny information, learned so much and fell in love with Chicago. Great to use instead of taxis. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. :)
