With having our church, reception and multiple picture locations in the city for our wedding, we were nervous about all the logistics involved with the three trolleys we booked. We had one for our guests from the hotel to the church and back, a bridal party one for pictures around the city and to and from both events and a late night one back to the hotel. With so many moving parts we were extremely happy with how smoothly everything went. They were not only on time, they were early everywhere they needed to be. John was our main contact the whole time and was very helpful in responding to emails quickly and sending the necessary paperwork. He also made some last minute changes for us very easily. We would recommend them to any bride and groom looking for a unique form of wedding transportation.
