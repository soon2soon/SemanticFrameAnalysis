Third time using ChiTown Party Bus and they do not disappoint!  Took a group of 20 on MacDaddy on Saturday night for my Birthday Extravaganza to Ron of Japan.  Driver was the bomb, helping me with Boarding Treats for my Guests!  He stood outside the bus in the freezing cold and offered Champagne and Shots in Chocolate Shot glasses to my guest. It was the party of the year and its only February!  Will definitely hire ChiTown Party Bus again.
