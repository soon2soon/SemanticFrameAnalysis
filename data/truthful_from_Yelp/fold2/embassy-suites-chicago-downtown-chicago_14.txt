Staying on a budget with a family in Chicago, this is the place to go. Â I got a great price, plus the savings and convenience of a full, free breakfast each morning. We packed a lot of activity into three days, so we didn't hang around the hotel very much, but the kids were thoroughly impressed. Great location, near the red line, within walking distance of many attractions, and less than a $10 cab ride everywhere else.
