love this place. I got a very good deal from Hotwire of $132/night at mid-March. I came to Chicago to apply Schengen visa and the consulate general was just 3 house number away, it won't take you more than a minute to get there! The most surprising part is that the Nordstorm is just downstairs, I did not even have to go out in the street to do shopping! I did not try the food in the hotel but there are some really good restaurant nearby: if you would like some seafood, there are Eddie V's Prime Seafood and Joe's seafood, one is right next to the rush St. Side gate and one is cross the street; if you enjoy Chinese/Asian food, Lao Sze Chuan is at the corner of the block; If you prefer French food, I will recommend Les Nomades. As for the hotel itself, the room is spatial and comfortable, I really like the bathroom design that separate the toilet from the shower into a smaller room. The best part is: free WiFi! I am really disappointed that many high end hotels do not provide free wifi in guest room. I don't mind spend a bit of money on wifi but the thing is, for the most of the day I was outside and it is just a waste of money to pay 24 hr pass for 3 hr use. In short, I am more than satisfied with this hotel. Highly recommended!
