I stayed at this brand new Fairfield Inn last friday to sunday and was extremely happy with the hotel.  The location is about 20 minutes walk to Navy Pier and less than 10 minutes walk to Michigan Avenue. It's also near all the major restaurants, bars, and shops.  I checked in on Friday and was told that the hotel just openned Thursday.  Everything was great and new.  The staff were professional, helpful, and nice, especially Matthew at the front desk.  Thank you Matthew and Amber.  I would totally go back again next time I am in Chicago.  Awesome location and staff.
