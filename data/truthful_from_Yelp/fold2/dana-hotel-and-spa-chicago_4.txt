My girlfriend and I spent the night there for Valentine's day and were not disappointed. I got a serene king room with a spa and dinner/club giftcard so I would say I got an awesome deal for my money. We were put all the way up on the 23rd floor. The room was beautiful as was the view. (Too bad it was too cold to fully appreciate the balcony!) The king sized bed was super comfortable and the bathroom had this great rainfall shower. It also came with a well stocked mini-bar! Room service was prompt and delicious. It was quite possibly one of the best hotel rooms I've spent a night in. As to the rest of the hotel - the spa and restaurant's design were comfortable but modern. All workers were friendly and helpful, especially at the front desk. Our server at the restaurant forgot about running us the check when it got busy but there were only two people on the floor including himself so I would say it wasn't that big of a deal. We didn't go to the club due to early spa appointments, but we could hear it from our room - our balcony was only a floor or so under it so that was to be expected. Maybe next time we'll actually go check it out. Overall: I had a very relaxing swedish massage at the spa and it was the perfect weekend getaway. The only thing I could have wanted for is a longer stay!
