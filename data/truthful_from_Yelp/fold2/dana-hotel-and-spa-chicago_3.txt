From arrival to departure and everything in between, the Dana Hotel was simply AMAZING!!! Rooms: WOW! The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and clean!! They have all the amenities you could possibly want and need including an impressive selection of wines and snacks at a very reasonable price!! Meeting Space: I have never been in a meeting room with the amazing views that the Dana Hotel offers. The meetings team is so accommodating and hospitable and goes above and beyond to make sure everyone is comfortable! Food and Beverage Options: The restaurant on the ground level (Freestyle) is ridiculously good! The menu variety was great and the prices were low. We were happy to eat almost every meal at the hotel. Room service was also fantastic, quick and friendly service. And who can forget the roof top bar, Vertigo! As a hotel guest, you get priority access to the club! Great drinks, great music, and fantastic venue! It is amazing to see how they can operate a popular club without affecting the hotel guest's experience! We had no challenges with crowds or noise and we stayed on the 21st floor, only 5 or so floors below the club. The Hotel Staff: The hotel and its amenities are fantastic, but the thing that makes the Dana Hotel the only option when staying in Chicago is the hotel's staff! Everyone is so nice and so accommodating! From the restaurant to housekeeping to Front Office, Everyone goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of! HUGE thank you and shout out to Audrey in Sales! The only amenity I was unable to experience during my stay was the Spa. This WILL be on my to do list for my next visit to the Dana Hotel. Thank you to everyone at the Dana Hotel that made this visit to Chicago absolutely unforgettable!!
