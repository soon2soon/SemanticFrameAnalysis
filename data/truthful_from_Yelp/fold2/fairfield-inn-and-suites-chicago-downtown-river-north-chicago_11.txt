Simply amazing! Our flight was delayed so we had to check in super late and they had no problems accommodating us. Their customer service is exceptional. All the staffs were super friendly and nice. They made our stay very welcoming. We had the one king room and it was clean and cozy. The location is in the heart of downtown. There are bars, restaurants, shops all around, so everything is conveniently within walking distance. Great stay, price and service. Well worth it!
