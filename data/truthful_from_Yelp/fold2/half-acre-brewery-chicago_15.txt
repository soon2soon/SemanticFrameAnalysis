Eh-snap!  I kind of love Half Acre.  I'll admit, I'm not always a fan of the beers, but the service here is great.  Typically, you'll find the same 2 guys filling up your growlers and they are some of the friendliest guys you'll meet!  This must be a theme at Half Acre, because I kind of really like everyone who works next door in the tap room too. Want to try a beer before you buy it?  Just ask for a taste!  Want to try several beers?  Go for it!  They'll tell you everything they can about every beer available without any sort of beer snobbery or condescending tone.  They're attentive to every customer, quick and all around friendly people.  I can't complain.   One time I left my credit card because I got so caught up in taking stickers (yes, apparently I'm still 5)...but I also left the stickers.  We had a nice laugh about it.  Tuesdays are $2 off growlers and $1 off howlers and I don't know about you, but that sure is a nice little pick me up after a Monday.
