Used echo for the first time from midway to downtown hotel and the driver was there before our plane landed.  How do I know he texted me.  We were constant contact till we got our bag and then walked to the limo pickup place and he was right there.  Easy too book easy to find and great ride would use them next time in Chicago!!!!
