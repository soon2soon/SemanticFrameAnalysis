I can't say enough good things about City Segway Tours!  If you have any hesitation about learning the Segway and doing the tour, I am here to tell you that your worries will go away within minutes of getting on it.  It really is a very simple, intuitive machine that is fun to drive and a great way to see the city.   We did the 3 hour tour with Kyle as our guide.  He was informative, easy going and great all around guy!  We got a great view lots of the sites and got some great skyline pictures in areas I am not sure we would have wondered to on our own.   Seriously, do the Segway tour!! I it is so much fun!
