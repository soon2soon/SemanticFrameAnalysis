We arrived late at night tired & sleepy & were asked to wait more than 1 hour before the front desk person finally got us settled in a room.  I was wondering why wait that long when the room was marked 'available' when I booked it.  It was a little disappointing; however,  I guess, we were re-directed to a much bigger & better room.  I am sure that was not what I have reserved.  I was not expecting a room with a big living room, a dining table for 6 & 2 TVs:).  We got lucky after being stuck in the train for 4days due to an avalanche.  It was like a treat. We love the location as it is very close to downtown Chicago highlights like Navy Pier & Wrigley building.  The building is unique with an Asian touch.  I love the relaxing breakfast area in the lobby with the bamboo decors.  It makes you feel like you're outdoors.  They serve hot & cold breakfast buffet style with wide variety of food choices.  I can't wait to go back there!!!
