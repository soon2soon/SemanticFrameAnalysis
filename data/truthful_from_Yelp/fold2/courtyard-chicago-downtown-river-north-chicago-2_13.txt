We just used this hotel for our wedding hotel block.  They went above and beyond anything we expected, from sending us champagne to having a digital light display "Congratulations to the Newlyweds" on their lobby wall on our way out.  They were so accommodating to our guests.  The rooms are very standard for a Marriott but perfect for what we needed.  They recently revamped their lobby to look very modern and added "Davanti Enoteca" as their main restaurant, which is SO GOOD.  They were so amazing to us with room upgrades, flexible checkouts, extra help for family members and anything else we needed.  Our guests also enjoyed the fact that they have a pool and an outdoor terrace, as well as being situated so close to everything.  The only downfall is that parking is very expensive ($57/night) but there isn't a hotel in the area with cheaper parking.  They were nice enough to recommend parking garages in the area, though it made more sense to park at the hotel as they have in/out service.  We highly recommend staying here!
