My friend and I always stop here for brunch - we usually stick with the Roasted Endive Salad (blue cheese mousse, pickled apples, dressed in a date vinaigrette; the endives are slightly bitter but sweet, and the whole dish is very fresh with the vinaigrette), Bacon and Onion Buns French Toast with Bourbon Aged Maple Syrup (a nice little twist of sweet and savory from the bacon and onion buns but with the sweet maple syrup), Wagyu Skirt Steak and Eggs (the steak is very tender and nicely marinated), and their cheese and cured meats spread (Parmesan, brie, capicola, salami, and prosciutto).  The service is always wonderful and attentive, and the view is quite nice if you are seated by the window.  A very elegant place!  I miss their AYCE brunch specials that they have (they had American and Asian-inspired cuisine) that was quite marvelous, but I am not sure if it lost its popularity. +AYCE brunch options (Mediterranean or Asian)
