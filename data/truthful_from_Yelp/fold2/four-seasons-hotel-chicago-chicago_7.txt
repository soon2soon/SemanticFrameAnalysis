As ALWAYS the Four Seasons stands head and shoulders above the competition! Â Sure, it's not cheap but this is the kind of place where exclusivity shines! The concierge hooked us up with a private club atop a highrise! Thank you also to the chauffeur and butler. The suite, the stay - all excellent! See you next trip!
