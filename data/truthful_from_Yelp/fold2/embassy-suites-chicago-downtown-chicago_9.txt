My girlfriend and I had a great time here, breakfast was good, and you can't go wrong with free drinks. The room was clean and was well taken care of, we paid 115 for the room and we were not disappointed. Our room also had a great city view overlooking the city and the hotel had many thing to do around it. The open atrium style hotel was very cool. I didn't try the pool because it was already cold outside. Other than the long wait times for the elevators I have no complaints and would recommend this place to everyone.
