Obtaining visas can be stressful, especially when planning multiple countries months in advance. I found China Visa Services to be straightforward and easy to use. Just send in your passport with the necessary documents. The online instructions were simple and their office called me as soon as my passport arrived to see if I wanted the express option. 2 days later it was ready to be picked up or Fed-Ex'd to me. They do charge a high fee for the service, but it's worth it to avoid the in person process.
