Excellent time on the Loop tour.  Lauren emailed the day before with details of the tour and her contact info.  She managed a large group with finesse.  Never had a problem hearing or following her.  We saw things that I have not seen in any guide books and would totally have missed (specifically interiors of some of the buildings).  She had a great sense of humor and was willing to offer advice on other activities in Chicago.  The two hours went by very quickly and I was sad for the tour to end.  Highly recommended.   ps  although the tour is free, you are encouraged to tip the tour guide whatever you think the tour is worth.
