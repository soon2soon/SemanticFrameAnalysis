This is a great hotel to stay at in downtown Chicago, within walking distance of many places when the weather is nice. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and clean. It offers a managers reception in the main lobby, which is large and well decorated, that is a great treat after a long day. The complimentary breakfast offers a lot of variety of cooked to order options. The guy who makes the omelets is a pro. The customer service is great. Amanda at the front desk was legitimately the most helpful person I've encountered at any business. She stayed more then half an hour after finishing work just to give advice on where to go on a Saturday night to a few out of town college students. When you look young it's hard to get any sort of decent service, but Amanda went far beyond what was necessary and it was very much appreciated.
