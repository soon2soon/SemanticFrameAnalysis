The room is your average room for Chicago but the staff are incredible. We were with a small group of about a dozen people for a week. We had no particular special requests so as to make ourselves known but the employees learned our names and would even ask us in the bar -- by name -- how we were enjoying the stay. The maid service was more than just a quick vacuum. I had piled dirty clothes on the floor in the closet and they were placed into a laundry bag when I returned. All of my toiletries were laid on a clean towel rather than the counter surface. This is a top-notch operation.
