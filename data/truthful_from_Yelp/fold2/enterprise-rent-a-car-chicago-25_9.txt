This place is very close by where I live and I have used them on a couple occasions when I was car-less and needed to drive out of town. They will pick you up from your place and drive you to their location so that you can efficiently get in and out with your vehicle without having to cab or public transit to get there. The staff has always been very friendly and the cars are nice and clean when you pick them up and smell good. The guy that does pick up and drop off is a retiree who just uses this job as a filler, and he is a sweetheart. They have always gotten me in and out of there quickly, and have always picked me up / dropped me off when need be. They also upgraded me one time with no charge because they had too many vehicles out during that particular weekend. Highly recommend this particular location for fast and friendly service, and a great reliable ride if you need one.
