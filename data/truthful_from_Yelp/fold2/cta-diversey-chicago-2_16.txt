OK this isnt a taxi cab and at $2 it shouldnt be. maybe you have to wait 15 minutes...not a big deal. Just start riding the red line on a frequent basis and you will throw your body at this train like it was your savior. Its actually clean, safe, and has an amazing view of the city. When i have out-of-town guests i tell them to ride this train as a tourist attraction. The fact i have never seen a pile of puke on this train earns it the 5 stars!
