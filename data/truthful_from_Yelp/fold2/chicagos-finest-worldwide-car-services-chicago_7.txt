On occasions when I need to hire a car, safety and comfort are key. This is first class service from the moment you are picked up until you are dropped off - any destination. Would I like a Starbucks latte to be waiting for me in the car for a 6AM pick up or sparkling water with a twist of lime to be my refreshment on the way home from the airport? YES thank you ! - It's standard procedure to cater to the clients needs with this very reasonably priced service company. David DePluzer and his team make it happen. They provide the little extras. I trust Chicago's Finest Limo to pick my parents up in a sedan or to drop of my kid sisters family off, luggage and all, on time and safely. They are know my exclusive car service for my precious family members. We have switched to Chicago's Finest Limousine at my office as well. They are Chicago grown, a small business with excellent service.
