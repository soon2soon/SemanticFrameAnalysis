First rental car experience; regardless good business is good business. Here good business was communicated immediately as a well-dressed employee smiled and greeted us at the door; he then offered us bottles of water. On a hot day, when you're walking from the shuttle bus (excellent service too) to Enterprise water is the perfect compliment! There was a line to wait, but if you go to a good restaurant you'll find lines... It's understandable. This review in particular was inspired by the excellent service provided by John Wantiez. He found us the car I requested, and always treated us with respect. It helped that he was funny as well! From the start, I felt this Enterprise reflected hospitality, and I was satisfied with the price. 5 Stars Enterprise! 5 Stars indeed!
