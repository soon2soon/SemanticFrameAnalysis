I have nothing but excellent things to say about Global Adrenaline.  My mother-in-law loves to travel, but we worry about her traveling by herself in foreign countries. When we found Global Adrenaline, we were thrilled as they provided everything we were looking for in the way of a comprehensive, fun, educational, safe, and inspiring group trip for her.  As we saw firsthand through the planning process, GA is detailed, efficient, and takes excellent care of their customers. My mother-in-law enjoyed a 10-day trip-of-a-lifetime through Turkey, from Istanbul to Cappadocia and finally to Bodrum along the coast.  One month later, she is still talking about the amazing culture, gorgeous hotels, exquisite sights, delicious food, and historical tidbits she encountered along the way. Five stars for the service level, attention to detail, customer care and overall enrichment Global Adrenaline provides for those seeking additional passport stamps.
