In regards to my last review I wanted to give an update. Being in sales and customer service I understand that mistakes do happen. They didn't have my correct email address and this is a busy season. However once I received a call from the company we got the miscommunication squared away. I was personally impressed with Charlie's (not a frat boy haha) professionalism and follow up. I don't have any reasons for not coming back to this company for future rentals.
