This was the best rental car experience I have ever had. I was getting body work done on my car and Ariel at enterprise took amazing care of me. She initiated contact with me about picking me up from the body shop, set me up with a great clean car, and even called me to come back right after I left because someone returned the car that I really wanted to rent. Ariel gave great customer service and overall great experience at enterprise.
