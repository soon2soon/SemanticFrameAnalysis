I love this hotel! Â The staff is attentive and outstanding in service. Most have been there for years which is a true asset to the management and to the hotel. Cleaning staff does an excellent job keeping the place spotless and the breakfast crew is very efficient. Have stayed before and will continue to stay here whenever I am in the Windy City!
