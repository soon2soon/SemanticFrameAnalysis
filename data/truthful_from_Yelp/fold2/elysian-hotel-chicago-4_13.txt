This place is so GANGSTER! They don't play around. My favorite part of the place was how the people were not in the least bit pretentious...i mean some of the guests were...but the workers were so nice and down to earth. We got one of their biggest suites, and were not in the least bit disappointed. The room was so nice. I used the spa both days I was there and was treated like a star. If you want to drop some coin on a nice hotel, this is the spot to do it.
