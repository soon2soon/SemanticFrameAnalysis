Called the day we were checking in to see if we could check in before four. Told possibly two. We could lock our stuff in the lock room if we wanted to start our day in the city. We got to hotel shortly after noon. Expected to just lock up our stuff. The check in desk told us our room was ready. Pays to call ahead. We got our stuff to room and hit the city. Came back later to swim. Pool was nice, just very messy when we got there. It was apparently very busy that day. The terrace outside the pool is a very nice area to sit and relax. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Whenever we called down for something, they got it to us immediately. Always smiling and ready to help out or answer questions. The staff in the breakfast area was on the ball also. everything was hot and fresh and filled. Coffee was good and a large selection of tea. Our family enjoyed the breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.
