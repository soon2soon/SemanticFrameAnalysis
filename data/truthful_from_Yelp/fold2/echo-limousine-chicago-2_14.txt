I used Echo Limousine for a trip home from O'Hare. I booked online, which was very easy and I had no problems. I was contacted via email immediately and an issue I had with ordering car seats had been corrected. The driver was there before my flight even landed. I had received the driver's name and cell phone number in an email, so I called and coordinated with the driver. Later I had to text, and the driver responded promptly and professionally. The pick-up was great and went very smoothly, which is no small feat with two suitcases, two kids and one adult. The driver dealt with the bags and the car seats were exactly as I ordered. The vehicle was clean and comfortable, and the drive went very well. The driver handled two small children who were very tired of traveling like a pro. The drop-off was quick and simple. I would definitely use them again.
