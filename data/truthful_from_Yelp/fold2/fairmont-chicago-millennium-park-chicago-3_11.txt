Excellent service from beginning to end! We had a voucher for two free nights, so I can't speak for the price. We asked about available upgrades, and the nice lady at the check in desk upgraded us for free. We had a wonderful view and had the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. It was easy to walk to all of the popular Chicago destinations. The housekeeping staff was excellent as well by making sure our room was beyond well stocked with amenities when we declined housekeeping and she met us in the hall. Last, but not least, the concierge staff went far and beyond to suggest the best routes, hail a cab, or recommend the best hot dog. Would definitely stay here again!
