As I understand it, Chicago's First Lady is the only tour that is narrated by the Chicago Architecture Foundation.  Even though I'm not into architecture, I thought it would be nice to learn about Chicago's architecture and to pick up a few history lessons along the way.  Yep, this tour delivered! Our guide was super knowledgeable but also had some fascinating personal stories to tell.   Of course Chicago is always cold and windy but we sat on the top deck right behind the pilot house hoping it would block some of the wind.  Overall, that plan worked and it put us close to the volunteer docent who narrated the tour.  I noticed that none of the other tour boats were nearly as full as ours, some I'm convinced this is a hot ticket.  I've been told this tour is more technical than some of the tours offered by other boat companies so if you want to float down the river with your kids, another company's tour might be a better fit. I'd recommend taking warmer clothes than you think you'll need.  Expect it to be 10 degrees cooler on the boat then on Michigan Avenue.  Burrrrrrrrrr. If you enjoy the tour, don't forget to tip your volunteer guide. :-)
