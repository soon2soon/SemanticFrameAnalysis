I stayed there for a night and I'm sad I had to leave. The lobby is beautiful and meticulously maintained. There's a terrace on the fifth floor where the lobby/check-in is located, a full service restaurant and bar, gym, pool, and dem free interwebs. The room was huge - tub and shower separate - and the bed/bedding was amazing. One of the nicest hotels I've been in stateside at 4 stars.
