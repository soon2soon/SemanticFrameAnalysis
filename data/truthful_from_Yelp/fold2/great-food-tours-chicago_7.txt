Had an amazing chocolate tour, stopped at places that were a lot more "authentic" and local to Chicago. It was a great way to see a little bit of the Michigan Ave area and hear some of the history and trivia about Chicago. Our tour guide Seth was amazing! He was very funny and informative. Our only complaint for the tour is that it is not a stroller/kid friendly tour. Although our tour guide was extremely accommodating and assistive.
