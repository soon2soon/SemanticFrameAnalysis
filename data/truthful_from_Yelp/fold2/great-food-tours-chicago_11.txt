Dear Chicago, the chocolate tour will not disappoint.  I used the code Seth50 and received half off my purchase at greatfoodtours.com/gft/u…. Saw this tour happening one day and asked about it.  Turns out the tour guide's name was Seth and he told me about the code.  My sister and I enjoyed the Valrona cupcake from More, Black Pearl from Voseges, and Chocolate 4 Donut at Glazed.  Seth is funny and teaches you a lot about the history and culture of the city as he takes you from shop to shop.  Highly recommend this as a gift to someone.
