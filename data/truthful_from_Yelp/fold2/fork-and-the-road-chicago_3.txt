My friends purchased the "Unsung Chicago Classics tour" (August 30, 2009) for my birthday. It was a beautiful day, and the places we stopped at were terrific: Maxwell St. Market for Mexican food, flamb√©ed saganaki at the Parthenon in Greektown (accompanied with tasty Tzatziki & non-Kronos Gyro meat!), and then the to-die-for Jibarito at Boriquen in Humboldt Park. The jibarito is sandwich made with flattened, double deep-fried green plantains instead of bread and also contains a delicious garlic mayo. It is a Puerto Rican specialty of Chicago (inspired by a similar sandwich in Puerto Rico) and made for an excellent end to the tour. Sharon and Dimitra were terrific leaders, and their vast knowledge of the culinary scene in Chicago made this day as much a lesson in further restaurants to visit as a tour of under-appreciated Chicago gems. The only downside to the tour was that we had to follow traffic laws (fully stopping and waiting at red lights, etc.), which can become cumbersome in a medium-sized group (though I recognize there is no legal way around this for the company). For similar reasons, consuming alcohol is also prohibited. [However, nothing prevents you from recreating a tour later while consuming libations at your own risk.] I wholeheartedly recommend any and all of the tours to anyone who loves cycling, loves food, or simply wants to explore new areas of Chicago. I've noticed that publicity and good reviews lead the tours to sell out quickly, so make sure to book as far in advance as possible for the new offerings of the 2011 season.
