These people kick ass!!! we rode the shuttle from the airport and the driver was friendly and gracious. She handled Mom's bag but I took mine onboard and stowed it. We arrived at the rental lot and she unloaded Mom's bag and we tipped her and went inside. Inside we were greeted by two people and one of them took us to the counter where we discussed our reservation and the other ran off and quickly returned with complimentary bottles of cold water!! How nice is THAT?? It really doesn't take much to please me. The first guy takes us out to find a vehicle and it seems I have a couple choices. My priority was something with a USB port to plug in my phone and listen to my music! Ok, the Ford Fusion it is! It's nice! Black with leather and Sync (which later I didn't like as much as in the beginning) They couldn't have made the process any quicker or easier. I picked a car... he typed it in on the iPad.. We went inside for a receipt and keys.. DONE!!!! less than 15 minutes and FAR less expensive than any other airport location rental car lot. Siri, get me to Michigan please! Oh, and use Google Maps. The Apple app sucks! The return process!! We pull up and into the return driveway... get in the line under the canopy and they come running to unload our bags and check us in ion the iPad. At this point you have two options. LEave it on the card you used for the deposit and get an immediate receipt or use a different card (or cash) and go inside for a somewhat lengthy process. Well, it seemed lengthy while I waited outside with the bags by the shuttle stop but I'm impatient. Within a few minutes we were bouncing along in the shuttle on our way to Terminal 2 with a very pleasant rental experience behind us!! Thanks again Enterprise!!!!
