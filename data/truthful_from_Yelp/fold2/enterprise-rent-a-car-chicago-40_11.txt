The car I own recently had some mechanical issues that left me stranded and in a rather stressful situation. Â Both Keegan and Clark were so patient, solution oriented, efficient and helpful through the entire rental process from figuring out things to my insurance to the check-in and return process. Thank you so much for making an otherwise painful process absolutely painless!
