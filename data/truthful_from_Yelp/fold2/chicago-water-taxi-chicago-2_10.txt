I'm on a boat, b*tch! $7 for a round trip? Priceless. My friend and I had wanted to take one of the boats along the Chicago river during our week long stay in the city.  Our last day in town we had the time, though no one else in our group thought it was as cool so they bailed.  Well, they missed out! It's about an hour long ride from magnificent mile to Chinatown and back.  You get amazing views of all the architecture and the little restaurants/bars along the way.  It would be cool if there was a tour guide, but I guess you can pay an extra $20 for that with another boat service.  Ballin' on a budget.. I don't know if this is a great method of transportation if you had to use it for practicality.
