This is my home away from home. The location makes everything so convenient. The service is top notch... From the bell men, check in, bartenders, and wait staff. The beds are comfy, always a clean room, and I love the size of the bathrooms. The rooftop bar is wonderful when the weather is nice! See you soon!! I have to give a thumbs up on the recent renovations to the lobby and bar area! They have opened up the bar to create more seating which is very inviting! This might make saying no to one final night cap exceptionally difficult! Cheers!
