I'm in Chicago on business a few times a year. I'd been using a car service (who will remain nameless!) that had been late and I had to trek all over the airport with my heavy bags to find the car, they were rude, etc, etc. I switched to Chicago's Finest because of the yelp reviews and I have to admit I was a bit cynical about it as I've had such poor experiences with car services but BOY was I glad found these guys! Rolling off a long flight to find someone in bag claim (this was after my flight arrived early!) with a sign with my name on it who was friendly and helpful - just so nice. He had parked super close by and he took EXCELLENT care of me. On my return trip to the airport, David himself (the owner) chauffeured me - great guy! This is a company that truly understands the art of customer service and what it means to take care of people in such a way to keep them coming back. They go the extra mile for their clients and it shows - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
