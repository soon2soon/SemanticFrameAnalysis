No, this isn't just another Enterprise location.  I've been regularly renting from this Midway airport location for the past 10 years and have had nothing but impeccable service!  Enterprise had originally won me over when I was 16 because Budget was the only other company that would rent to me due to my age but they were JERKS!!  I've tried other companies and other locations but none have been able to compare.  There was even that time I returned a PT Cruiser pretty dented up, handed the keys over and was on my way in less than 5 minutes!  I've never had to worry about any aspect of my reservation and usually get a free upgrade.  This staff Rocks!
