Fun & informative!  Great way to see the hi-lights of Chicago and hear some history as well as local perspective on Chicago culture and politics.    The Segway itself was easy and fun to ride.   Our guide Clark was friendly and knowledgeable.  The fact that we have a spectacular sunny fall day didn't hurt.  Highly recommend!
