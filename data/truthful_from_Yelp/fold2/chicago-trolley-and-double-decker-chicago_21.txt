Tip: Pre-order tickets for this trip online. You can save some loot by doing so! Also, make sure you print the email receipt of the ticket purchase or else there's no way of the ticket reps to show proof of purchase. Onto the review... my experience with this company was wonderful! The staff, tour guides and bus drivers were all so friendly! The first tour guide we who was obviously knowledgeable about the city also gave me some great recommendations on places to check out in terms of pizza and live music. He was witty and really got into it with the crowd on the bus! One of the best parts of going through this place is that your ticket lasts for 2 additional days. It was perfect, since I was visiting Chitown during the weekend. I had purchased the tickets for Friday and was able to use them up until Sunday! I mean it makes sense, right? You can't see the whole city in just one day, so it's perfect. Overall, great experience that I definitely recommend to anyone new in the city that's lookin to get a good view of the city!
