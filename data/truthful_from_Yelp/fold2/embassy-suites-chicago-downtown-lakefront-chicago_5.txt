We stayed here in February.  Very satisfied.  Clean, well appointed rooms and lobby.  Comfortable beds and quiet.  Included is a morning cooked to order breakfast - a real treat with everything you might want and then some.  Also, included is an evening manager's reception with light fare and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Hotel also has a lap pool and a fitness room.  Staff was wonderful.  Looking forward to our next visit here.  I recommend this hotel to anyone.
