I highly highly highly recommend Costa Rica Experts.   The last word in their name is there for a reason-- they truly are experts in all things Costa Rica.  I had done quite a bit of research going into this trip and had a not- so- positive experience with a different travel agent before finding and settling on CRE.  Once I found these guys, everything fell into place.  They knew all the right excursion companies to work with, and knew the answers to trickier questions like coordinating travel and driving options there in the country.  Every single thing they arranged for us turned out great-- and they really chose terrific excursion companies in Costa Rica because we LOVED all the guides who took us around.  Now, there is one more major reason why I recommend CRE.  Upon our return we had a very unexpected and very strange problem getting two pieces of our luggage back to the states (which had nothing to do with CRE).  Long story short, CRE took control of the situation and resolved this for us in the most understanding and professional manner.  It was a problem that lasted three full weeks upon our return, and they were totally on it, staying in touch with me almost daily with phone calls and emails.  They did not have to do this-- they could have said it was our problem (after all, our trip with them was complete).  But they went above and beyond and acted like the true professionals they are.  Our bags finally arrived safe and sound-- thanks to CRE.  I have never written a yelp review like this before, but I wanted to sing their praises because they honestly and truly deserve it.  Thank you, CRE.
