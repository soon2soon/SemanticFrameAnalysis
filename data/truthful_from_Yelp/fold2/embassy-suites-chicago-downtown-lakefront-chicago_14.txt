My husband and I travel often and have stayed in many Embassy Suites. This one is our favorite. They offer a cook to order breakfast, continental and buffet. Food is very good and lots of it. Our room is roomy and very nice. Lots of pillows and quite. From 5-7 they have free open bar and light snacks. Would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to downtown Chicago.
