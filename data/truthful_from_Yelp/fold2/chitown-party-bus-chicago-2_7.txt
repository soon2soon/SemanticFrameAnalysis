Just partied on the big daddy on 12/21 and it was amazing! had such blast. Chris was amazing and never yelled at my party for being late or loud. Pros: arrived on time I think 5 min early. provided ice, cups and napkins beer bong! ski shot thingy poles sound system big cooler cool lights even had garbage bags and cans! tips: still buy a little more ice to cover the top of your drinks. I bought 3 extra bags. we literally had no plan since most my guests were late (we were supposed to drive to Naperville by 7 for an event that ended at 8.) so we ended up Â just parting on bus in downtown chicago. He made a stop at mcdonalds so we could use the bathroom, drove us to navy pier for a cute picture moment and also to soldier field. all without me even asking. Chris knows what hes doing. Thanks so so much. Had an amazing time. Will deff use again.
