Location, Location, Location!!!!!!! First off the hotel is super clean and the rooms are quite modern. Each room has a microwave and mini fridge.  The location is the best!  There are tons of restaurants and bars around the hotel. You are also within 1-1.5 miles of downtown (which is very walkable) and a few blocks from the river walk.   A cab ride to the airport will cost you around 45 dollars.
