Can't say enough great things about the brewery, the taproom, and the people themselves.  Anybody into beer can tell you the beer scene in Chicago has really taken off, and Half Acre are an amazing contribution to this scene. One of the better brewery tours I have been on, so if you can find space, make it happen.  Growlers to go make a wonderful contribution to any fridge. 162/365
