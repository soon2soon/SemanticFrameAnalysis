What a great find!  For my first day visiting Chicago with a friend we decided to give this a go and what a great choice it was!  Hannah was an awesome tour guide and very knowledgeable.  She was also a great instructor! I was a little nervous having never been on a Segway before but she taught the basics one-on-one and then watched you practice for a bit before starting on our tour. And what a fantastic tour! At least two hours of siteseeing, it was a great introduction to the city. I was able to see a lot of things that I don't think I would have had time to walk to if I was on foot.  They even let you ride up to Soldiers Field. How cool is that?! Hannah was happy to make as many stops as we wanted for photos or questions so I got my fill of photo taking. If you're worried about the riding,  don't be. It turns out to be pretty easy to pick up and an intuitive machine.  Plus almost the whole tour is in no car areas so you won't be worried about straying into traffic.  There are a few pedestrians but when we went there were no giant crowds so it was very simple to maneuver.  Definitely recommend this place!
