Make sure you pick what sightseeing you want to do there are many diff tours. I loved it and it's easy hop on and off the max I waited was 15 mins. I went in Oct so I'm not sure if any other time it's busy. You get a free t shirt, choc, & mini Hershey bar. I really enjoy this tour and recommend it. I did a 3 day tour.
