I found an amazing deal for New Year's Eve - $114 a night.  I thought, how can I pass that up? I had no idea how lucky I was. The service was impeccable.  Every member of the staff was friendly and helpful despite the madness of the holiday.  I was truly impressed.   The rooms were nice (it's five star hotel nice but it beats hands down any other three star chains; eg., Best Western, Holiday Inn, Courtyard, etc.).   I would certainly stay there again - it's right on Rush and Ontario.  It's the perfect location if you need to be downtown.
