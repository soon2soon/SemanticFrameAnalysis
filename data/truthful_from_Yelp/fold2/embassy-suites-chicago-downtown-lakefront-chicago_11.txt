Centrally located and walking distance from shops, restaurants, eataly, the bean, etc. The rooms are clean, modern, and spacious.. The front area is a living room/office space, mini bar & sink. The design is very modern, glass elevator, glass balconies, with an open concept in the middle... However, if you're afraid of heights you might want to stay on the 4th floor!
