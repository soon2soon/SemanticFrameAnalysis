The remodeling of this station turned out fantastic. It's much larger, more efficient and easier to get around. The mosaics . . . maybe I'm biased because my friend, Chicago artist David Csicsko, designed them? No, I am not. While they're not museum-quality, they are fantastic, fun, public art. They make this station . . . dare I say it? A happy place to be. If I Ran the CTA, I'd assign an artist to each stop. The escalators are finally done. I walked thru here last week and saw a guy and his cute son running down the escalator in the opposite direction. They were giggling so much I thought they'd gasp for breath and wet themselves. It cracked me up. Yep. It's the mosaics in this cool station that make you feel whimsical and giddy.Wow, just wait till spring!
