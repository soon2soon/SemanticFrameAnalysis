We stayed here recently while visiting Chicago! It was greeat! The people at ceck in and check out were so kind and helpful. Our room was ready when we arrived a couple of hours early! Everything was nice and clean and they even gave me a little sewing kit bc the button had fallen off a top i had brought .  So definitely recommend this hotel to people who are travelling toChi-town!!   Also, we were always greeted by the front desk employees with a smile! They asked us how our day went, and other small talk. They were very friendly and neat in appearance. The Hotel lobby was clean and had comfortable chairs and a fireplace. Of course we didn't see it on because it is July, but still it looks "homey".  They even let us go to our room as soon as we arrived, which was a few hours earlier than what normal "check in" time is.   When we arrived to our room we were elated to find: a microwave, coffee pot, coffee filters w/ coffee and all of the necessities! There was a small refrigerator and even a good hair dryer!  We did have a good deal on the room and we had to bring an air mattress for our 22yr old daughter, but it worked out just find!  Oh and one more thing...when we wanted breakfast in the morning, the desk employee gave us 2 different names of places where we could get a nice breakfast within walking distance and it turned out great!!
