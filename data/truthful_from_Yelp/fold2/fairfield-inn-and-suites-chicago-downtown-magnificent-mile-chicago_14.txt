We got rooms here on May 4 and 5 off priceline for $43 a night!!!! That's only a few more bucks then a HOSTEL bed. It's a pretty basic place but comfortable and very convenient to a ton of stuff; restaurants, bars, coffee shops, public trans. etc. etc. The staff are very friendly as well. If you can get this off priceline it's a bargain traveler's dream. They have a free breakfast as well. Get to it EARLY because the place gets packed.
