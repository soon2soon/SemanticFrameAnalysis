I'm actually writing an updated review because this company proved without a doubt that customer service is key to their business. An unfortunate series of events (out of my control and the company's) left me with a canceled reservation about a week prior to a special event. Soon thereafter, I received a call to try and set things right, even though my initial reservation was only for a relatively inexpensive BMW 750iL...chump-change compared to some of the high-end exotics they offer. It's great to see this level of customer service, especially considering they hadn't even gotten any of my money. Even though the original issue wasn't by any fault of theirs, they still took responsibility for making me happy. The next time I need to rent something unique, Global Exotic Car Rentals will definitely get my business.
