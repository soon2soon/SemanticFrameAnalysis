I stayed here for a few days during an interview. Every aspect was spectacular. It's such a steal for the location. You're in the heart of downtown, easy access to all types of restaurants across the street, CTA (subway), and landmarks. There was a Hertz down the street, where i rented my car from. I think i only paid $80 something/night from Hotels.com. Free wifi, free printer in lobby, and free breakfast buffet everyday. They had hot items too. Rooms were clean and modern; bed was firm yet airy, perfect for a good night's rest, which was critical for me bc i had 4 back to back interviews, one each day, so a good night's rest was essential to get through the week. Fairfield Inn & Suits definitely helped achieve that on every level. Don't pass this on even if you end up paying a bit more compared to other places, even on Mag mile. Place is worth it! Warning: only valet, no parking lot mainly due to prime location in downtown, i.e. limited space.
