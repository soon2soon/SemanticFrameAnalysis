We booked with a wedding party  and can't say enough good things about the whole experience.  The rooms were nice, large and very clean.  The front desk staff was professional, friendly and accommodating.  The valet service was prompt and courteous.  The pool area was clean and not crowded.  The restaurant has good food with fair prices.  Of course the location is convenient too.  Kari Dawson who is the event coordinator is exceptional and definitely easy to work with.  I would definitely stay here again because we were delighted with our stay.  Also,  I would definitely recommend for wedding parties.
