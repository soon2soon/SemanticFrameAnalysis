This review is for the Great Food Tour, My daughter and I had a blast.I enjoyed the tour guide Jason, he was great at explaining the history of the buildings we walked past. We had so much food and after the second stop, we were full.We literally had to get doggy bags. Jason was so polite, courteous, and funny and the group that we were with was so friendly towards each other.I'm definitely taking that tour again in the near future!
