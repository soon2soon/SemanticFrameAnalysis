Took the Chicago food tour over the weekend. Jason was awesome and gave us a very good history lesson on the 6 places we are at. All the food was really good and by the time we got to sprinkles, I was so full I did not know if I could for in the small cupcake. One thing, the Mexican restaurant, Su Casa, was not very impressive. They told us they were going to take some time to get the tastings ready so we ordered drinks. Drinks got there after the tacos. All in all the choices of the restaurants were really good and we enjoyed it very much. Huge thanks to Jason.
