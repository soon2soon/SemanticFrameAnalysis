I used Elite Chicago Limo this past weekend, Friday-Sunday to take a group of 30 people from Chicago to Electric Daisy Carnival at the Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet. Let me just say, the drivers we had were very nice and extremely accommodating! We were definitely being a bit rowdy since we were going to a music festival and the drivers did not seem to mind at all and let us rage with the music turned up all the way to the fest and back! There were cups, ice and soda provided for us on the bus which was fantastic. The drivers always waited patiently until everyone was able to get back to the bus. No other limo company can compete with the pricing and quality of Elite Chicago Limo. Thank you ECL for helping us have such a great time!
