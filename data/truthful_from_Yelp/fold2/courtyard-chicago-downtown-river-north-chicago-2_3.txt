Great location and extremely friendly staff! From check in to departure the staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was as great as possible. The dining room attendant Javier was especially pleasant during my daily morning breakfast. The room was very spacious and clean with enough room to comfortably sleep 4 people. The bathrooms were nicely updated as well. I certainly recommend staying here if you're looking to visit Chicago's downtown/river north shopping and social district. There are Â of nightlife bars and clubs within walking distance as well.
