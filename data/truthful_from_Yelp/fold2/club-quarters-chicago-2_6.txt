I loved the room we had at the Club Quarters, the location was perfect, just a few minutes away from the subway we took from Midway Airport. Check in was very friendly and quick. Every floor had a station just outside the elevator offering guests free filtered bottled water. I thought this was a great idea, and I always made sure to bring a bottle whenever we went walking around the city. The room we had was nice, the pillows on the bed were a big highlight, they were so comfortable, plus, if you wanted more (and we did) all you needed to do was get more from the guest closet located throughout the floors. In all, I liked this place, would certainly return.
