This is why Half Acre is my favorite brewery in Chicago. For a tour that starts at 11am, there are already 35 people waiting outside at 10am. One hour early. That is dedication! As others have said, for $10, you get a pint glass and 3 pints of beer. PINTS. Not samples, not 12 ounce glasses but pints. 3 beers in 2 hours on a Saturday morning and you my friend have yourself a party. Also important is the tour. It's a small place and you can see the Â love that goes into making the beer. Our tour was given by the founder Gabrielle and he was super cool and very humble. The place can be covered in about 15 minutes (it's 15,000 square feet total including tap room and store) and when you see how they do it (it really is a lot of manual work - not much fancy machinery here!) you will appreciate their beer even more. Chicago has a zillion great beers for sure but Half acre to me in the grandaddy of 'em all. They are currently in the process of opening a 100,000 square foot facility a bit further north and don't know if they're going to give tours there. If they do, sign me up! Bottom line - get there NO later than 10 if you want to guarantee yourself a spot in line.
