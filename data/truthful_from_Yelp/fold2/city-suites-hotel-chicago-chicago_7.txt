My sister and I were in Chicago to visit a relative and we wanted comfort and room, not just a motel, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money. We loved this hotel! The people who worked there were nice, the lobby was pretty, the contin. breakfast was classily laid out with pleasant seating, the rooms were very clean and roomy and comfy, the bathroom adorable, and we just couldn't imagine how anyone could give this hotel an unfavorable review. For the price and location, it is "as good as it gets", hence my 5-star review. It's within a block to good restaurants and the L, it felt safe, and it was central to other parts of the city. That we didn't have to pay a valet every time we needed our car was a big plus, and the garage was a short block away. We both agreed that if we visit Chicago again, with each other or Â our spouses, we're staying here!
