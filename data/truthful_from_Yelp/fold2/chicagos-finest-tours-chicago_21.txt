My mom and I took the history/River walk tour with Brunch last Sunday.  We had a great time!  Rick, our tour guide was fantastic.  He was very knowledgable, funny and very informative.  The brunch was great as well.  The set-up was great, tour, brunch then tour again.  We met great people as well.  I will definitely look for other tours! Highly recommended!  Our group was a nice mix of Chicagoans and out of towners. Really a lot of fun! Molly W.
