My family and I have stayed in various hotels in Chicago and we have never felt more at home than we did staying here. I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman who brought up our bags, but after driving for over 8hrs this guy made my day! He was super nice and friendly. You could tell he loves his job and really likes people. I just can't remember his name but he needs a raise.
