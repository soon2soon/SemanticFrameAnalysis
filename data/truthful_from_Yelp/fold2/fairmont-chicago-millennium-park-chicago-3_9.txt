These folks really know how to spoil you. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for it, but what did you expect? I was there for a convention. Every meal (both convention and personal) in the hotel was delicious. Handicap facilities were clearly marked and didn't run me down any dark corridors or back doors. Staff were attentive and pleasant. The location is great, especially if you love the Art Institute as much as I do. My recommendation is that you go when someone else is paying. That would make it truly perfect.
