Last minute and late night booking because of flight cancellation and of course I booked it for the following night by accident . Got to the hotel and great service by the front desk and switching easily enough my reservation to one evening. I have stayed in numerous hotels in Chicago and the staff here really do make a difference. I had one of the higher floor rooms and noise level was pretty good. This hotel does not suffer as much siren noise as other hotels within the downtown area that I have stayed in. Access to Michigan Ave is quick and easy (out of the hotel take a left basically) plus you are 5 to 10 minutes walk to both the red and blue train lines. Definitely would stay again when back in the Chicagoland area.
