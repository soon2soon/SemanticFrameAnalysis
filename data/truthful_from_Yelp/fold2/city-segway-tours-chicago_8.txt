What a blast! This is a must-do for exploring the city. I'm glad I did this in my first few days here to give me additional ideas of what I wanted to see on my visit here. An excellent deal for $70 + tip for 3 hours and 10 miles of fun! Luke was our awesome tour guide who was so full of interesting historical facts and cool stories, he really made it that much more entertaining. This was my first time on a Segway and being highly uncoordinated, I was a tad nervous, but it's easy provided you follow the instructions on how to be safe. I would do this again here in Chicago or any other city where there is lots to see.
