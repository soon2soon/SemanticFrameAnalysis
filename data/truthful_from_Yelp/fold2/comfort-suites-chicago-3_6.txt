What find this place was! $89 a night, although after the dreary Chicago winter ends, I'm assuming it's more. First off, location. Can't get much better. You are right around the corner from the State and Lake El stop. It is essentially on the River, right downtown. These are basically furnished one bedroom condos. The bedroom had a king bed, the living room had a pull-out couch. Flat screen tvs in each room. There is a full kitchen with a counter, complete with bar stools. In the cupboards, there are cups, wine glasses, silverware, etc. Each individual unit has a washer/dryer. That could totally come in handy if you don't want to pack much clothing or if the damp weather gets your jeans wet while you are in town. There is free Wifi in the rooms, I was on the 8th floor and was able to connect on my iphone. They also serve some type of free breakfast each morning downstairs but that ends at 9 and I never made it downstairs in time. The service at the front desk was great, too. I checked out on Monday at noon and wasn't heading for the airport until five. They were more than happy to store my bags in a locked bellhop closet while I was gone. That was really great and I was able to get around town without my stuff all day. I will totally look into this place next time I'm back in town.
