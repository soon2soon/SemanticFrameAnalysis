OK, I have to give many props to the Fairmont.  I'll start out by qualifying my review with the fact that I'm staying here on the government rate, and I'm being reimbursed.  But I was really happy to pull up and walk into the lobby and see what I saw for the rate we're paying.  It's possible that the regular rate might not seem like as good of  a deal, but I can't imagine that... this place is really nice, and the staff has been fantastic!  I am just two days into my stay, and I normally write a review when I'm done, but I'm just really happy here.  No problems, and every staff member I've encountered is so nice and helpful! Some reviewers have commented on the lack of dining options.  I cannot contradict them.  I'm walking to various local spots to eat.  The in-house ones seem like they will, or should, have a dress code above where I'm willing to be at, and the prices help support that.  The only room service option that's immediately apparent is pizza, and my first night they said it could be almost two hours for a deep dish.  I took a regular pizza and wound up paying about $30 for an OK pie that I only ate two slices of, but that's really on me. Oh, and Wi-Fi is $14 a night over and above the room rate.  Maybe that's because I'm on the government rate, and I really don't care as that's a reimbursable charge anyway.  But I thought I'd mention it. If I wind up in this part of town again, I would definitely stay at the Fairmont again.
