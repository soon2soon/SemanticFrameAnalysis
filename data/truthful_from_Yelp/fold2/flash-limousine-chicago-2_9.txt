We needed a limo to pick us up from the venue after our wedding and take a group back to hotel. The limo got there half an hour early, my husband ran out to make sure the driver knew he was early and that we wouldn't be charged. There didn't seem to be a problem with this. The pricing was great and we were happy with service.
