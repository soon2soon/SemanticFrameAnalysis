Got a stretch limo for my bachelorette party. Driver was very nice. Looked out for us, took pictures of us, helped us with the music, and overall made the experience quite enjoyable. We were probably pretty obnoxious as well so I thank him for that! Called 15+ other places and this was by far the most reasonably priced. Vehicle was clean, stocked, had cool mood lighting. Only suggestion I have is to make it aux cord ready do passengers can choose their own music. Will use again!
