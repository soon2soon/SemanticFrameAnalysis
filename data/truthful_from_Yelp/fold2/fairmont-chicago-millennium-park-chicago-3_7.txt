I don't understand the issues people have had with this hotel. I've stayed here multiple times and have been very satisfied every time. Valet parking was just a little bit extra on my night rate as a package deal and was well-priced. This is the better way to do valet rather than purchasing it separately. The location is quiet and tucked away from downtown but is within short walking distance of Michigan ave and state st and a block away from millennium park. Service is exemplary. The bell hop and valet were very friendly and the front desk staff was very helpful. I asked for some additional toiletries for the second person staying with me and they had them to our room within what seemed like three minutes. I call that fantastic. The room is large and clean and toiletries are up to par for a hotel at this caliber. The hotel is quiet and nicely appointed. I liked the hotel restaurant albeit a bit pricey. I've been very satisfied and have already booked some future stays at this property as I do business in Chicago often. I'm a Fairmont President's Club member and they treat us well. Very very satisfied.
