The staff at Elysian blew me away upon arrival! We got upgraded to a suite and there was a brand new "Preggle" maternity pillow waiting for me on the plush amazing bed. They really do love pregnant people :-) I was beyond excited that they paid so much attention to detail and made our stay absolutely wonderful. When I needed some more shampoo, they brought me a whole tray with 2 of every bath product on it.....and I felt like it was Christmas! My favorite past time was visiting the spa every night and taking a luxurious steam shower as its open late along with the pool. I read that they were just named one of the top hotels by Travel & Leisure and got bought by the Waldorf Astoria. Congrats to them and I have to say.....it doesn't get any better than this!
