This hotel is my most favorite place to stay in Chicago maybe even the country now!  It starts at the front door w TJ or Caesar depending on when you check in,  then you have Christopher who handles your bags as if they are precious cargo, followed by Jessica at the front desk who always makes me feel like I am returning home.  Admittedly the elevators are sluggish but small annoyance for all the amazing service.  Rooms are thoughtfully laid out and the beds and pillows Devine!!! Don't miss out!
