Got picked up fast from the Enterprise bus at the O'Hare Airport, then got helped pretty quick since there were at least 6 workers at the front desk. Pick up a few free waters while you're waiting in line. I got a killer deal for upgrading on a Tahoe for the next 7 days. I'm on vacation, so I might as well splurge!
