My wife and I travel with our three kids to visit my Dad in Chicago multiple times a year.  I also come for business a couple more times.  The best value I have found is the Embassy Suites on North State. The two bed suite is large enough to accommodate all of us plus the separate living area adds a needed level of privacy.  The full hot breakfast is very good and includes a made to order omelette station.  The indoor pool is big enough and shallow enough to keep our youngest (7 year old) occupied.  The staff is always friendly and courteous. The location in River North is convenient to Michigan Avenue to its east and the loop to its south. Most museums and sports venues are a short cab ride away.  There are fancier places for a ton more money and places that may be few dollars cheaper. But if you are looking to see Chicago and want low stress accommodations, this is a place worth considering.
