I liked this place a lot! I enjoyed staying at this hotel! It's in downtown, close by to many transportation stops, close to downtown...this place is a keeper! I thought this place was very nice. It had a small setting or theme going on but I thought it was nice. Like almost everyone else noted, you do get free bottled water at every floor. The staff was polite, nice, accomodating, and helpful. I liked the doorman, he was hustling taxi cabs like no other lol. He was always able to grab a taxi very quickly. We didn't have to wait long and he gave us all of his attention. The rooms are small like the other reviewers said but I thought they were just right. They looked big enough for like a studio apartment. There was a bed, a good size bathroom, desk, microwave, fridge and TV. What else do you need? They work. I'm happy I got a chance to stay at this hotel.
