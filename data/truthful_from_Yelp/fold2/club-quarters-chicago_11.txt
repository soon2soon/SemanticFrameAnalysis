This is the kind of hotel that I love the most: Excellent location Affordable Friendly staff Everything included--I hate super expensive hotels where every single thing costs extra--like wi-fi, I mean honestly. Fridge in room The biggest complaint that I saw in other reviews was the size of the room.  Yes, it's small, but how much time do you spend in your hotel room when on vacation?  It was perfect for the two of us, and we certainly had everything we needed.  The bathroom was a good size, shower was fine, and the mattress was amazing.  Seriously, it may have been partly heat exhaustion, but I slept like a rock all three nights here. Also, the bottled water thing, I was intrigued by this and ended up really liking it.  There's a purified water dispenser in the hall near the elevator, and a rack of empty bottles.  You fill a bottle, and then have bottled water. I was horrified by the notion of them giving away bottled water because I thought it was like Aquafina or something and I know when people encounter free things they tend to over consume, but this was a pretty awesome system.  I grabbed a bottle, which fit well in my purse, and just filled it up several times a day.   Overall, I was very pleased with my stay here, no complaints at all, and I will be seeking out Club Quarters hotels in other cities,
