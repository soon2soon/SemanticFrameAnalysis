I stayed with a couple of colleagues while we were visiting Chicago for a conference. We selected this hotel for a couple of reasons; 1. free wireless, 2. location (close enough to the conference hotel, L station, shopping, etc) 3. price. The hotel exceeded our expectations. The restaurant attached to the hotel was always hopping, though we didn't eat there. We opted for the Corner Bakery a few steps away for our breakfast each morning. The hotel is just a half block off of Michigan Avenue and within walking distance of so many things. Since it was so hot during our visit, we saved quite a bit of money with the free bottled water in the hotel! The hotel staff was pleasant and quick to help. Extra towels arrived to our rooms within minutes of calling. The hotel rooms are small, but the view of the river was fantastic. When you need a clean and safe place to sleep, this fits the bill. Free wifi was very strong and we had no problems connecting, even on the 17th floor. The business center was small, but had a couple of computers and a printer, not crowded, ever. My only complaint is that the sheets were very stiff and harsh. But, all things considered, the other amenities made up for it.
