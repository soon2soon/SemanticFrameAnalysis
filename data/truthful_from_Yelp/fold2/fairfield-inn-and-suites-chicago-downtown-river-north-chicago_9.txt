LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love my Marriott hotels and honestly, they are the only hotel brand that we stay at!  I enjoyed my stay here so much, I booked this hotel two more times in the Spring! Im in love with the location.  Right by Hubbard street for some great restaurants, bars and clubs! All in walking distance, and a short cab ride to other areas. Great customer service and very friendly staff through out the entire hotel.  Our room was very nice and clean.  The breakfast in the morning was your average eggs, sausage, cereals, waffles, fruit, etc...but the staff was just SO nice!!! They made your day...and that bomb coffee..yummo!!! They do have valet parking which is $60 +, but there is garage parking for about $50. Can't wait to come to the city again and enjoy my stay here!
