We had a great experience at this location and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling for a weekend to Chicago! It was our first anniversary and were so pleased that we picked this location. The service was excellent. Extremely friendly, warm and welcoming! They made our anniversary so special. Nothing over the top, but just the sheer fact that thought of us was so thoughtful. Stephanie, what a doll! Also, Megan, Matt and Amber were all there to make our stay wonderful. We received a sweet treat from a local restaurant to split on our anniversary night and cocktail/mocktail along with a special hand signed card. What hotel does that?! So sweet. Matt was kind enough to email us ahead of time to check and see if we had any questions prior to our stay. I don't think there was one thing to complain about - I am a light sleeper so it was a little tough sleeping through the night one night, but there are earplugs and a courteous note by the hotel about the noise. Tip - set the A/C to auto fan and it will run all night and mask the city sounds (cars, sirens, etc.) The bed was very comfortable and the room temperature was very pleasant. The bathroom was very clean and new. Water temp was perfect. Another reviewer mentioned this and I agree - "One of the best things about this property is its near perfect location."  It is located in a great part of the River North area.  It is within walking distance to the elevated train and subway station that will take you all the way to either airport. Tons of restaurants too locally - we seemed to have found ourselves on Wells Street a lot! The price for the value including complementary breakfast at this Fairfield Inn is why we picked it. So glad we did! You won't be disappointed with this place - but you should be prepared if you are a light sleeper about the fire station. It won't affect my choice in staying there if/when we return to Chicago next time.
