Really excellent experience with Echo Limousine. So a group of friends of mine have a tradition of making it down to 3 Floyds Dark Lord Day every April.  One year I drove (terrible idea), one year we had a designated driver (another terrible idea), and last year we took the Reggie's shuttle down (great idea) and hired a car for the way back to Chicago (another great idea). The Reggie's shuttle is great, but our group likes to see all the bands (especially High on Fire), so there is the fear that if we wait for the last shuttle, there might be no room.  And getting stuck in Munster overnight would be a huge buzzkill, no matter how many obscure beers you have been drinking.  So, following last year's plan, we opted for a car service return this year. Enter Echo Limousine.  We made a reservation for a 10 p.m. pickup from 3 Floyds.  We end up tying one on a bit early in the day.  Plus when the sun set, it turned pretty cold and windy, and none of us were prepared (like idiots, we thought the beautiful day time weather would last forever).  And, even though all of us love High on Fire, we are also going to see them in May at the Bottle.  Basically: everyone was ready to leave at 7 p.m. I call the guys at Echo, they say no problem.  The car arrives in 45 minutes, and we ride back home from the greatest beer festival in (warm) luxury. Thank you for your accommodation Echo, we will see you next April.
