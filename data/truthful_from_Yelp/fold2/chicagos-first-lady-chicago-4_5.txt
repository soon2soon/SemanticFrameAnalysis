This was an amazing tour. They are all docent led and they really know what they are talking about our guide clearly loved the city of Chicago where she grew up. She had amazing energy that despite the rain that started to fall was able to motivate part of the tour group to stay on top and see the rest of the buildings. With the architecture you learn the history of Chicago. Bring a warm jacket and a rain coat if there is the chance of rain. Pre order the tickets through the hotel concierge you will save the money of ordering them online.
