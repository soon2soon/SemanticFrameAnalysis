One of the best decisions that I ever made for my wedding was booking Elite Chicago Limo. My wife and I got married in May 2014, and I was put in charge of figuring out transportation from our church to the picture locations and then to the banquet hall. I actually decided on Elite Chicago Limo as opposed to the other vendors because it was one of the few that had a party limo bus available on our wedding day. Including ourselves, we had seventeen people in our wedding party, so we needed something big to transport us all around the city. Our party limo bus arrived on time at our church - we reserved the "Vintage" party limo bus. One of the first things I noticed was how HUGE it was. I've been in a bunch of weddings before, and most of the time, people elect standard limos for transportation, which generally have little leg room and space for people to be seated comfortably in. Thus, I was very pleased with our limo bus, because not only was it spacious enough for all seventeen of us to be comfortable in, but we had a TON of leg room and space to walk around in. My wife's maid of honor was especially excited about the two dance poles in the bus. ;) Our driver was very friendly, and he took us to multiple locations for pictures before finally driving us to Algonquin, IL for our wedding banquet. I was grateful that the AC was good because it was hot that day. I definitely would recommend this company to anyone, especially those with large wedding parties. The representatives are very easy to work with, and they were efficient as well in generating our contract, etc.
