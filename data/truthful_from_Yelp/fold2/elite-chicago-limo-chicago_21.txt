Our friends rented a stretch limo for new years eve 2013. Everything worked out perfectly. Although the weather was bad our driver, Damian, was careful and got us where we needed to go without a problem. The limo was on time, clean and very large. Service and pricing was good. Our driver opened and closed the doors for us at every stop - and there were many. I would recommend using their service if you need a limo.
