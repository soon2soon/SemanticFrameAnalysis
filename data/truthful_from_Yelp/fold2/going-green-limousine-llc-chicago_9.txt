We hired Going Green Limousine to take us around Chicago after our wedding for photos and were very happy with the service. We rented an SUV from 3pm until 5pm(ish). Â Our driver was prompt, polite and very helpful. We had 3 different stops throughout Chicago and the driver waited very patiently as we stopped to take photos. He always found places to park out of the way. He even dropped the photographer off at the starting point, which I thought was going above and beyond. On a side note, I also really like that they use flex-fuel vehicles.
