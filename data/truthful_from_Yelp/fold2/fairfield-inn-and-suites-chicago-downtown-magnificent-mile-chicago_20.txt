The Fairfield is great.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  If you need anything, they want to help you.  I like that the hotel is small and cute.  It's more of a boutique hotel then a chain hotel.  The lobby is beautiful and elegant.  The best part is, it's not too expensive.  You're right off Michigan Ave. and excellent shopping, but you're not really paying the Michigan Ave. price.    This hotel is also a great place for a little escape from  your apartment/condo/flat.  If you want to getaway, but stay in the city, I highly recommend this hotel.
