We had a fantastic experience with this company. We actually called the night before flying into O'Hare and booked them with two car seats in the car ready to go. It was snowy and incredibly cold (the usual for Chicago) but we didn't want to have to take the El or deal with putting car seats into a taxi in that freezing cold weather. This was so convenient because they already had car seats installed so we just loaded the kids into the seats, threw the bags in the bag and went. The price was very good, under $100 which included the car seats and tip. The driver was very friendly and helpful. When traveling with two kids under three it was greatly appreciated. I wholeheartedly recommend them!
