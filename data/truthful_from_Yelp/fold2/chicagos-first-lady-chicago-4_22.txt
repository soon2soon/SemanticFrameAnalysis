Flow reversal of the Chicago River .....a dirigible mooring mast that once accompanied the "onion dome" atop the former Medinah Athletic Club .....a not so common (river) perspective of some of Chicago's great structures .....Chicago's First Lady (Architecture Foundation River Cruise) offers insight along with an unobstructed view of some of Chicago's architectural wonders. The tour lasts a full 90 minutes so bring a hat, a camera and some extra cash for a couple of drinks .....a worthwhile experience for anyone interested in one of America's great cities.
