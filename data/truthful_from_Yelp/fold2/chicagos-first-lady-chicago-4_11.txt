This was an amazing tour and also won me major brownie points with the parents. The docent was very knowledgeable from mid-century architecture to current trends.  Eco Deco, anyone?  As an  architect's daughter, this tour was a no-brainer for their visit.  Even the architect was happily satisfied and did not pipe up about any inaccuracies. It is the pricier of the architecture boat, but well worth the extra cost. We lucky took the tour on a gorgeous day in Chicago.  Our docent had mentioned just a week ago it had been cold and rainy.  He had to hold his mic and umbrella during the downpour.  Now that's dedication. The captain was also great stopping for the cannon at the fountain of the main branch to shoot out for everyone's perfect photo opp. Needless to say, I was extremely satisfied with Chicago' First Lady and couldn't recommend it any higher.
