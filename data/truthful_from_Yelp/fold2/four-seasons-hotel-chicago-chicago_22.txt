I really enjoyed my stay here and am thinking of another trip out to Chicago before it gets cold and snowy. It was truly a relaxing time away without me thinking gosh I need a vacation to recover from the vacation....Location was great and hotel service from check in, and other services were top notch. The workers here are very friendly and kind and I appreciate that. No attitude.  the view was a nice touch..I wasn't in the room much so it didn't matter too much to me.. My one  constructive feedback to Four Seasons is to please buy two ply toilet paper. this bothered my husband a lot.
