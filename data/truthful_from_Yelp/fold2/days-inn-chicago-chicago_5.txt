Super good! Stayed from Thursday 9/18 - Saturday 9/20. Bellmen, valet, and front desk staff were all friendly and professional. The room was small, as others have mentioned, but definitely not as small as I was expecting - 2 people and enough luggage for a 2-day trip, including shopping bags, fit just fine with room to move around. The double bed was also way more comfortable than I was expecting, and plenty roomy for 2 people who are used to sharing a queen bed. No problem at all. Had a courtyard room and was perfectly quiet. Pull-down shade and heavy drapes kept all the light out. Slept great both nights! My husband and I both said how clean the room was. Really good! Shower pressure was a little light but not that bad. Had a couple surges of hot hot water that lasted a second or two, weird, but no big deal. Our Friday night neighbors were a little too loud for our liking so I called the front desk. The guy said 'we'll send security right up' and within 2 minutes everything quieted right down. A/C was fine and just loud enough to act as a white noise machine so we didn't have to use the one I packed because I was worried about the noise. Breakfast was the usual cereals, bagels, donuts etc, and is in a pleasant clean dining area. Valet parking is $26/day with in and out privileges. Self-park is around the corner, $25/day, and no in and out. Went with valet. Thurs and Fri nights, including taxes and 2 days valet, was $341, which I really considered a bargain for Chicago. Trader Joe's and Urban Outfitters are right across the street and plenty of restaurants/bars nearby. Nice area for walking around, felt totally safe. I feel like we really lucked out finding this place and will definitely stay again when we come back to Chicago. It was really just excellent!
