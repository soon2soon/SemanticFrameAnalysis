This was easily the best service I've had at a hotel in a long, long time. Each person at the front desk was friendly without being cloying, and they went out of their way to help me with my credit card issue. On a trip to New York a couple of weeks ago, my corporate AmEx got skimmed, so AmEx was sending me my new card to the hotel in Chicago. The card arrived the day after I did, so I needed to use a personal credit card for authorization for the three nights I would be there. Ordinarily, the authorization is lifted by the credit card company 5-7 business days after checking out -- I learned this from the Sheraton employee -- but it's only 2-3 days from the time of notification if the hotel notifies the credit card company directly, which is what she did. This hotel is one block from Michigan Avenue, and there is a Trader Joe's just around the corner. With the fridge and microwave in my room, I was able to stock up on some basics (fruit, yogurt, mineral water) so I didn't have to stick with restaurant or hotel fare, which other frequent travelers know gets really old really fast. The hotel also has a workout room that actually has windows in it, and the pool area is nice, too. There's a great patio area just outside the workout room and pool, so I was able to get caught up on emails while enjoying some sunshine. I'm definitely going to be frequenting Sheraton properties more now. I'm a bit fed up with Hilton, as Hilton staff fawn all over my diamond status when I check in, but then mess up details like charging for wifi or putting me next to the ice machine. Rachel, the overnight clerk at the Four Points by Sheraton, was amazingly friendly, sweet, and courteous.
