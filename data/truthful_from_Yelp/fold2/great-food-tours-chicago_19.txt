My family and I recently visited Chicago and thought it would be fun to take a Chocolate tour for my husbands birthday.  We had a GREAT time walking around the downtown area and tasting different kinds of chocolates. Our tour guide's name was Seth, and he definetly made the experience more enjoyable.  My husband and children thought he was very entertaining!  We are planning to visit Chicago again in August with a few of our friends, and we will definetly be signing up for another Chocolate tour! Is there a way we can request that Seth be our tour guide?
