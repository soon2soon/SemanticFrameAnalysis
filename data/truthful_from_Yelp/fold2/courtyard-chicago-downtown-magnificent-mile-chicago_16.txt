Great location. Very friendly staff. Front desk staff sent up "treats" for my birthday and a lovely card signed by the front desk staff. Very cool considering that this is my first trip to Chicago. Very happy with this hotel. Being from the south, was very impressed with them making me feel welcome. Clean and nice rooms.
