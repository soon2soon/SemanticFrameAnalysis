I was sitting at my desk listening to "Sunshine in Chicago" by Sun Kil Moon and realized that he stayed in the same hotel that I did during my trip in the fall of 2009. Sitting at the Days Inn hotel, Chicago Room 222 with the ceiling fan low And I just got in the door from Ontario And I'm going on tomorrow This was a fine hotel in a prime location.
