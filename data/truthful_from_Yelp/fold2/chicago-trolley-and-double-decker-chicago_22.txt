My totally awesome good friend and fitness instructor (check out my High Ridge YMCA review!), Dave, gifted my now-husband and I a trolley ride for our crazy fun nuptials at the Willis Tower. The driver was professional and punctual. Pick up was a snap: we boarded at a restaurant near my work in Cicero, IL and made it to the reservation at the Willis Tower early, as planned! He waited for us and when the ceremony was done, we got back on and headed back to the restaurant to eat! I want to give a shout out to the driver, but I didn't catch his name! I'll be sure to update when I get the info! It was a really nice trolley and it was such a great idea to have everyone together as it added a really fun element to the whole evening! Again, THANKS DAVE!!!!
