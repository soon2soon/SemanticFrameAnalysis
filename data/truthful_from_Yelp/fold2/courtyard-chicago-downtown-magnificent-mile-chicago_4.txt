Stayed here two nights for work. The parking is convenient if not pricey but what do you expect from downtown Chicago. The hotel is in the latest courtyard design which features fall themed colors which I really like. The lobby is busy but cozy with a fireplace and a Starbucks adjoining. The on site restaurant is ok, but service was lacking. There is a pool and weight room, laundry on site too. You need your room key to access the elevators which adds an extra measure of security. The facility is amazingly well maintained. I spent my time here during a snow fall and though the streets were slushy and salty, the lobby floor never was. Staff from the valet to the housekeeping was helpful and welcoming. I hope to stay here again in this prime location!
