This hotel is amazing! The night time crew of David and Jose (?) were great with us. My good friend was here on business just as I was about to move out of town and pretty much homeless, so I crashed with her for a few days.   The "room" was  suite that was pretty much a one bedroom condo. Complete with laundry, kitchen, silverware, pots, pans etc....   The night guys took wonderful care of us as we ran in and out of lobby to smoke, ate peanut butter samiches with them, and of course, reminding them to hydrate. Which the went along with, and even would by the end of the week have there water bottles out to show us before we even asked! On the last day I was there even made sure I was up in time for bus (had slept through wake up calls) so I wouldn't miss it. Talk about service, they had been off the clock for 30 min already when that happened. They went above and beyond the whole time we were there, and should get a gold star, or bonus, or something (I really hope the bosses are reading this) for the fantastic customer service they give. Will recommend this hotel to any of my friends visiting Chicago from now on.
