Last November we had our wedding at the 600 N State Street Embassy Suites and Catering & Convention Service Manager Tania Rodriguez was essential to making our wedding incredible. From the initial meeting (Which she recovered from a former employee) to the food tasting, planning and to the day of and day after Tania was with us every single step of the way and helped make everything work out perfectly. Our wedding night was memorable, the guests raved about the food, the drinks, the cake, the hotel... everything went great. I would highly recommend Tania Rodriguez and Embassy Suites!
