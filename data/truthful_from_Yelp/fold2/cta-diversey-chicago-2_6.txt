If you are keen on using city public transportation (I've only been able to compare to hometown SF's Muni and BART, DC's metro, and LA's West LA blue bus), you must try Chicago's El. I've read that the Brown Line is the one to ride around the loop (I believe it is the one featured in movies like While You Were Sleeping and shows like ER) and it's truly a tourist attraction in and of itself. Get a window seat, and you can practically see inside the buildings as your ride along the loop. The CTA/El is safe and reliable. Don't forget to get a day fun pass ($5.75) at local grocery stores if you plan to ride around the city because each trip is $2.75 otherwise.
