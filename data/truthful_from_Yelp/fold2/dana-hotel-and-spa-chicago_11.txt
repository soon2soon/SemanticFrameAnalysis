From the beginning it was a great experience.   The valet was very professional and cheery.  His beard was equally amazing. Inside the space is modern and had a great "I wanna be with the cool kids" vibe. We had dinner tonight hosted by one of our business partners.  Amazing. I'm still thinking about the mashed potatoes and veggies.   Bartenders and waitstaff was on point.  Everything feels like it went seamless,  if their was a hiccup. .. I couldn't tell.  I'll be back tomorrow for a business class hosted by the same company in one of their event rooms.
