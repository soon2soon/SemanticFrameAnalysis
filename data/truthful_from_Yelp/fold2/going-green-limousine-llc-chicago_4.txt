Sorry Angelica, I have over 600 reviews and a photo.  This company is my new go to limo service and I will tell you why. With the previous limo service I frequented, we had a HORRIBLE driver on our last pick up.  Our flight had been delayed, not something we could control, and we had to hear about it and the negative comments about the company the entire trip home. This trip we were in need of a car seat.  Knowing this company provides car seats, I called the previous company and was rudely informed that " no service offers car seats."  To which I responded, "Yeah they do" and hung up. Our drivers were polite, easy to talk to, had the car seat ready for toddler installation, and even apologized that because of the slushy conditions, the car was not clean on the exterior.  Max asked if the route he planned was acceptable to us and then asked if he could park in the driveway, offered everyone water and just made it that much easier coming home from a wonderful vacation.  No phone call to the company was required upon our return.  By the time we got to baggage claim, I had received a text from Max, introducing himself and letting me know to just let him know the exit when we were ready to be picked up. I will use them again and recommend them every opportunity I can.
