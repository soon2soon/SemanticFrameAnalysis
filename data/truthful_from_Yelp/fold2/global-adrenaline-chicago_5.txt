Global Adrenaline planned an amazing trip through Costa Rica.  I was extremely busy leading up to the trip and Global Adrenaline made it simple.  They sent ahead the detailed agenda and had hosts/guides meet us at ever step of the way.   Their planning allowed me to relax and enjoy the trip. If you go, be sure to do the overnight rafting trip on the Pacuare. Amazing food and unbelievable luxury in the middle of a river with no utilities.
