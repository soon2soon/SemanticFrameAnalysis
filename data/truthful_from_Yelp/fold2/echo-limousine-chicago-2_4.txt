I was a little skeptical about this company because I've never used a car company in Chicago.  I live in New York (the taxi, uber, and black car capital of the world) so my expectations are a bit high.  The ride could not have been anymore perfect - Driver was on time (got there about 10 mins early and did not harass me to come out despite his early arrival) - Super courteous from the moment I walked out of my parents house. He actually came up to the door and helped me with my luggage - Temperature inside the car was perfect (not hot or cold) - Car was exceptionally clean - No radio playing - This one is usually a deal-breaker for me:  He didn't try to make stupid small talk with me (I REALLY REALLY hate that) Will definitely continue to use this company on all my future trips to Chicago.
