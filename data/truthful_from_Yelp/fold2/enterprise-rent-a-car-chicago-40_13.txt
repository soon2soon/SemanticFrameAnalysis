By far the best experience I have had with a rental car facility in my life. The staff is very friendly, kind, and generous. I worked with Carly to check-in, and since I had a sprained ankle, she was very slow and patient with me, and helpful to make the experience and smooth as possible. When I told her I would be driving mainly on the highway with the car and was hoping not to receive a "tinker toy" type car, she gave me a free upgrade. She was able to be very personable, and we were laughing the entire time together. When I returned the car, Carly and a few other staff members were present, and were all friendly and attentive. Returning the car was very simple, and when they saw that my ankle was still hurt, the manager got in a car and drove me to work. From now on, I will only be using this facility when I need to rent a car.
