I'm not sure why some Yelp'ers feel the need to give a back story, but here it is briefly.   Ladies at work took the cupcake tour, they loved it and were all like "you should go it was fun" yadda yadda yadda and I was all like sounds like a lot of walking,and... I'm not that into cupcakes. Anyway they then went on the chocolate tour which I was told was longer and more walking.  Again not interested.  Then they decided to go on another tour this one food. So I was sick of being nagged and ummm they had an extra paid ticket so I was like Cool I'm in!! Our tour guide was Jason he was really fun, personable, but not too "look at me. I'm being funny" of a character which sometimes bothers me... Also he was exceptionally tall which helps because I was afraid of being lost in the crowd.    I don't remember were all we went it was some pizza. A hot dog spot. And a cup cake place.  I felt like I was on a cool college field trip for fat people.  And the walking wasn't  all that bad.  And like with most things its the company you keep. My suggestion is to go with people who you know are going to be fun.  Nibble on some food and enjoy the sites, sounds and smells of the tour.   Nuff Said.
