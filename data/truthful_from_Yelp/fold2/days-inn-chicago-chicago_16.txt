This hotel ranks up there with hotels that we have stayed in that are hundreds of dollars more per night. The service was impeccable. The hotel was spotless! The room was spacious with a lovely updated roomy bathroom. The breakfast room was also spotless and spacious. The continental breakfast was plentiful and had a wide selection including fresh fruit and some of the best coffee I have had at a hotel. Although the hotel is located on a busy street in Lincoln Park, the sounds outside were a pleasant backdrop and reminded us that we were in a big city. The neighborhood is safe and vibrant. The desk staff were concerned and kind and very professional.
