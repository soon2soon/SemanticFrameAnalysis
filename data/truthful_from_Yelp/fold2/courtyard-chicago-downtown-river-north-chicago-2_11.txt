This hotel is so nice!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are on the small side, but that's what you have to expect in a downtown hotel.  The rooms are very nice and comfortable and the bed is an absolute dream.   The really great thing about the hotel, besides the location, is the pool, hot tub, sauna, gym, and sun deck facilities.  The pool is pretty big and the hot tub was so nice.  The gym is basic, but they have a good amount of equipment.  The sun deck has a great amount of tables and chairs and a grill.   We had a great time and I'm sure we'll be back.
