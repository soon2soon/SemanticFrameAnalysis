While in town to visit family in March, I made a reservation for one night. After visiting my ailing grandmother in the suburbs, I left my car with the valet and checked in to the hotel around 9:00 pm. Not long after arriving in my room, I got a call that my grandmother had passed away, and I needed to check out, and drive back out to the suburbs to be with my family. I spoke to the front desk staff who told me not to worry, the charge for the room would be refunded and I didn't have to do anything else but go be with my family. I then went to the front entrance to meet my car, and the valet wouldn't take any money from me. I was upset and tired, and the kindness and customer service their staff showed me was so appreciated. I will have to update my review after I get to stay for more than a few minutes, but the staff was extremely kind and helpful, the room was clean and well appointed with a great view, and the location can't be beat. For cold months in Chicago, there is a pedestrian walkway underground that connects to the hotel and can save you from walking outside a bit. Check the hotel's direct website before you book any other way to see if they have any deals in place. I will stay here again without hesitation.
