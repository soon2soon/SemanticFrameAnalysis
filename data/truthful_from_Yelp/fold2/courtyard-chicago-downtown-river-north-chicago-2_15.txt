I thought this was the perfect hotel for seeing Chicago. Not very expensive, and right in the middle of everything. A short walk to most attractions, including the tribune building, millenium park, the river tours, shopping, etc. Right around the corner is the free shuttle to Navy Pier.   Benefits of this hotel - friendly front desk staff, refrigerators in the room, ice machine at every floor, exercise room, pool and spa, outdoor patio (with gas bbq grills) with a great view of trump towers. The rooms were a good size for a big city. I love the free internet access in the room, and wi-fi in the lobby.  They even have a business center and a computer and printer dedicated to printing boarding passes in the lobby. My only complaint is the parking, valet only, at the rate of $45 per night. Park it yourself at the Lakeshore Athletic Club building for $28 per 24 hours.
