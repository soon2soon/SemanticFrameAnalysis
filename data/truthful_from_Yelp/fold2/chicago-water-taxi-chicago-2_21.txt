There's no better way to see the city.   Alright, taking it all in from your own boat--or even better, a friend's boat--might have the edge.  A helicopter would also probably be better.  And once jet packs and hover boards come around for the masses, they'll definitely be better.   So we've established that there are better ways to see the city than by water taxi.  But it's still hard to beat.  Three bucks for what feels like your own personal architecture tour is worth it every time.  The buildings take on a completely different character when viewed from the river, and I'm not nearly good enough of a writer to do the experience justice.  If you're from Chicago, it'll make you glad you live here, and if you're not, you'll wish you did.   If you ever have the opportunity to take the water taxi to work, do so--even if it adds 20 minutes to your commute.  Getting off a boat to go sit at a desk isn't easy, but you'll still be on cloud 9 for the rest of the day.
