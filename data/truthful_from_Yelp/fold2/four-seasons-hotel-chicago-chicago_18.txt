I don't stay in luxury hotels often, but I've stayed at this Four Seasons a few times and I've always left very happy. The rooms are clean, spacious, and have incredible views. Most recently I stayed there the night before and of my wedding, and I was so appreciative of how helpful the staff was. With 10 people getting ready, but makeup/hair/photography teams, there was definitely enough room and plenty of beautiful lighting! We were a bit needy throughout the day asking for bar stools, ice, champagne buckets, help with bags and such, and they were really great. This location is right on Michigan Avenue, and located by a bunch of other good shopping and restaurants (large reason we haven't actually stayed in the hotel to eat), perfect for out of towners.
