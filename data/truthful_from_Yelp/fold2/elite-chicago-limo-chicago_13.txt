Used Elite to rent a party bus for a corporate party from the Loop to Arlington Race Track.  Tina was super helpful coordinating the party.  Tito showed up early for both pick ups, was courteous and super helpful!  The bus was clean, stock with ice and water/soda.  We had a great time and highly recommend Elite!
