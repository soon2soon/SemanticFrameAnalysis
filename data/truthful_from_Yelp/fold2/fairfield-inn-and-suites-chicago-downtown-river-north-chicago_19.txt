I had begun to think that customer service was dead and then I stayed at this hotel.  WOW.  This is the best customer service my family and I have received in years. From the minute we arrived.   From the valet, doorman, front desk. Every single encounter with an employee was such a pleasant experience. If I didn't know better I would have thought I was at a five star hotel.
