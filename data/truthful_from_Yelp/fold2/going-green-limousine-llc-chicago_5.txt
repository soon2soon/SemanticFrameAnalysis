I was contacted by Rebecca (owner) with sincere apologies about our last experience and the promise to look into what happened on our last limo ride. She also offered 50% off our next limo ride. We took advantage of this offer and I'm so glad we did. We had an excellent experience! Our driver was early (which is usually the case). I love that they are waiting on you instead of you waiting on them. The driver was helpful and accommodating. He drove very safely and made some small talk but nothing intrusive which I appreciated being so early in the morning!
