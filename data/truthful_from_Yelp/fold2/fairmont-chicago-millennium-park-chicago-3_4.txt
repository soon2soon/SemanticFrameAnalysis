I was very satisfied with our stay here overnight. The room was clean and everything was crisply tucked in and neatly arranged. Quick and easy check-in, pretty lobby and love some of the old detailing of the building. The bathrooms are huge, our bathroom had a tub and separate stand-up shower. All amenities were provided, including a nice big blow dryer for hair (I hate those little dinky ones). We had a pretty good view too, though we were not in our room that long. At night time, it was nice and quiet, we did not hear anything from the hallway or through the walls, so I would say this hotel is good with soundproofing. If I had one minor criticism it would be that the carpet in the room and in the hallways looked very worn and needed to be updated. This hotel is dog-friendly (for a fee), so if you're looking to bring your pooch, they're welcome at the Fairmont. Great location if you're visiting from out of town, just a block away from Michigan Avenue. I'd highly recommend staying here.
