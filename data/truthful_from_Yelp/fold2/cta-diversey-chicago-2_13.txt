The Brown Line really is my favorite. The trains are cleaner and less crowded than most other CTA trains, they are air-conditioned, and as much as the temporary closures kill me, I know it'll all be worth it when the stations are made prettier. Countdown to a New Brown, indeed! Also, I secretly have a crush on the CTA voice, and I smile every time he says "This. Is. A. Brown. Line. Train. To. Kimball."
