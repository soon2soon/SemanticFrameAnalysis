I rarely give 5 stars for a hotel, as most of the time either a staff is rude, location is not good, wi-fi is expensive, room is not clean or something unpleasant happens. As a well-traveled, recent graduate, I do love traveling within budget without sacrificing on the quality. First of all, this is not your typical Days Inn near the highway exit and gas station. It is a small boutique hotel at a great, great location! I decided to make a quick trip to Chicagoland, but wanted to avoid the expensive and touristy Downtown area hotels. It just feels so artificial and seeing visiting families with their spoiled kids carrying American Girl bags annoy me. Anyways, the lady where I work who is a Chicago native told me that they always tell their friends to stay at the 'Days Inn Lincoln Park' and I kinda raised my eyebrows when she said that, having not really great experiences at other Days Inn hotels. So, overall: - Feels like those small inexpensive, yet practically-chic hotels in non-touristy areas of European cities. - Great location! Very close to L -Diversey station, Jamba Juice (right under the hotel), Borders, Movie Theatres, Walgreens, nice restaurants are all within couple of blocks! Seriously, the location can't be beat. - Great rates! - Free breakfast & free wi-fi! - Very clean and well-kept rooms! - Friendly and professional staff! I mean, for the price I paid, I really couldn't have asked for more! I'm definitely going to stay here whenever I can!
