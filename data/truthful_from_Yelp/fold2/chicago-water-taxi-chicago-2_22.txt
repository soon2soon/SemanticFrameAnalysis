How cool is this?  Avoid the street and take a ride up the river!  Love taking the water taxi to get around downtown, especially if you need to quickly get to Navy Pier.  It makes one or two stops along the way, and there is plenty of seating on board.  I cannot help but getting out my camera phone and snapping a few pictures of the bridges, and buildings, and interesting sites that pass by.  Some of these views you can only get from the river perspective. We've been a few times.  We count it as more than transportation, we include entertainment value in the cost of our ticket.
