I stayed here with my husband while in Chicago this past summer, and it was fantastic! The location was perfect - close to public transportation, shopping, and restaurants. Our favorite spot was Eataly, which was literally a block away. The hotel was very nice on the inside, and our room was nice and spacious for a king sized room. The bathroom had a separate water closet, which made getting ready at night and in the mornings a lot smoother. My only regret is that I didn't get to soak in the gorgeous bathtub! To be honest, though, I wasn't a huge fan of the bathroom amenities. The lotion and soap smelled kind of funny for my tastes. I also appreciated the quiet room in the midst of a loud city. We were never woken up or disturbed. Their turn down service is really unique. You can order certain turn down services, for a fee... but you can get some free ones too! We ordered several aromatherapy pillows! I'm not sure if they helped, but they definitely smelled good. In addition to the nice rooms, they also had a great, full service bar and restaurant. Sometimes hotel restaurant food is so-so, but this food was great, and we were really happy with what we ordered the one time we ate there. They also had several summer programs, and while we were there, we were able to sit on their rooftop deck and watch a movie. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
