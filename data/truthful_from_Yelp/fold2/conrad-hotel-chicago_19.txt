We had a wonderful stay at this hotel.  Not only were the employees professional and courteous, they were genuinely kind and interested in helping to make our trip special.  As part if the chillcation package we had breakfast room service.  More than enough food , right on time and just the right temp.  We had cocktails in the bar before bed (smoothies for my daughters) and hot chocolate throughout the day.  Thank you Abel our bar server.   Loved that we cod leave our coats in the room and shop at nordstrom and visit the spa while the snow piled up outside.  Bathroom amenities were great.  Eataly is one block away.  We had a perfect stay at the conrad.
