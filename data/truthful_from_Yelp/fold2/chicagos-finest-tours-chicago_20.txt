Long time yelp searcher and now my first review. This was hands down one of the most entertaining tours I've been on and by and far I think it was all because of Dan, our awesome tour guide. He definitely loves Chicago and he wants to share it with all his guests. The tour was informative, funny and you get some exercise as well. Wear comfortable shoes and have your game face ready for some trivia! Will definitely try the other tours offered.
