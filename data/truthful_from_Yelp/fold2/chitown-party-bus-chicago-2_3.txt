We had a party of close to 30 people and booked the Big Daddy bus. The bus and the service altogether was freakin awesome! Our group had such a blast on the bus, dancing to our tunes on the loud speakers, cruising all over Chicago, and just having a good time! The process of securing the bus was super simple with quick email and phone replies. The bus arrived early and was very accommodating to take us where we wanted to go. Our driver was very friendly and understood that we were all there to just party. Â I think he had a lot of fun with us as well! I'll definitely be booking with these guys again for future parties, weddings, or work outings! Sold!
