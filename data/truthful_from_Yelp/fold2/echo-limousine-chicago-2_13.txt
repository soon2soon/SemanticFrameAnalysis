Hired Echo Limo for our wedding in September. Our church and venue were just a mile from each other, so I thought it'd be a waste of time/money to hire a car by the hour. They were able to send 2 black SUVs (which were in mint condition) and charge me for point by point trips vs. per hour. The person I worked with on the phone to coordinate was great. Our drivers were friendly, professional, and on time. All around, great experience and outstanding customer service!
