Purchased a Chocolate tour through Groupon for my wife and I and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. The choices of stops for the tour were perfect and provided a nice blend of chocolate samples covering everything from donuts and mini-cupcakes to truffles and gelato. The best part of it all was that there was enough time in between each stop to allow for the group(roughly 12 of us) to not only make purchases along the way, but we were actually able to get a dose of Chicago History during our tour(~2.5 hours). In fact our guide, Seth, did a great job mixing humor with his history lessons and really added to the overall enjoyment of the tour. I myself am one of those who look at a tour guide on something like this as one who could make or break the event and he really hit it out of the park. Not only was he thoroughly knowledgeable about Chicago and its rich history, but he also was very friendly and just seemed very genuine. Couldn't have asked for much more on this tour except maybe a wife who didn't buy chocolate at every stop, but that kind of defeats the purpose, no? Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I would recommend to anyone who loves chocolate or wants to get a better feel for Chicago.
