I thought I would add, after reading several of the reviews, that you should request the 'quiet side' of the building when making reservations. We have stayed on the a West side by the L and it is noisy. The other side of the building is very quiet indeed. Also recommend requesting away from Belmont. It's a busy street late into the night, so it can be noisy as well. Rooms 202, 302 and 402 are great choices.
