Okay, as to my rating it 5 stars: For what it is, a motel in a high density urban area that typically charges $100's of dollars for a place to sleep, you can't beat this location or price with a stick! The rooms have always been clean, I love the little frig inside the room which was amazing when Dominick's grocery was in business across the street, and the FREE parking in this densely populated area is worth the admission price, alone! I lived in Ravenswood for 15 years so I drove past this motel for at least that long of time. When I moved to Michigan and came back in town to visit friends, I tried many motels on the Lincoln Ave. strip. This is the ONLY motel I went back to, over and over again. Staff is friendly, it's located in a super safe neighborhood and I always had a choice of main or top floors. I've recommended many a friend who was traveling through Chicago to stay at the Diplomat and they've all been pleased. With the Western bus just blocks away and the brown line within an easy walk, staying here is a no brainer. Don't be prejudice! People can have "Nooners" at ANY motel/hotel or in the office bathroom! Every time I've stayed here, it's been quiet and clean which is more than I've experienced in motels in resort areas around the nation. I used to pay $50 bucks ten years ago; I don't know what the rate is now, but anything less than $100 bucks is still a steal! If you have a car, you can zip down to the Loop or Mag Mile via Foster to L.S.D.; save your $$$$ to shop the Mag Mile and don't waste it on where you sleep!
