I have four criteria when it comes to hotels:   1. Clean: Check 2. Location: Fantastic. A few blocks from the red line, Trader Joe's downstairs, Michigan avenue shopping 1 block away, and 3 blocks from Portillo's. 3. Friendly staff: They were very accommodating to a few, admittedly annoying, last minute requests (like changing rooms in order to get another bed, checking out early for unrelated reasons, etc.) Thank you! 4. Decent sized fridge for leftovers.   Bonuses: Microwave! Great price! Decent sized room with a tiny couch!   It's clearly not the Ritz, but I'm not hard to please, and I would come back here anytime.
