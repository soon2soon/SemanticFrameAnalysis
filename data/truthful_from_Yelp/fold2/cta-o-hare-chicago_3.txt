What a great option! Public Transportation from O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago. When I got the itinerary for a conference in Chicago, the conference organizers included the options for transportation from O'Hare to our hotel in downtown Chicago. Option 1: Shuttles - $35.00 per person (there's 2 of us) Option 2: Taxi - $50.00 approx (a better option than 1) Option 3: "L" Train - Blue line - $5.00 per person I choose Option 3. Â It was a no brainer. It's easy to get to the the terminal. After getting off the plane, just follow the signs to baggage claim and then follow the signs to the CTA terminal. It's a long walk, but not bad at all. When we got to the terminal, I didn't have a clue what to do next. I asked a transit worker and she was so friendly and nice to give us the 411 on how to buy a ticket and what to do after. Service with a smile, Thank you so much for helping a tired traveler. The train was clean and it was an enjoyable, stress free ride to our hotel. What a great option from airport to our hotel in downtown. I would highly recommend this option to anyone as well.
