A charming, & friendly place to stay is this vintage style hotel, with continental breakfast included. It's got a great locale, with close proximity to yummy eateries, fun live theaters and the train. We couldn't hear that train at all btw (so must have decent soundproof windows). They upgraded our room unexpectedly which was a nice surprise and made for an even more fabulous stay...it was my birthday, and City Suites thoughtfully left a bottle of Champaign on ice and a sweet birthday cake! How cool is that?!! We were very comfortable and happy staying here and plan to book it on future trips downtown.
