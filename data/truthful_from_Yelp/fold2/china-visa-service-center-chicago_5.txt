Needed a visa to go to China and get married again this summer.  Now, I am usually wary of any website having anything to do with China because there are a lot of scammers out there, and I wasn't excited about sending $200+ and my passport to some agency that hadn't been vetted. So, I'm writing this review to let everybody know that China Visa Service Center is A-OKAY.  Price was reasonable (more reasonable than a trip to Chicago and half a day at the consulate anyway), their instructions were clear and easy to follow, and their total turn around time was about a week and a half.  If it's important to you:  I shipped them my passport next day air on a Monday morning, they received it on Tuesday, submitted it on Wednesday with standard service, and I had it in my hands the next Wednesday morning.  Don't know if this is typical, but it worked for me!
