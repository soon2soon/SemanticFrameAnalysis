Another perfect hotel from the Four Seasons.  We had a lovely 1 bedroom suite (upgraded thanks for Amex Fine Hotels program)  This included free (or nearly free) breakfast for each of us each morning. The hotel is located in the high-end shopping district and is even connected to the 900 Shops mall so that in winter you could literally stay inside your entire trip. The restaurant is also amazing.  Breakfast was always awesom.  I had to get the sausage and eggs one day (had 3-4 different varieties) The dinner menu has some interesting items as well (even a hotdog -- fancy -- but still a hotdog) In the reception area they often had free iced team, lemonade or water. Check in and check out were a breeze.   Highly recommended.
