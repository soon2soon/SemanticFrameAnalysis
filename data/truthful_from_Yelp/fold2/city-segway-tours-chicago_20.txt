Chicago is where I rode my first segway, and it was the most enjoyable. Although, I've only tried one other segway tour (Paris), I'd have to say, Chicago was born for the segway. Chicago's scenery on wide and not-so-busy sidewalks make this activity fun. You can go fast, spin, turn, and not lose control and still see the sights. I never knew Chicago had so much to offer until I did their segway. They can't pull this off in NYC. Anyways, their Chicago dog is not too bad either.
