Let me state for the record that I'm not normally a tour person. However, I was in Chicago alone and wanted to learn something instead of wander aimlessly just stumbling on things like I usually do. That's my style and I love it. I took two tours - the Loop and the Millenium Park Tour with Mel and the Riverwalk Architecture at Twilight Tour with Claire. Both were amazing in different ways. Mel was funny and lively and told lots of neat stories. Standing in Death Alley hearing the story of Oriental Theatre was something that I will never forget. I could have wandered by that alley a million times on my own and never would have known. She made the history of Chicago interesting. Claire's tour really gave a neat insight into the architectural history and present of Chicago. I enjoyed both and would take tours with them any time. I enjoyed the emails before and after. It may be pay as you like, but they are worth top dollar. I'll bring back my friends to Free Tours by Food.
