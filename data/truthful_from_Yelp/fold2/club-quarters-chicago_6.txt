Free upgrade to a room with amazing views! We have to walk up some stairs but who cares. Loving it! I was in town for a race and as soon as I walked in the gentleman behind the front desk congratulated me and the house keeper in the elevator was very nice too! Clean room, awesome views, comfortable bed and pillows. Not fancy but we aren't fancy people. Thanks for a wonderful and memorable trip.
