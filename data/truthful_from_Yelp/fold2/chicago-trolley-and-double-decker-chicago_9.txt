We booked Chicago Trolley as our wedding transportation on Oct 2012. Our experience has been so wonderful! We didn't have any problems booking with them. We actually received a coupon for $100 off for a Saturday wedding but they still honored that for my Friday wedding. I'm so glad about that! The bridal party, our family, and our out of town guests were able to fit in 1 trolley (about 25-28 people) and I think they were happy about not having to worry about transportation in Chicago. My only regret is not having a lot of pics of/with/in the trolley.
