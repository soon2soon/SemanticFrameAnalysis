Tiny window, great view, unbeatable price.  I've stayed at Club Quarters on Wacker twice now and it was a great experience both times.  The price on the weekend is unbeatable--even blah little chains in the burbs are more expensive per night.  The hotel is immaculate and sooooo quiet, and the staff is very helpful and kind.  The hotel is within walking distance of several inexpensive eateries (I like the little bistro in the Hotel Monaco) and many of the more expensive places (like McCormick & Schmick)--which you can afford because the room rate isn't mortgage payment level.  The hotel is also within walking distance of public transportation, theaters, the Kriskindlemart (at holiday time).  Parking is also reasonable--$22 for overnight. And who gives a r**'* a** if rooms are small! This isn't the Stateroom Scene, for God's sake! You're in Chicago, people, one of the greatest cities in the world--what good is sitting alone in your room, come hear the music play.
