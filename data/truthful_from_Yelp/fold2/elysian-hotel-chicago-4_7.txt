Heaven in hotel form. Hallelujah! I stayed here for a day in the bridal suite and I didn't have to stay overnight to realize the Elysian is the mecca of modern luxury in the Chi. I mean, l seriously felt like royalty... and a little like a fraud! Ha! Pulling up to the hotel was an experience in itself. It's 9am, I'm in an ugly taxi, flustered and frantic about being late. The taxi pulls in to this secluded atrium and I look up to see gorgeous, up-scale, jaw-dropping-ness. Inside was clean, modern with soft lines and shades of gray and white. The suite? Wow... huge. Let's just say there were 6 bridesmaids, a bride, a stylist, make-up artist and photographers and *no one* felt crowded. Fantastic use of space with modern twists, luxury items breakfast delivered and lunch ready for the bridal party. Oh, and champagne. Did I mention how amazing the bathroom was? Ginormous bathtub for soaking a stressful bride, separated stand-up shower and a toilet room. Let's not forget a TV in a mirror. No--I'm not kidding. You don't even see it until you turn it on! Pimpin', since been pimpin'... I honestly don't know if I'll ever stay in such a posh hotel again in my life, but if you're looking to do it up right in the Chi, this is it. Me? I actually don't even want to know how much it costs to stay there in the suite we were in. I think it would make me pee my pants.
