An excellent value for the money! We stayed in one of the executive/business rooms on the 2nd floor. The linens were completely comfortable, the room was immaculate. Everything you needed was right there. The continental breakfast was fantastic, I'm always a fan of make-your-own waffles. Finally the front desk was so helpful! The person who helped me's name was Casey, it was the by far the BEST customer service I've received at any hotel in my life!!
