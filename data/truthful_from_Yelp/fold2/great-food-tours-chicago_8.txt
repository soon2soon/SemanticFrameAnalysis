Reading the other reviews, I have to say that I imagine the tour guide makes or breaks the experience. We were VERY fortunate to have Seth as our tour guide; he is a local comedian and so his tour delivery was humorous (it was Father's Day weekend, so he had some "dad jokes" too that were pretty funny). He kept us all together and was flexible with group members who had to stay behind with small children, or who joined late because they were part of a bachelorette celebration. When a non-group member came and swiped some cupcakes from our group, Seth made sure that all tour members weren't shorted a cupcake. We did the Groupon deal and met up in front of an office building on State St. - kind of random. Also, I would suggest - regardless of weather, bring a water bottle. I wish we had thought of that before we left, but that would be a good thing for the site to advertise. If it weren't for our tour guide Seth, I probably would have rated this tour a 3 or a 4, but the tour guide is what makes the experience great. Unfortunately, you can't request tour guides or know yours ahead of time, so we lucked out.
