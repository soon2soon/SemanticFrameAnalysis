I was searching for a limo company for awhile. Most have horrible reviews and a lot were for non-responsiveness or being late for airports pickups. I want nothing to do with that. Read up on Going Green and saw all the reviews they have and gave them a try. Let me tell you we couldn't be happier. My fianc√© was traveling alone and I work and was unable to pick her up. Going Green coordinated everything without a hitch. They even called her after she had landed and explained what to do and where they were. We will be using them from now on for airport drop-offs and pickups. I am finally done searching for a reliable company. Thanks guys! Great job
