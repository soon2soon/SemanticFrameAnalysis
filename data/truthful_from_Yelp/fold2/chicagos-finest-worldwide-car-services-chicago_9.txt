Chicago's Finest provided our wedding transportation last weekend. I was extremely impressed with their service from start to finish. From my first phone call with David, to the day of the wedding, this company exceeded every expectation. They also offered more than competing companies for a better price-and much better service. We ordered a 20 person minibus-not an easy thing to navigate through downtown Chicago. Our bus driver was on time, friendly, and able to accommodate all requests made. Although there were many stops and pickups, at no time did this seem to be 'too much' or a problem. I was extremely impressed. I would highly recommend Chicago's Finest based on my experience!
