SUUUUUUPER easy peasy way to get into the heart of Chicago from O'Hare. If you're visiting for a few days, make sure to buy a 3-day (or however many day) unlimited pass from the machines! They are sold on a separate machine from the big one that only doles out single tickets. Â The passes are extremely worth it. There are always trains waiting here everytime I visit Chicago (think this was my 5th or 6th time). The ride does take a while but no complaints!
