A great value for what you pay. The hotel is nice for this price point, and its in a great area -- just off the Magnificent Mile and directly next door to Garrett's popcorn (what's better than that???). The restaurant in the lobby was very good. A delicious brunch. My son threw a fit when we opted not to return for a 2nd day and we had to buy him a waffle a la cart to stop his insanity. (FYI - the Starbucks in the lobby didn't offer the full menu that a large Starbucks does. No breakfast sandwiches, for instance. Just keep that in mind.) The rooms were nice. The staff was very nice and helpful. The gym facility and pool were A-OK. I'd stay there again.
