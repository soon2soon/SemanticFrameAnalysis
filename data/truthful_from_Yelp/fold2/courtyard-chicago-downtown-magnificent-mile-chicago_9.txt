Fantastic hotel and ideal location for a great price! Would definitely recommend to anybody staying near the Magnificent Mile.  It is central and close to anything downtown.  Access to the trains is easy and most things are in walking distance.  They gym is more than adequate for a hotel and the pool as nice and warm. The staff was top notch and willing to help with anything.
