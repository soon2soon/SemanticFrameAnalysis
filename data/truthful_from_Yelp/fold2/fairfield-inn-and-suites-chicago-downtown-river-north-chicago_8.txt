I can't believe I forgot to review this place when I was in Chicago. This review is for July 2013.  It gets 5 stars because it's exactly what it purports itself to be - an incredible value for the economic traveler who doesn't want to compromise. Lobby - clean, bright, felt very safe. Rooms - again, nothing huge or posh yet new, clean, great layout that made the space feel plenty big enough for 2.  Extremely plush pillows and bed that made us buy all new when we came home!  BIG plus is the refrigerator which is a must for me when travelling.  I like to pack some of my own food and keep leftovers from nights out.  No microwave, though. Wifi - reliable throughout the hotel which I can't say for many places! Hot breakfast bar - this was average, just what you would expect.  Nothing wrong with the eggs and other typical american hot items.  Nothing fancy about them, either.  Cold cereals, breads, waffles, etc, all self-serve and included in the stay. Location - first I will say it was across the street from the firehouse.  Yeah, we didn't realize that but I'm a heavy sleeper and it didn't bother me one bit.  My partner?  Okay, maybe not so close to loud alarms next time... HOWEVER, that's where the downfalls end.  I mean, you're smack dab in the center of downtown, just a few blocks from public transport, the Riverwalk, Navy Pier, Michigan Ave...  We walked our little selves from one end of the North neighborhood to the other and back.  Thanks to this hotel we were able to take in an incredible number of tourist sites in just 4 days.   We didn't come for the hotel, we came for the city but we got the best of both with this hotel and great staff.  Thank you!!!
