Let's get something straight here. Any hotel bathroom big enough to hold THREE pack 'n' plays is a FAVORITE with a capital F. We have a 10-month old and we stayed in a nice, lush hotel with a nice, lush king bed just off Michigan Avenue... and we didn't have to whisper because the kiddo slept in the bathroom! Don't hate... only parents really understand. During naps, we could still have lights on! Okay, enough is enough. Here's the rest of the review: Quiet rooms, comfy, large beds, flatscreen televisions, big soaker tub, toilet in another room (yesssss!), fancy soaps and the whole nine. This place has it all. Expensive? Yes. A good night's sleep? Yes. Would I stay there again. YES. YES. YES.
