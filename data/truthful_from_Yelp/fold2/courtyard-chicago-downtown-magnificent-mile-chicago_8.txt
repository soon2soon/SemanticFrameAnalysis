I would give this Courtyard Marriott top ratings on all aspects! The staff was phenomenal.  Probably the friendliest hotel staff I've ever come across.  Always smiling, accommodate every request and just plain helpful to their guests. Loved that there was a Starbucks in the hotel and the bar / hotel / room service was really great.  Delicious food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Room was very nice and very clean.  Nice, new furnishings.  And our group really appreciated the very nice lobby to gather in. Location is perfect.  One block from Michigan Avenue and all it has to offer. And tons of eating and drinking options all around.
