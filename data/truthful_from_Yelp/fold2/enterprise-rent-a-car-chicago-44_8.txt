*belated review* Best rental car experience in my book! With any car rental, efficiency and customer service are so important (people have flights to catch and tend to be...cranky).  At this Enterprise (located inside the Midway airport), everything was quick and easy as it should be.  The staff were all very welcoming and friendly (even at 6:30am on a Saturday). The best part was that the car was upgraded from a standard mid-size SUV (i.e. Ford Escape) to a fully-loaded Jeep Cherokee EX-L!!!  LOVED driving it and definitely took advantage of the heat features on a few cold days.  They did miss cleaning up a few candy wrappers in the cup holders and forgot to clear the GPS history of recent locations from the previous user.  Other than that, the car was presented in pristine condition.  ***Tip: definitely use the pre-installed nav system vs. your own because it received better reception among all the skyscrapers in the city.
