Hired Elite limo for a girls night this past Saturday. I was very pleased! The price is the BEST in the chicagoland area... I know, because I researched +50 limos. You place a deposit and pay the rest the night of. They were amazing from the booking experience to the confirmation. We even paid for a stretch SUV and they sent what seemed to be a party bus. A++++ Limo was clean, driver was fun, nice, helpful, and made sure we had a great time. Based on the price and service.... you cant be Elite Limo. Thanks!
