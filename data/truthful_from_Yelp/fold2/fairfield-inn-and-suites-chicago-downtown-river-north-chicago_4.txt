The staff is very friendly and helpful here. They go out of their way to accommodate anything that you may need or have forgot. The rooms are very clean as well. Parking was a bit expensive, but I guess that is to be expected in Chicago. Yes, it is across the street from a fire station. But I only heard maybe 2-3 trucks leave? Â And it wasn't loud or for that long.
