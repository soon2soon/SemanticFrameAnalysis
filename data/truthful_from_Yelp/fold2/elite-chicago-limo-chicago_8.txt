We scheduled a car to take us to Allstate Arena to see Fleetwood Mac.  The driver picked us up at the requested time, and was super friendly.  The same driver picked us up at the time and spot requested after the concert.  We made a quick exit, avoiding all the traffic and were back in our downtown hotel in no time at all.  Just what we wanted!  After waiting over an hour and a half for a taxi the last time we went to a concert at Allstate Arena, this was amazing.  Tina (who helped me set up my reservation) was very helpful and courteous.  All in all, a terrific experience.
