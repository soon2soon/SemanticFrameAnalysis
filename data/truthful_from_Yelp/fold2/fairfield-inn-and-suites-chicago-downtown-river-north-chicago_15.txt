This hotel opened in June and I think it is a great add to the Marriott portfoliio, especially for a Fairfield. Though it is across from a fire station the location is amazing (I was on a pretty high floor so it wasnt too bad). Â This hotel is close to several bars, great restaurants and TONS of shopping. The staff is great and the rooms are nice with a contemporary touch. Really great value compared to all the other hotels around.
