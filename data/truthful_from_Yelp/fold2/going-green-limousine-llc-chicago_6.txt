After calling around to see what companies have babyseats, I think this is the only one that does;  I don't think any cab companies do. The previous night I called another company with a lot of good Yelp reviews, but with no cars available for the next morning. That morning we had a driver take us to the airport, with the babyseats already installed;  I thought we had to do that ourselves. Robert was pleasant on the way to the airport, and safe. On the way back home from the airport, we hardly waited all that long for our driver to get to us while waiting on the curb;  I think his name was Max. He also had the babyseats installed, which I thought was left up to us to do ourselves.
