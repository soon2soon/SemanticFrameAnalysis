Always had 5-Star service at Enterprise Rent-A-Car locations!  ALWAYS!  Called this location a few weeks ago and spoke with Dan.   What a nice Guy!  Helped me secure a car for our upcoming trip.  And he explained in detail how to take the Blue/Red Lines from the Airport to get to the Enterprise office.  Never seemed rushed nor bothered with my questions.  Had had a similar, outstanding experience with the N. State Street Enterprise location in 2012 (Shout out to Lauren/Jess!!!), but did not know if this location would provide the same quality service.  Well...it did!!! I would never consider any rental car company but ENTERPRISE !  Chicago is a big, big City.  Who would have known you could get "small town service" (friendly, professional) in such a big city?  Also Dan has a great sense of humor:-).  That goes a long way with me. Sadly, I had to call today and cancel our reservation.  Family emergency prevented trip at the last minute.  Will certainly reschedule with Dan, Kyle or Charlie in a few months.  Well Done Guys!
