The Belmont stop is my preferred stop for switching between Brown and Red (and Purple, if I happen to need that one). It's much better than Fullerton simply because there are fewer stops in between. I mean, sure, Diversey is closed right now, so Wellington is the only intermediate stop at the moment, but once the construction is done, you save two unnecessary stops in the Brown/Red transition.
