We stayed 7 nights. We had two connecting rooms given our 3 kids. Excellent staff. Very helpful for directions. Great rooms with a nice indoor pool on 6th floor. Everything within walking distance in downtown and one block from the Michigan shopping mile. If farther like the museums are within an under $10 taxi ride away. The only item was the $57 overnight valet parking but they ended us charging us 5 nights parking instead of 7 nights parking and we did not even ask. I would stay here again.
