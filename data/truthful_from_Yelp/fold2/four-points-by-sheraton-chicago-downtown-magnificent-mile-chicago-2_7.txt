Mrs. B, Baby B, and I stayed at the Four Points Sheraton for two nights during a family vacation in the mid-west. We were very pleased with the hotel and the staff. We didn't have much interaction with the staff (which I feel means the hotel is doing a good job of keeping up their facility), but what interaction we had (check-in, new room key, check-out) was very pleasant and professional. The rooms were very well maintained and cleaned. Mrs. B is very particular about her hotel rooms cleanliness so for her to be this pleased with the room is saying something.
