Ok, so you might thinking a rental car is a rental car. What's the big deal? Well, I was working on a fundraiser for Birch Camp - a summer camp for families affected by AIDS/HIV - and we needed to transport 96 balloons. And that's a helluva lot of balloons. As the proud owner of Pontiac Sunfire, I was looking at making about 10 trips to get all the balloons to the party. With fingers, toes and arms crossed, I called up the closest Enterprise that my company does business with quite often and kindly requested to "borrow" a van for a couple hours. Before I could explain Birch Camp or why we couldn't pay for the vehicle, Colby responded with "Absolutely. Would a cargo van be easier?" So, thank you, Enterprise, for your generosity and enthusiasm in supporting our company and its charities!
