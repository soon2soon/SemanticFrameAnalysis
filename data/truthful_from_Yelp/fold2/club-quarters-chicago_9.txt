I booked a couple rooms here for my friend's birthday and we had a great time! Roman was EXTREMELY helpful and knowledgeable when I called him multiple times with questions. He was very patient with me and made me feel valued as a customer. Tim at the front desk kept my friends and I laughing and was very gracious. This is our second time staying here, and we will definitely be back!
