Needed an inexpensive way to keep my teenage nephew occupied for a few hours. Our tour guide, Mel, had great stories about each site we went to: Chicago Theatre, the Oriental Theatre, Daley Plaza, the Rookery, Rte 66 and Millennium Park. As a Chicago native, I hoped there would be information that I didn't know and there were many great facts about each spot. Overall, the tour was thoughtful and interesting and entertaining. Mel was friendly and outgoing. The pay what you want model was great also. I have been on CAF tours and they are great also but at $35-15, a bit expensive for me right now. I was able to get into a tour the very next day which was key for my weekend needs. Check this tour company out, it's a great way to spend a few hours and learn about Chicago.
