What a wonderful surprise! This hotel reminded me much more of a boutique hotel then a Comfort Suites. It can be sort of misleading by the small lobby but the rooms are HUGE. I could have lived in this hotel room. A great view of the River and the Wrigley building along with a washer and dryer and fully stocked kitchen in the room. I loved that our room was separate from the living space. I can't stress enough how large our room was. The breakfast with the egg omelette'sand bacon was great (especially b/c it was included in the rate!) I would definitely stay here again.
