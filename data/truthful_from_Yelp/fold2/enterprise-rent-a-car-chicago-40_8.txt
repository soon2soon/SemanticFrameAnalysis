Great customer service staff on board at this location.  I made the reservation on priceline about 1 hour before I arrived on location to pick-up the car.  I wanted a small and economical car and they gave me a Fiat! I must have arrived at an 'off' time since I was the only customer there.  When I dropped the car off on a Monday morning, it was packed, but I was still handled quickly. The process was quick and painless and the personal interactions were great.  The Fiat was lots of fun to drive! Thanks guys!
