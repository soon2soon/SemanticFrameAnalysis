Matt Noonan, the manager, deserves TEN stars! Best hotel manager we've ever encountered, from his smiling can-do attitude to making sure every details was to our satisfaction. Hotel is only 1-year old, spotless, well-appointed, and in a perfect location for all the top restaurants and shopping. Will return again and again. Thank you Matt!
