The manager's reception and breakfast are fantastic parts of the stay. I wish the pool had more sound proofing. My only complaint: the hotel elevators. Upon entering the hotel, you need to take the elevator to the "Sky Lobby" (the 5th floor) to check-in. There are three elevators, they're slow and they're crowded. From the Sky Lobby you have to go to a different set of elevators to get to your room (4 elevators - very fast). In general, the whole experience is amazing!
