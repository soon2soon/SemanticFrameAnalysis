The Belmont stop is kind of like my garage, since I don't drive, so of course I love it.  And it's an integral part of the neighborhood.  I love that it's in the middle of a lot of activity.  Many places in Chicago, you have to choose whether you want to live closer to the train, or closer to the commercial activity -- but at Belmont it's in the same place, which is the way it should be.
