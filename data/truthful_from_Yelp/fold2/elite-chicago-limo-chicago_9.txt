I was super impressed with my entire experience with Elite Chicago Limo.  I rented a 10 person limo for my friend's bacherlorette party.  The booking was done all online including updating the route and paying which was very convenient.  The driver appeared right on time, and Paul our driver was awesome.  The limo itself was really nice.  I would definitely use this company again and had an incredible time!
