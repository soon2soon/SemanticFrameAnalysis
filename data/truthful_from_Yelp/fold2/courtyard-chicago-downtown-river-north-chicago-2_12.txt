This hotel was great! I can't explain how refreshing it is to be met by super friendly, happy, knowledgeable staff every time I pass through the lobby. They actually want to help! Â (Michelle at the front desk- top notch!) The hotel is updated and modern. Location is great- walking distance to almost everything, and when I didn't want to walk in the cold, the doormen were able to get cabs quickly. I'll definitely stay here again!
