I stayed here about a week ago for St. Patty's Day. We originally choose this hotel because Embassy Suites are always nice and for the location. I was very impressed. Local transportation was amazing, right around the corner from the subway. It was near many restaurants and definitely within walking distance of that excellent Chicago shopping. When we checked in the front desk was very accommodating, making all of our requests possible. We had a suite and it was a nice view of the city. I would definitely stay here again!!! I strongly recommend the Embassy Suite hotel chain to everyone!
