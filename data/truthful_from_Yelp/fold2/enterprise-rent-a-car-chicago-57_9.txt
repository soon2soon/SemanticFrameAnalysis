After a few instances of getting mediocre service, I was going to give Enterprise one more chance before using National and paying extra for a nice car rental. Dealt with a lady named Tamara and she was exceedingly amazing with her service and personality. I'll be back only in part of hoping she will be back next month. Got a nice GMC SUV too!
