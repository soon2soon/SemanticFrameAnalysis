We used Elite Chicago Limo for our wedding in June and had a fantastic experience.  Not only were they incredibly affordable, but the limos were really nice inside and stocked with plenty of alcohol, all 3 drivers arrived right on time, were very friendly and courteous, and made it so fun to drive around the city in a limo!  I will use Elite Chicago again and highly recommend them.
