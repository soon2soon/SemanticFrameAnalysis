So where to start? Well what caught my attention was the attentive welcoming to the offering of "have a cold bottle of water" from being on a long trip was a refreshing experience getting into Chicago. I've had a skeptical view about car rental companies and with Enterprise (Chicago) has changed all that. Scott our representative gave us the red carpet treatment and really had us surprised. I will be using them again for future rentals.
