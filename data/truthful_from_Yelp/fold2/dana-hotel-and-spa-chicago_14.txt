If I could give this hotel two more stars I would.  The service was GREAT!! Room 1314 had a nice feel to it as well as a great view of the city.  My husband and I really needed to kick back and relax. After dinner and a few drinks we were exhausted.  We thougt the bed and pillows would be the standard hotel feel.  Nope not at all, pillows were so fluffy and the bed was extremely comfortable. Our day of check out for whatever reason there was no hot water for our shower. We called the front desk and the representative Stephanie handled the situation appropriately. I would definitely stay at the hotel again.
