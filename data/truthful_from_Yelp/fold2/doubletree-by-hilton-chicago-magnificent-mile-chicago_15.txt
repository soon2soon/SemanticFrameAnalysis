Hands down one of my favorite hotels in Chicago. My husband and I come tonChicago every weekend and we always jump at the chance to stay here. What's not to love? Let me start with the best features: 1) location- amazing! Right on Fairbanks, right by the river. A close distance to both navy pier and the mag mile? What more can you ask for? 2) warm chocolate chip cookie at check-in is really the icing on the cake for a great hotel like this. It makes a huge difference though when you're checking in at midnight! 3) amazing room- check! Super comfy beds, big bathroom, great toiletries. Bonus, it's connected to Einstein's and down the street for Dominick's for an early Starbucks run if needed. A definite must stay for business or fun!
