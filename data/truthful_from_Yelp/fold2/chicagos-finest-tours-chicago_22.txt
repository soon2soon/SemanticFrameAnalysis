Being a native Chicagoan, I thought that I knew my home town pretty well. My husband and joined this tour and got to see a side of the city that most do not even know exists. The Chicago Pedway and Loop Architecture tour is one of several Pedway tours conducted by Chicago's Finest Tours chicagosfinesttours.com What is the Pedway? It is the series of underground walkways in downtown Chicago. We had a wonderful tour guide, Sharon, who seemed to enjoy the tour as much as we did. She told some great stories about the city that we had not known. We, in turn, sang her a song about the Chicago Fire and Mrs. O'Leary's cow that she had not known, though a bit off key. This tour is not for the faint of heart or the extremely weak of knees, as there is a bit of brisk walking (about 1 1/2 miles) and quite a few stairs to navigate. Loved the little prize at one of the shops and the trivia quiz. Overall, this is a great tour for visitors as well as seasoned Chicago residents. Looking forward to some the other tours from this company.
