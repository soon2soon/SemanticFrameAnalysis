Location, Luxury, and Outstanding Service; Best in Chicago!! Living the suburbs, it's not uncommon for the family to spend the weekend in the city. When arriving, I was greeted as HH Diamond Member and directly upgraded to a suite with a view of Michigan Avenue. Everyone my family interacted with at the Conrad was pleasant and welcoming. Parking was a breeze (selfpark directly across the street) and at $45 for 24 hours, fairly cheap by Chicago standards. You also get in-and-out privileges. Our room was immaculate, wonderful amenities throughout. The room was extremely private and quiet allowing for a good night's sleep. The lobby bar is nice and the rooftop is a great place for a quick cocktail. I highly recommend the Conrad Hotel to anyone looking for nothing but the best in everything a quality hotel is supposed to deliver, and then some.
