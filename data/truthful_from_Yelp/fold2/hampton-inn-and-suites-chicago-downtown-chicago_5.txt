Loved this hotel during our recent Chicago trip! After scoping all of the travel sites, we ended up deciding to go with the Hampton Inn and Suites during our vacation.  A couple of factors that played into our decision were location, price, and size.  I think we ended up paying about $160/night and we got a king suite--a bedroom with a king bed and a separate living room/kitchenette area with a sofa bed.  This came in handy since we had 4 people on our trip and we needed a place to hang with our other friends (locals). The room was always clean and nice.  Service was impeccable and their free breakfast  was pretty darn awesome.  I will definitely stay here again!
