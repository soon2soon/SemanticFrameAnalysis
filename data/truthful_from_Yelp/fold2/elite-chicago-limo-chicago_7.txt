I booked Elite to drive my daughter around in class for her first homecoming, and they did not disappoint! They were on time, polite, and the ride was very stylish. I was very important that my daughter have a good time on her first dance, and they made it a night to remember. Thank you for bringing my daughter home safely, and I look forward to using your services again!
