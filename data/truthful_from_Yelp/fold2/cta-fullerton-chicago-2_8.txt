Please, CTA, please install these "train tracker" signs on all other stores whenever you get the money to do it. I don't know what DePaul did to get them, but we'd all appreciate them, perhaps especially so when we have to wait for the L on interstates (which I do regularly) and that kind of thing. Also, don't make it an ad-filled plasma screen like the one at 47th. Okay, now I'm just kidding myself.
