Went on a spontaneous tour ride with my boyfriend after lunch! We had a great time - learned some new things about Chicago! You will be surprised at how much you didn't know about the city even if you were born and raised here. Bring a blanket along because the tour passes the lake and it can get pretty chilly on windy days
