My husband and I got in on a Sunday afternoon after our wedding week and were simply exhausted. Right before we had left Chicago earlier in the week, our car had broken down. Thus we had to rent a car. I've always used enterprise in the past and they have been excellent, and this time was no exception. Every single one of the people I spoke with were super nice. Matt M. helped us up at the front, and he was a friggin' treasure. After his initial quote my husband and I were discussing our dilemma and what we could really afford. He said they had only had standard size cars listed as available in the computer, but then he asked if we could wait a second while he called up to the guys in the garage and found us a smaller car for cheaper. He told them to hold it for us, and then booked it all in the system. Then he told us several different circumstances and the prices, in case we changed our minds. We ended up saving some much-needed money because of Matt, and I will definitely continue to use Enterprise because of it. The guys in the garage were just as helpful and sweet, and they had us on the road very shortly. When I came back to drop the car off the guy was very nice and helpful even though he had about 15 people turning in their cars at once. I was very impressed all around.
