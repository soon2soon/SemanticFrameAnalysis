Definitely the most well-maintained of the L lines -- with the station upgrades completed, like the one at my home Diversey stop, they're almost all in good shape.  The purple line express at rush hour is a useful addition, and there might be some slowdown in the winter, but even then I give props to the CTA for the rarity of late brown-line trains. And for shallow enjoyment, the brown line is also notable for very high levels of passenger hotness, thanks to its run near the young / social-heavy neighborhoods.  It's a much better visual part of the workday than spreadsheets and PowerPoints.
