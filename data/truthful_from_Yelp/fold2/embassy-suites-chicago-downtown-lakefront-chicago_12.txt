We sat around trying to see if there was any reason we shouldn't give the Embassy Suites Downtown five stars, and lo and behold, we could find no reason whatsoever. Staff:  friendly and helpful. Rooms:  clean, comfortable and very spacious, with living room and bedroom areas, complete with wetbar, fridge, and microwave.  Flat screen tvs in both rooms! Location: convenient to the nth power.  (Near train, near taxis, near Trader Joe's and Jewel Osco groceries, near restaurants, near Bloomingdales and near the only Cathedral in Chicago. Iconic attractions just minutes away. Rates:  reasonable considering the market place and the amenities. Complimentary breakfast:  fantastic!   Lobby store:  small, but excellent offerings. When I come back to Chicago, this is the only place for me.
