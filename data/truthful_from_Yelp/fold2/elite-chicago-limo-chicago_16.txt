Quick, professional, easy to reach, and has the best limo prices in Chicago! I did hours upon hours of calling, getting quotes from, and looking at the websites of what I feel like was every last limo company in Chicago, and Elite's prices were by far the least expensive. My contact, Aidas, was extremely accommodating when we had to cancel a week before due to unforeseen circumstances, so much so that we booked again with them when we rescheduled our event. Our driver arrived early, was courteous, and even put up with some of our really, really late night shenanigans. I will definitely be using Elite for limo transportation next time in Chicago!
