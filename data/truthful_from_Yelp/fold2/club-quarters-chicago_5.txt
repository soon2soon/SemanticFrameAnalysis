Perfect location and staff is great! For tourists, it's close to shopping on MIchigan Ave. For business people that need to be in the Loop or Merchandise Mart, it's all walking distance. 7-11 and Walgreens within a block. All major River/Architectural tour boats are 1-2 blocks away. The hotel has free wifi, self serve bottled water. Free coffee machine and snacks on the 2nd floor. When I went to use the coffee machine, it needed to be emptied so I told guy at front desk. Rather than picking up the phone and calling housekeeping or engineering, he came up with me to empty it...very responsive thanks!
