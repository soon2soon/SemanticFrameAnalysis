I never write reviews but felt compelled to for this Enterprise location because they have impressed me with their customer service time and time again. The staff is always incredibly friendly & accommodating and they make the pickup/drop off process quick and painless. There are also never any mysterious surprise charges on my bill like I have seen with other car rental companies. Rayne in particular surpassed my expectations in customer service when I needed a car in an emergency and there were none left since it was the end of the day and I did not have a reservation. She made several phone calls and was persistent until finally they agreed to have one driven in from another location for me. I don't know what I would have done that day if it weren't for her. Thanks guys!!!
