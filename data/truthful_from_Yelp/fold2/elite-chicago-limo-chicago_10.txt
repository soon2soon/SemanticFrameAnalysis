I was very worried about renting a limo with all the mixed reviews online. I searched for two weeks and came up with elite Chicago limo. It was one of the greatest experiences regarding customer service, fit and finish, and quality for price. It was a pickup and dropoff for my father's 60th birthday. The price that was quoted was the price I paid and the tip was included. The driver was Pawel and he was exceptional. We even gave him another tip because of the great customer service he provided. Overall I would use them again in a heart beat.
