We booked the 15-passenger bus for a bachelorette party in Chicago last weekend and had a great experience. Our driver, Alex, showed up about 30 minutes early, which was nice, and was so personable and a ton of fun. The limo was perfect size for our group (the Mercedes bus doesn't have as much room to walk around as the traditional party bus, but had plenty of space for our group of 13), in excellent condition, and our entire night's schedule/route went completely according to plan. Great service, easy to book and quick to respond to any questions we had - I'd recommend to others and will keep in mind for future events of my own.
