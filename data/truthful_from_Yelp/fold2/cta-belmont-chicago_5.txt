The Red Line was my favorite line of all of the lines available in Chicago.  It's basically running all night long.  It takes me North and South, but be careful, don't go past Sox after 2 am... The place we were staying at was minutes from this stop and it was able to take you anywhere in town. LOVE IT!  Why are the stupid trains in Houston the ground?!
