Best hotel I have ever stayed at in Chicago! My family and I made a very last minute trip to Chicago for a day/night. We booked our hotel at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Chicago Downtown because it was much less than any other hotel around (by at least $250!) The location is perfect! In walking distance to the magnificent mile, Navy Pier and Giordanos (yum!) The staff was excellent! Very friendly, knowledgable and helpful! As was the valet guys. When we went to check in the first desk girl asked if we wanted maps and brochures. She also informed of us free wifi (with no password!), 24/7 coffee and hot chocolate and the scrumptious breakfast that is served the next morning. The same lady was also there when we checked out and asked how our stay was and if we had any concerns. I wish I knew her name because she deserves an award for Employee of the Year! Just to warn you, if you are a light sleeper a lot of ambulances and police cars are loud at night. I was told the higher up you are the quieter it is. I stayed on level 8 and it was still pretty loud but I am used to loud noises. The breakfast was deluxe continental. It included: eggs, waffles, donuts, bagels, fresh fruit, english muffins, sausage and fresh juices. Delicious and very filling! The breakfast room has smaller tables but more guests can fit in there that way. The breakfast staff always made sure everything was stocked and checked on everyones meals. My family of three grown women stayed in a two double bed room. I've read a lot of people thought the rooms were small. I usually feel closterphobic and didn't have any issues. The room was average size. The only real issue I had with the room was their was no fridge and the sink was in the bathroom. Took longer for us ladies to get ready. I plan on returning to Chicago next summer and can't wait to stay here again!
