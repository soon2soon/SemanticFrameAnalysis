Hey, it's public transportation so you have to put up with certain things but I've been on all the lines in Chicago and trains in DC, NYC, Atlanta and LA.  The brown line measures up nicely.  Mostly cool people who are courteous, polite, and will even vacate their seat for a pregnant woman or a person on crutches.  It's usually clean and has decent air conditioning in the summer.  I much prefer it to driving to and from the loop.
