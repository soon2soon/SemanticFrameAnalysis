Go to the brewery tour! Luckily I was with someone who had been on the tour before, so he knew the drill. Tour starts at 11 every Saturday, and first 60 people in line get in. People start lining up early so I suggest you get there by like 10:15 to ensure your spot. Around 10:30 they'll start passing out the "golden tickets" which is your entry in. For $10 you get a tour with a pint glass and 3 fills of beer. The tour was very informative and fun, and there were frequent breaks to refill your cup. All the beer here was really good, and I even bought some so take home with me. There's a gift shop and taproom connected to the brewery, so if you didn't get your fill on the tour, you can get more beer at either of these places.
