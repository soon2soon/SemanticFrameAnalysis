Go see Brian, he'll fix you right up. Very friendly and got me in and out in under 15 minutes. The prices are about right, but great with the weekend 50% off deal, and he offered to upgrade my auto to fit my gigantor self for only a few more bucks per day. Next time I rent, I'm going back to this Enterprise location, which is easy to get to (walkable from the Logan and Belmont blue lines or Diversey bus) and simple to get in and out of - unlike the one on Milwaukee in Bucktown.
