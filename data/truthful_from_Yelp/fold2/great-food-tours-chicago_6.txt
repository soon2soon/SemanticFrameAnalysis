We found a Groupon for the cupcake tour and four of us from work signed up. We looked forward to it for weeks. Our guide was Jason and he was funny and knowledgeable about the bakeries and the surrounding area. It's a walking tour so dress comfortably but we felt better walking in between stuffing our faces. Even as locals we realized we had never been to many of the stops. The gelato stop was a nice surprise and a refreshing break from the decadent cupcakes. By all means, try the BLT cupcake from More Cupcakes!
