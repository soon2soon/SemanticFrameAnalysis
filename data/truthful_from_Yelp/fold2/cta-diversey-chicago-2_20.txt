I love the entire brown line!  It's being re-vamped right now so I haven't really been on it lately, BUT it was my public transportation for the 4 years I was in high school.  It's close to my house, I can get down town pretty easily, it stops at Belmont and Fullerton so picking up the red line is easy.  I can also use it to pick up the purple line to go to evanston.  It works like a charm.  It's a lot less crowded than the red line also.
