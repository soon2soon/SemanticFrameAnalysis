I have used this Enterprise on several occasions.  They are always nice and greet me when I come in.  Even if there is a person or two a head of me, it has never taken more than 15-20 minutes to get in and out.  When I return the car, they will drive me to the blue line.  Very happy with their service and will continue to rent from them.
