Costa Rica Experts is the ONLY way to go if you're planning a trip to Costa Rica.  My husband and I typically plan our trips on our own but  we used Costa Rica Experts at the recommendation of a friend.  They are outstanding resources.  You can look at some possible itineraries on their website and then work with one of their people to customize it based on your budget and desires.   The accommodations they booked were great, the local drivers prompt and courteous, and the excursions very informative and fun.  Costa Rica Experts truly do know their stuff! While you're in Costa Rica, if any question or issue surfaces, you can contact an on-the-ground organization connected with Costa Rica Experts  to assist you.   We highly recommend Costa Rica Experts for your travel to this amazing country!
