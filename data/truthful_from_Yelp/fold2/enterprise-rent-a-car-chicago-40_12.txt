Let me start by saying that I never thought I would write a review about Enterprise - much less a positive one - but this experience is worth documenting.   Upon picking up the car the team was friendly and professional from the moment I walked in.  When I requested an upgrade at a Chevy Malibu (I know, I'm a bit of a dork for liking this vehicle...) they actually accommodated my request a smile!  (What a refreshing surprise!)   The thing that really blew me away about my experience is a bit embarrassing.  The City of Chicago towed the car while I had it parked on the street (don't get me started), and Tim was great about assisting me the appropriate documentation to pick up the vehicle from the impound.  Further, since I called right away when it happened Tim offered me a bit of a grace period on getting the vehicle back to their office.  They had the opportunity to rightfully charge me a late fee, and they went above & beyond with me by NOT nickel & diming me.  Tim & the 10 E. Grand location are definitely a class act.  I will be renting from them again any time I need a vehicle.   THANK YOU, Enterprise, for treating me a small, locally owned business rather a huge corporate conglomerate.  :-)
