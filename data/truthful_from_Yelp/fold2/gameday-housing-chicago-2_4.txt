I have been a member at gameday since 2009, renting out my home for PSU games. I have had excellent service and results each season.   The staff is extremely responsive and helpful in a pinch.  I have received help from them during bad situations in even worse hours - one time a guest of mine was locked out of my home at 1 am on a Sunday and couldn't reach me on the cell phone.  Wes took their call and helped them find my spare key. I highly recommend gameday to other owners. Top notch.
