Went on the Twighlight Riverfront tour with Claire yesterday. The tour was awesome!!! As soon as we arrived she introduced herself and asked where we were from. We met at the Chicago Theatre, where the tour kicked off. We covered Merchandise Mart, the Marina buildings, the waterfront/ Vietnam memorial, Trump building,  Wrigley building, Jeweler building, Tribune building, and a few more I am forgetting to mention. Claire had some great knowledge on the history of these buildings, the riverfront, and just the city in general. She pointed out so many fun facts that I would have never known wandering around the city by myself. She was extremely professional and a lot of fun to listen to. I felt like she was a friend showing us around the city. She kept a great pace, and allowed plenty of time to snap some photos along the way. You can tell she was passionate about history, architecture, Chicago, & her job as a tour guide for FTbF. She left us off at the centennial fountain just in time for us to watch it go off :-) At the end of the tour, she made sure folks were able to get back to the train or made suggestions for the rest of the evening - like heading over to Navy Pier to watch the summer Saturday night fireworks go off. She helped recommend a place for us to eat, too.  I almost want to take away a star because I wish it was longer than 2 hours (not because it was short, but I literally didn't want it to end! It was so much fun!!) Very happy with the tour and the idea of a 'pay what you wish' attraction. My friend took the Philadelphia tour by the same company and said it was equally as awesome. Highly recommended. . Being new to the city, I will probably take them all (eventually).  Thanks Claire!!!!!
