33 years as a Chicago-area resident and I've NEVER been on a water taxi until yesterday?!  For shame!  When my +1 suggested it, I know I squealed like a little girl at a One Direction concert.   Don't judge me. We took the taxi to Chinatown.  It was $4 for one way, or $8 for an all-day pass.  We got the latter (= same cost round-trip, or we could ride the taxi back and forth all day, which I was also not opposed to).   There were some nice sights I'd never seen before.  Call me a weirdo, but I love old run-down architecture.  It also offered a beautiful view of the city.  Stopping at Ping Tom Memorial Park was also neat, as I'd never been to that side of Chinatown! Definitely a great and inexpensive way to see a bit of Chicago - just don't wait 33 years to do it! :)
