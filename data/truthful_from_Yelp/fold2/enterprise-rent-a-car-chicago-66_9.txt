This is Part II and Part III of my Yelp review of the 850 N. State Street Enterprise Car Rental Business(see Part 1 9/25/12): Part II:  Excellent, Five "big" Stars.....Lauren and Jess have it together Big Time!  They are wonder women and can do it all.  My husband and I arrirved to pick up our car and found Lauren in the Office with our car all ready!  She was helping someone at the Desk who had just returned a car, answering the phone and smiling at us as we walked in the door.  Never missing a beat or even seeming rushed.  She is awesome. She patiently answered all our questions and we were on our way in no time. Part III:  Bring car in a week later.  Who is there to greet us.  Lauren and Jess!  Again, incredible customer service.  Lauren called us a cab even though I said I would so we could head out to the airport.  These two "super" women rock.  We are going to miss seeing them.  But, next year when we come out to Chicago there is no doubt who we will be calling to rent a car!!! Thanks Lauren and Jess for everything!!!
