Using the tips on here, I reserved the queen business room and I am so happy I did! I cannot imagine the size of the other rooms. Because even this was small, but cozy! Gorgeous bathroom, comfortable bed, and right by the courtyard so noise was never an issue (we had room 435). Very clean! Nice and polite staff. Breakfast was the best we had seen all trip with a great sized space. You can either park yourself behind the building in the parking ramp or pay one more dollar and do valet, which is so much more convenient. And my car was kept safe! Overall, very impressed and happy with my stay!
