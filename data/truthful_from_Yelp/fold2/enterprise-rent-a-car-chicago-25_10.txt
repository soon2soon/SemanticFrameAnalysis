I called the other day because I was looking for a very specific car to rent for a photo shoot.  I talked to an agent named Dan who bent over backwards to get exactly what I needed.  He promised me that he would have the car delivered by the end of day and he came through!  He was also courteous enough to keep calling to tell me the progress of the search.  He surpassed my expectations and truly deserves a big pat n the back for his AMAZING customer service.
