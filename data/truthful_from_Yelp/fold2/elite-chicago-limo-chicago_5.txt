I had the pleasure of spending a Saturday night out on one of Elite Chicago Limo's party buses, and I had a fantastic time with my friends! The driver was very nice and accommodating, and the bus was extremely clean and had great features! We used the bus Legacy, which I was told was the newest in the fleet. It was absolutely beautiful (real tile flooring inside!), not to mention comfortable. Elite definitely pays attention to detail. Highly recommended! Great service!
