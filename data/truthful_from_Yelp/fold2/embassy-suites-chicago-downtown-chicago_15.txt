They seem to have fixed the slow elevator problem. They arrived instantly each time. The hotel rooms are very clean and tastefully decorated. Even the pullout mattress and pad were spotless and new. This is always a treat. Sofa and chairs also seemed quite new. I appreciate that Iwater wasn't up to my ankles in the shower, Â however, it could use a little better shower head. Staff was very efficient and courteous. The only drawback was the free breakfast. You wait in quite a long line only to scoop out watery eggs and cold everything else. If you happen to have the time and patience to wait in the order your own omelet line you will get hot tasty eggs. The lone chef who cooks the omelets is an attraction to watch while you are waiting. His speed and efficiency are amazing. I hope they pay him well. I strongly advise getting down to breakfast as early as possible. I would definitely consider staying there again and recommending it to others. Lots of excellent restaurants in the general vicinity.
