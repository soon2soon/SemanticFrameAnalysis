I stayed here for the first time this week. I normally stay at the State Street Embassy when downtown, but this was close to my meeting location. This Embassy earns five stars for several reasons: - Very friendly welcome at check-in, and the desk clerk pronounced my name correctly - The hotel offers a very sleek, clean and modern decor that is superbly maintained - My guest room was immaculately clean, nicely appointed, and very comfortable - The cook-to-order breakfast yielded one of the best omelets I've had in a long time - Great location within an easy walk of several great restaurants Sorry, State Street, but this Embassy really turned my head and it will get first consideration on future stays downtown.
