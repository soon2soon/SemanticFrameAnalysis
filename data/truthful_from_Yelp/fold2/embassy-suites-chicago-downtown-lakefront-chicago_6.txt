Visit this location frequently for romantic getaways and for kid friendly getaways. Perfect for both. Never had a bad experience. The complimentary breakfast buffet complete with made-to-order omelet station is amazing and generally what tips the scale in favor of staying here. The nightly Managers Reception is also a bonus complete with hot and cold snacks and free drinks. The service is awesome and I always feel appreciated for choosing this location. I recommend visiting Thursday-Sunday when you can generally get a room in this all-suite hotel for as low as $99. The location is within a block of Lucky Strikes and AMC theatre and a short walk to Navy Pier. Will continue to visit and can only hope the consistency of incredible service never changes. So far so good...been visiting for about 5 years now.
