I booked this hotel 3 months before I came into town for the Chicago Marathon. I've stayed at other hotels in the area & honestly couldn't get into the hotels I've been to before. I lucked out because I learned the Fairmont is the BEST hotel in Chicago. It's a beautiful hotel that's very well maintained. The staff is superb. Our suite was amazing! It was huge, clean with a spectacular view from all windows. Every night our beds were turned down & water bottles placed next to our bed. The spa & gym are beautiful. This hotel was on a perfect location. It was within walking distance of Millennium Park, Navy Pier, & Michigan Ave. I will only stay at the Fairmont when I am in Chicago from now on!
