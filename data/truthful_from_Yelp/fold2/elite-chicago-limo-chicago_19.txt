I used this company last weekend for a Friday night ride and a Saturday night ride. Needless to say the Friday night ride was much more incredible than the Saturday night ride. Our driver, who I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a good time, Harold, truly knows how to show you and your party a great time. My friends and I really enjoyed our time taking this bus to and from a Lollapalooza after party! I cannot wait to do business with this company again in the future. But, it will only ever be with Harold!
