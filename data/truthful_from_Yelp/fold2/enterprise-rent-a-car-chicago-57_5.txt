These guys are leaders in the sometimes excruciating car rental game. I waited about 5 minutes for a shuttle pickup at the terminal and then waited about 5 minutes in line at the facility. Not too bad! The check in girl was very helpful and friendly, and didn't overdo it with the upselling attempts. She brought me to a Ford Focus with 800 miles on it. The car was in great condition, and she encouraged me to walk around the car with her to find any pre-existing damage "just in case." In the past I've rented from cheaper companies (thrifty, dollar) and I've had cars that were dented to hell and had 40,000 miles and bald tires. Returning the car was just as easy. They were ready for me, grabbed my luggage out of the trunk (wow!), and I was on the shuttle to the terminal. From now on I'm going to spend the extra few bucks and book with these guys.
