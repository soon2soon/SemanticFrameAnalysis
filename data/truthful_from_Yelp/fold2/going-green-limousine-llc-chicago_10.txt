Jeff D arrived on time and with the infant car seat requested (he actually had TWO so we could choose which one). A very pleasant and professional driver. The receptionists at the Going Green Limousine are very good, professional, and although they will take your credit card over the phone, it makes for a quicker ending to the trip as all is paid and done.
