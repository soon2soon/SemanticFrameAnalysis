My tour guide is Meadows. He is a very responsible and funny person. I participate the three hours segway trip. It is a good time to ride the segway in Chicago. I appreciate the small group (only 7 people per group) rule. They can take good care of everyone. I will definitely come back to join their architecture trip next time.
