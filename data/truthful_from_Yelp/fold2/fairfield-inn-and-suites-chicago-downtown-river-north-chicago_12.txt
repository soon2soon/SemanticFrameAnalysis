Very friendly staff & good location combined with the price makes this a great place to stay in Chicago. Clean rooms! Valet staff professional & quick 62.00 a bit pricey but it's the big city . The only negative is there is a firestation across the street Â so expect some noise if called out. But it is quick to cease. Breakfast staff very accommodating too! Will be my place to stay in Chicago.
