7,120 check-ins later, I am still the Mayor! Back when the Brown Line went through extensive renovation going down to three tracks, the Belmont train station looked like a scene from some post-apocalyptic nightmare. Late night three track operation also made waiting a genuine pain in the you know what. Once all the scaffolding was removed, sawdust swept away, and concrete hardened, we're left with one of Chicago's most beautiful train stations. Walking in, you'll feel some space even in the dead of rush hour as the walkways have been dramatically expanded. You can now enter and exit from both sides of Belmont and there are plenty of escalators and elevators. Why is the Belmont stop so important? Being a connector for the Red, Brown, and Purple Lines, there are probably tens of thousands of people who use this train stop on a daily basis. I usually like to get off my train and walk four blocks up to Wrigley Field and like the fact that when I'm waiting for the train, there is now an electronic sign with approximate ETAs. Yep the Belmont train station does have post-Cubs traffic, plenty of wild people from Boystown nearby as well as a hell of a lot of people during rush hour. I still like this train station since it almost seems like the center of the north side. Good food abound in the surrounding neighborhood and a stone's step away from Wrigleyville. And now I'm the Duke!
