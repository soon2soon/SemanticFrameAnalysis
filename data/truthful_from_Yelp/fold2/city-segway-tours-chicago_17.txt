Meadow is the best tour guide ever! We took the three hour tour that gave us a great intro to the parks, riverfront and museums of Chicago.  We stopped at many great view spots to snap pictures and learn a little about Chicago.  Our group had prior Segway experience so we had virtually no training time which allowed us to go down around Soldier field as well.   We have done Segway tours in other cities and City Segway Tours has been the best we have toured with.  Prior tour guides were a bit cranky.  City Segway Tours was professional, safe and fun.  A great way to start our visit to Chicago.
