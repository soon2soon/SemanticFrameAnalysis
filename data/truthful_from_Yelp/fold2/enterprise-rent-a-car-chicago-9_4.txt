Three words sum up my experience with Enterprise: Excellent customer service I literally, without calling ahead, came from Gerber next door after dropping off my car to get fixed and was automatically able to rent a car for a week. Darius was the one helping me out and he was totally awesome and speedy. He was able to get all my information and get my car ready while talking on the phone and dealing with 2 other customers at the same time. Enterprise then called me two days later to see how the car was working out for me which was a nice gesture. Returning my car was even easier. Again, Darius was awesome and got me ready and out super quickly. Later in the day I realized I left my garage door opener in the vehicle but they had already closed. I called in on Monday morning and was told by the lady that she'd check the vehicle again after it got returned. A few hours later, I got a call back from the same lady saying she found it and to come pick it up anytime. I wish I could remember her name so that I can give her due credit but she is just as great as Darius - super nice and friendly and always working there. These two should really get a raise for the great job they're doing!
