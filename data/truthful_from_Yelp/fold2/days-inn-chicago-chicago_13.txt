Great hotel! Beautiful neighborhood with lots of shopping and local restaurants within walking distance, and only a few blocks away from two rail lines and beautiful Lincoln Park. The room was the nicest I've seen for a Days Inn and the breakfast was pretty good too. The price was also very low considering how close this hotel is to the Loop.
