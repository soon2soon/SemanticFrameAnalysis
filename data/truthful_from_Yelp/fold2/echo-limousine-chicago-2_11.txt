We used Echo Limousine throughout our trip to Chicago over the 2014 holiday season and I cannot say enough about how professional and excellent the service was.  Nash was our first driver with a brand new Lincoln Town Car and we requested him every time we used Echo (~10 times) during our 12-day trip.  He was always 5-10 minutes early, extremely courteous and professional and knew when to engage in conversation while always attending to his driving first.  Additionally, Tanya was extremely helpful as their dispatcher.  Our daughter was graduating from a naval program in the Great Lakes area which involved a varied schedule and several early mornings.  Tanya was always detail-oriented regarding our timeline, destination points and ensuring our price was adjusted fairly.  Overall, Echo was consistently excellent in timeliness, cleanliness and price point.  I recommend them highly!
