Modern, clean, great friendly staff, and affordable. My whole family visited this hotel and we were all impressed. The hotel is right in the center of downtown Chicago and walking distance from everything. The staff goes over and above to make you feel welcome and makes it a point to make sure your time there is enjoyable. They provide a great breakfast until 10 - later than most hotels. They were extremely considerate especially when the weather turned extremely cold. The staff was so helpful, really knowing the city, including great places to eat and things to do as well as how to get there. Â The weight room is shared with the Hyatt and is kept very clean with all the equipment working. They even have headphones available for tv viewing! We loved our stay and will definitely be using them in the future!
