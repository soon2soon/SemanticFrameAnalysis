My friends and I came here for a bachelorette party & enjoyed our stay. Four Seasons Hotel Chicago did an wonderful job making our stay memorable. The hotel location is great! This place was beautiful. The place is super chic and clean. I got the 1 bedroom suite, and there was a King size bed in my room, the room itself was very large and spacious, Â even the bathroom was huge, including both a tub & a shower. The service was top notch. I have never experienced better customer service at a hotel before. The front desk & concierge were helpful & so nice! They everything clearly enjoy working here. I had a great experience here. Thank you!
