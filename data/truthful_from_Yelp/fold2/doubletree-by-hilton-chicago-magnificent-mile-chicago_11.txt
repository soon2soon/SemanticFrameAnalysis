This place was amazing! My husband and I stayed here for one of our last nights as Chicagoians. We both grew up in the suburbs but were moving to Southern California, so we wanted to go out with a bang and spend a night in the city and hang out at a fun hotel, and we were super pumped with this one! The room was super clean and cute, the view was amazing, everything was perfect! PLUS, who doesn't love warm chocolate chip cookies?! :)
