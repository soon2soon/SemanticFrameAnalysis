I was not expecting much from this hotel, as the rates were really quite low. I was pleasantly surprised at what a nice place this was! The location was fabulous- within 1-2 mile walking distance of every possible thing you could want to see in Chicago. The staff- from the doormen & housekeepers to the front desk, they were all incredibly friendly, professional, & helpful. Our room itself was great- clean & had everything we needed: a tv, desk, phone, wonderfully hot shower, Chicago guide book, & restaurant delivery menus. The restaurant/pub attached to the hotel was great, as well. My husband & I just had some beer and sat at the bar, but the bartender was super friendly & helpful in suggesting beer choices. The cherry on top: the water bottles in each hallway that you could fill up with cold, filtered water. I'd never seen that done before & it was such a neat little perk that really made you feel as though you were special.
