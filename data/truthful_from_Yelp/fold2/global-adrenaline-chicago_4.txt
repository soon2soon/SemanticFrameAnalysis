This review is a long time coming.  Global Adrenaline helped us plan our honeymoon last fall.   We were looking for a place that had both adventure as well as relaxing sites. In the end we settled on Belize, 1 week in the jungle and 1 week on the coastal town of Placencia.  The tours organized by GA in the jungle (Mayan Cave Hike, Jungle Hike) during the day were perfectly balanced with the FF Coppola eco resort's amenities were memorable. The transfers from airports were seemless. Placencia is a little gem of a town with great cafes, restaurants and amazing scuba. Couldn't have planned a better honeymoon than the one Global Adrenaline set up for us. Well done Mer and team! Well done!
