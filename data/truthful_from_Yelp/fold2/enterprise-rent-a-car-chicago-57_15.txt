I arrived at the O'Hare Enterprise yesterday from a 21-hour marathon drive from Ft. Myers, FL after Spirit Airlines cancelled my flight, marooning 400+ O'Hare-bound passengers. Returning the car went without a hitch, but the problem was that I was still stranded, as my car was parked at the Mariott in Des Plaines.  The guys at Enterprise referred me to their shuttle bus.  Driver Tracy was amazing - not only did he insist on loading/unloading my bags, but he was charming and funny, providing some much-needed comedic relief after my ordeal.  He drove me to the O'Hare Hotel shuttle area and left me smiling despite my still having a 1.5 hour drive ahead of me.  Thanks Tracy!
