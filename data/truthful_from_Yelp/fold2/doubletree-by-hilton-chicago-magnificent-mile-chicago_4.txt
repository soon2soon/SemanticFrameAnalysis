This is a review for the doubletree cookies! My boyfriend and I gift these to each other as a treat! When I happen to be in streeterville and see the doubletree hotel I drop by for some freshly baked cookies. They come individual or in a tin. I have stopped by to purchase a tin (6 cookies) and they come from the kitchen. The receptionist is usually super nice and throw in a few extra fresh cookies! These chocolate chip cookies are chewy in the middle and crisp on the edges. The cookies have semi sweet chocolate chips and walnuts in them. Delicious and a special treat! The packaging is nice and comes in a very sturdy handle bag. Try them for yourself and is perfect as a gift for someone special.
