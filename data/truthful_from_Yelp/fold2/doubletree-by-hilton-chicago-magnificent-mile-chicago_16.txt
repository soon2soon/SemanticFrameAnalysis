The staff here are so friendly and accommodating! Ask for their complementary (warm) chocolate chip cookie at the front desk... soooo bomb! I dare you to eat only 1! Also, if you stay here you will get a voucher for 20% off your bill at Timothy O'tools, a bar around the corner. Overall, a good experience
