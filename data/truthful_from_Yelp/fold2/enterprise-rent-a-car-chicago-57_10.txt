OH, MY GOSH, THIS WAS THE EASIEST, FASTEST and BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE, that I've seen in YEARS!! We picked up the phone at the airport, asked for information, told them we wanted to rent one of their cars.....we were in their van within minutes. Then once we got to the rental place, we were 'processed' very quickly, offered some bottled water and boom we were in the parking lot - choosing the car we wanted. EVERY CAR RENTAL SHOULD BE LIKE THIS !!! FIVE STARS PLUS.
