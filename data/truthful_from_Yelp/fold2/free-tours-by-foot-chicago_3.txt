My husband and I enjoyed the tour. I am from Chicago, but recently moved out of state. I was interested in the pedway tour to see what new things had happened in my absence. Bruce has a lot of enthusiasm and knows a great deal of history of the area. While the tour is free- we felt that we would have easily paid for such an extensive review and left $20 for Bruce's time.
