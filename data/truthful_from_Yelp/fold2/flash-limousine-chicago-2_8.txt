I booked Flash Limousine's 24 passenger party bus for my Birthday party this past weekend. It was awesome!! During the planning, I had to call about 4 times because I kept coming up with questions, but Shana was incredibly patient, helpful, and extremely pleasant to work with. The only issue I had was the paying process. If you use a cc, a cc authorization form had to be completed and returned. If you have access to a printer, that's no problem. However, if you use a smartphone, you can't complete the form because there is no way to type anything on it, so that was a bit inconvenient. Otherwise, things went well. The bus was at my location a little early (so as not to be late), which I appreciated. The bus was clean, had a great sound system and was all I was hoping it would be. The driver was really nice, and very professional. I would absolutely use Flash Limousine again and highly recommend them to anyone looking to book a party bus.
