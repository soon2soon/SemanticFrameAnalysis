I can't think of a single thing wrong with our experience here at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, from the beginning to the end of our visit.  Our room was very comfortable, with our own microwave, sink, mini fridge, coffee - everything we needed to feel right at home.  It also had free wifi and in-room printing - so nice. We took time to check out the lobby and the downstairs.  There were computers for us to print our boarding pass and go online, and conferencr rooms downstairs in a nice lounge area.  There's also a fitness center, which I think is pretty equipped for its size. The location is fabulous, so close to everything.  The pub next door looks fun, although we didn't have time to check it out. All in all, I cannot think of a single complaint about my two night stay there.  If I come back as a tourist to Chicago, I will definitely stay here again.
