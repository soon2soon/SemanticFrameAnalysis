The Elysian Hotel is absolutely the most luxurious hotel in all of Chicago. I had a mini two-night staycation here recently, and every detail of my visit was flawless. Even before you enter the hotel, a handsome doorman greets you graciously and opens every door for you to pass. While the lobby is small, it is bright, clean, and looks like a Grecian palace. The giant chandelier is just the start of all of the sparkly things you'll see here. Yes, I'd like to move in immediately. The decor is very modern, with some traditional pieces. European chic and tres glamorous. We were in a standard guest room, but there was nothing standard about it. It was quite size-able with separate closets for each of us. We switched on the fireplace, which made the room quite toasty on such a cold night. Love. The bathroom had gorgeous white Carrera marble counters with a giant soaking tub, Asprey bath amenities and a mirror that doubles as a television. How cool is that?? A smaller chandelier lights of the bathroom, giving it even more luxury and charm. While the Elysian is quite elaborate and decadent, it is also very quiet and understated. There is no music in the lobby and the staff is wonderful. It's almost like they are welcoming you home. The Peninsula, Four Seasons and Trump are all great, but don't even compare to my experience at the Elysian.
