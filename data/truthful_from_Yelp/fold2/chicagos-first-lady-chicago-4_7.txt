An ABSOLUTE MUST for any visitor or local! For the 3 of us on this tour, it was a first for all! My husband and I dropped off my father so he could have assistance getting on the boat, (so if you're in a wheelchair, be prepared to have two monster guys lift you, wheelchair and all ~ onto the boat. The "ramp" has a giant drop at the end.) When we arrived, my father was seated in the front (the only wheelchair accessible area) where we were also met with rain. Thankfully it wasn't a downpour, but sprinkling enough to make you miserable. Fortunately they sell rain ponchos! Another couple bought my dad a poncho before we boarded, which was so kind! They wouldn't even let us pay them back. (They were probably from Canada.) So my husband and I bought our two ponchos at the bar, and away we go! Not only do they give you amazing architectural history, but what I never knew was the architecture on the bridges and the gear rooms. Since I come from a family of know-it-alls (myself included) we laughed each time my dad would give commentary on some building before the woman on the loudspeaker would mention it. I think I also learned a great deal about my dad that day, since I now know of all the random places he would go and take a nap. Apparently my dad is like a cat, and needs to nap often. The most bizarre thing also occurred on this tour, for part of the tour there was a guy on land running along side of the boat route. At first I thought he was a jogger, but then realized he was chasing the darn boat! A few times we were placing bets if he was going to jump in the water, which actually had me a little nervous. Thankfully we lost him.
