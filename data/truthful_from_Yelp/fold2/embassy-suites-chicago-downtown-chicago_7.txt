Great stay. I got exactly what I wanted: very reasonably priced hotel with free hot breakfast and great amount of space, close to everything in the downtown area that I'd want to see. There were kids and families moreso than the experience I'd get at a cosmopolitan boutique hotel (which isn't my favorite) but other than in the pool area, I didn't really see them. The staff (especially the front desk [Thomas]) is so responsive and awesome. The breakfast and managers reception makes the stay worth it. As a hotel, it's not a four star, but it's inexpensive, good looking, and has the best kind of amenities for a person like me (twenty something wanting to be downtown). I'd stay here again and recommend it. Long story short, if you are looking to be in your room chilling and come out to be out in downtown or taking advantage of the frills, come here. If you want a "hotel experience" of a chic stay, go to a boutique but don't expect even half of the amenities and twice the price.
