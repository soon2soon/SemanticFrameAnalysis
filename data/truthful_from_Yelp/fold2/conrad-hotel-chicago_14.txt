Where to start about our trip to the Conrad.  I was incredibly impressed by this hotel.  I wanted to take a few friends on a trip to Chicago and live high for a few days.  I know I liked the Conrad in NYC so I figured why not try this one out and I could not be more satisfied.  I decided to reserve an executive suite and I suggest you do the same! The room seemed well over 1000 sq feet (1501) I believe because it was above a terrace suite.  There was a nice hallway when you entered with a guest bathroom (powder room) to the left then the nicely appointed living room to the right.  Down the hall on the left was the bedroom which was easily 500 sq feet with a sitting area and a separate sound system than the living room.  The bathroom was nicely appointed and very large which was great with four guys throwing their stuff all over.  The complimentary water was great at 4am when we got back from the bars and the staff was always as accomidating as possible.  I have stayed at Four Seasons and Waldorfs and this room lived up to my expectations.  Pay the extra and upgrade because it is definitely worth it!
