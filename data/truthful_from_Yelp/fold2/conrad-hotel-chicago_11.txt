Probably one of the best all-around city hotels that I've had the pleasure of visiting. If you know your plans ahead of time, the advance purchase rate at the Conrad can be nearly half the price you'd pay compared to booking things last-minute. We got a great rate directly through the hotel, and I downloaded the Concierge App to my iphone and was able to pre-check in, request a room on a higher level facing Michigan Ave, and request a pillow menu, all before even getting there! The hotel is located next to the Red Line Grand CTA stop, so public transportation isn't an issue. There's 24-hour access to the hotel from Michigan Ave and it's attached to the largest Nordstrom in Chicago. Free wi-fi is a sweet touch and the "free wine" happy hour from 6-7 on Sunday-Thursday was also a nice perk. The hotel itself is a little awkward because the lobby is on the 5th floor of the building, but once you get up there, the common areas are sleek and modern, almost a little Jonathan Adler-like. Reception staff were super friendly, always welcoming, and willing to go the extra mile. Our room was not lacking in size and the bed was so, so comfortable. Large LG flat screen TVs, Bose sound system with ipod hook ups, massive bathroom with soaking tub and separate stand-alone shower....it was really ideal. Free coffee and tea in the lobby each morning. Things to note: no pool, only one restaurant, breakfast pricey, hotel room felt vaguely damp. They didn't matter much to us, however. It's not the Four Seasons or Waldorf, but it's not trying to be. What it is, however, is a beautiful, spacious, centrally located hotel at a reasonable price.
