Costa Rica Experts helped me plan an incredible romantic getaway. I had the pleasure of visiting the Caribbean and Pacific Coasts. The only snag we had was one of the roads were close because of a mudslide, but Costa Rica Experts local office was quick to the fix the issue and find us an alternative route to get to our destination. Both my partner and I were most impressed with Expert's recommendations to stay in a friendly safe secluded cabin located in our own little rainforest. We had, what felt like, a private beach at Almonds and Corals and the food was amazing. We were excited about how eco-friendly all of the accommodations were. I think my favorite part of the trip was spending time in Lapa Rios. Â The staff were awesome and knowledgeable about everything Costa Rica. We had an opportunity to visit an animal sanctuary (Cana Blanca) and discovered all the amazing work they are doing to save animals. I think anyone can go on a website and book a trip to Costa Rica, but you really need experts to design a trip that is unique and right for you. I'm happy to have used Costa Rica Experts, not only did they know what was a right fit for me but I felt like I had a friend in the country incase anything happened. I highly recommend Costa Rica Experts if you are planning a trip to Costa Rica.
