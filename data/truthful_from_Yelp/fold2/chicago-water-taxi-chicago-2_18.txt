It is the most convenient way to travel to and from work (for me) while avoiding the summer crowd of tourists on the CTA during rush hour. The schedule is perfect for rush hour commuters; get the monthly pass or the ten ride. It's worth it! You can also transfer to the Chinatown taxi at Madison. Getting to work and back has never been more beautiful in summer!
