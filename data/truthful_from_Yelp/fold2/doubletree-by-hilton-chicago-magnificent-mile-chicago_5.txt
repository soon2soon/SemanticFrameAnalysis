I stay in ALOT of hotels for work so when I get a good one in always a happy camper. This hotel is in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the action. The front desk staff was friendly and attentive and offered to hold our bag until our room was ready. The bellhop even made some great chicago pizza recommendations for us tourists which were right on point! There is a restaurant/bar off to the side which is open late if you find yourself in need of a nightcap (like I normally need). The rooms were nice and spacious and overlooked the pool which made for some great people watching and swimming fails. My only complaint was really the elevators... They were SO SLOW. It took forever to go up or down at any time during the day. There is a utility elevator you can use if you can find it which will speed your visit up a bit. I would definitely return if I found myself back in chicago! Quiet, staff was great, elevators take too long
