Wow for the price I paid I had a delightful stay.  Sure the bed was a queen so my girlfriend and I had a slightly tighter squeeze since we are used to a King Tempurpedic but the bed was still very comfortable.  I could not hear our neighbors and the view was fantastic which consisted of Trump Tower and Marina City.  The room had a 32in LCD and a nice desk.  The toilet was not elongated but was still powerful enough to take down what threw at it.  I loved the complementary bottled water but the ice machine was in the basement.  The customer service was great.  But when we were about to leave for a night on the town I think I confused the front desk guy since when he asked if he needed me to call I cab I said, "No thank you," and darted out into the street and stated to blow my rape whistle in order to hail again."  If I am ever on a budget and need a place to stay in the city this will be it.   The location is great since you are right on the border of the loop and River North.
