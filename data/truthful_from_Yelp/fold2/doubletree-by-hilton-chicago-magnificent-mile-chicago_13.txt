5 stars for Derrick :-) The interior of the hotel could use a little love (new carpeting), but overall- excellent customer service. The parking situation is appalling. After paying what I paid nightly for 4 nights, guest parking should be free. Put that in your suggestion box... One gentleman in particular really stood out. His name was Derrick (I am not sure if he was the concierge or the bell hop). This employee went out of his way to help my friend and I with parking, unloading our bags, etc. By the time we arrived at the hotel we were absolutely exhausted. Derrick was a tremendous help. He even called our room as an alarm in the morning just to make sure we woke up on time. Thanks friend!
