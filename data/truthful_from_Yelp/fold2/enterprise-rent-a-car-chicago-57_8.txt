Lots of bad reviews about car rental places.  Enterprise definitely wow'ed me and next time i need to rent I will seek them out, especially at O'Hare. Disclaimer, it is a little far away from the airport, but the shuttle is fast and free and the driver is very friendly and helpful. Out shuttle was full and there was one pulling up right in front of us.  I have spent well over an hour waiting on a busy line at a rental place before so I jumped off and ran in to beat the crowd. Well that was unnecessary.  They had a manager greeting everyone at the door and they have about 5 check-in people available.  Check-in was very pleasant.  I was upgraded to an SUV for free.  They gave bottles of water to my entire 4 person group. Drop-off was equally easy.  They have 3 lanes that you drive up to with an employee who scans a barcode with a handheld scanner while doing a quick walk around.  By the time you get out of the car, he has a paper for you to sign and you are done.  We walked over to the waiting shuttle and we were off. After some bad experiences with rental places and reading some bad reviews, I can honestly say that I was blown away by Enterprise.
