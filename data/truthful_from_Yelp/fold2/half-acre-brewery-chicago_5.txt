This is clearly one of the top breweries in the City of Chicago and an amazing taproom to match.  The big bear head behind the bar is a nice touch.  The artwork on one wall is intriguing and I'm not sure of the significance yet.  Another wall has rustic wood with many imperfections and waves which could be art in itself.   Let's not forget why we came....for the beer.  I ordered a Vellajo and was not disappointed.  I have not seen this beer in cans by my suburban home so it was nice to try.  They don't have food and it's only a tap room but you can have food delivered.  They have menus from local restaurants to look over.   I look forward to visiting again.
