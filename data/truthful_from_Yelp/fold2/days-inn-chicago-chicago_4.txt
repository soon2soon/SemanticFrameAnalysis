We have been fortunate enough to be able to visit our newest grandson on a monthly basis since last August. Every month we have enjoyed the accommodations provided by Days Inn - Chicago. You can expect a pleasant greeting beginning at the front door by a very professional staff. The rooms are first rate, comfortable beds, complimentary wi-fi and a nice free breakfast. This hotel is located in a fantastic neighborhood with many, many dining choices. There is a CTA bus stop right outside the hotel or it's a short walk to the CTA Brown Line. This is always our hotel of choice when we are in town.
