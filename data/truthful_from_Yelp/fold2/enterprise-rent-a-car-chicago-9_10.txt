I specifically chose this location rather than one closer to my home because the difference in the quality of the Yelp reviews was striking.  This location lived up to its excellent reviews.  Intelligent, friendly, helpful people work there.  I left my favorite pair of shoes in the car when I returned it and didn't realize until about three weeks later. (They're my favorites but I don't wear them very often.) I was shocked that they still had them in their lost and found, they didn't throw them out.  Service!
