(review started back a few months ago and never finished. Sorry for the delay, DTree staff)   This was my third stay at this hotel, my third year as a Hilton Honors Diamond member, and I have always found the thought of asking for upgrades or extras absolutely embarrassing.  The staff here assured that I did not have to ask!  I received a call from the front desk, who was checking to make sure that everything was okay with my room, and if I needed anything.  I jokingly said "mmmmmm tiramisu!"  The lady said that they didn't have it on the menu and apologized, and I assured her that I was COMPLETELY joking, and laughed it off. 30 minues later, I get a knock on the door.... It's hotel staff, who had spoken to the chef, who had specially made me a small tiramisu and a personally written card thanking me for my business.  Serious - this made 135 nights a year away from my own bed worth while. Other than that: There is the warm DTree cookies at check in... standard.... The staff is very helpful and nice.  The hotel and rooms have been inexpensive, clean and comfortable.  It's in a great downtown Chicago location, as well.   I recommend this hotel to anynone on business, or someone looking to be within a short walk from heaps of downtown sights.
