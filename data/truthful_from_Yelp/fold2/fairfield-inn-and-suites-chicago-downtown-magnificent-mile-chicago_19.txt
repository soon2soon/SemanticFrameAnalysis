I enjoyed staying at the Fairfield Inn; it is right near Michigan Ave, and near all the other Chicago attractions (navy pier, museums, dinning). The lobby was gorgeous, the staff was friendly, and my room was nice. Like many hotels they had a free breakfast which was pretty good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a cheap hotel room near Michigan Ave. I live in suburbs and wanted a cheap place to stay for the weekend so i could entertain some family members that came in from out of town to visit Chicago, and this hotel was perfect for the occasion.
