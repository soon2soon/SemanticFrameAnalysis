I greatly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It had gorgeous views, delicious breakfast, and delivered on all the hotel essentials. I was in Chicago on a business trip and was surprised that I had been placed in an Embassy Suites by my client. I only had stayed at an Embassy Suites as a child, sharing the pull out couch with my sister and drinking Shirley Temples during cocktail hour. I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations! The lobby is modern, with big glass elevators offering a magnificent view of the Chicago skyline. My room was very clean,  spacious, and accommodated with a mini-fridge and microwave. Score! Best of all was the free cocktail hour. Not only were there drinks, but yummy evening snacks, everything from veggies, hummus, and trail mix to mini-corn dogs, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. What's better than coming back from work to a free cocktail hour and snacks?! The breakfast was also very nice and was definitely not your traditional hotel continental breakfast. Warm food, made-to-order options, and a great selection, all included in your stay. There was an obvious change between guests from Sunday-Wednesday and Thursday-Saturday nights. The beginning of the week was filled with mostly business travelers, but on Thursday night there was an obvious influx of families. Definitely consider this hotel for both. It's quiet,  comfortable, and just offers a more 'at home' feeling that most hotels lack.
