A group of us went through this company to help us plan our trip to Peru, specifically the Inka Trail, Machu Picchu and then a side trip to the Amazon.  We weren't sure if at first we should go through a company or just plan the trip ourselves.  I'll tell ya it was damn worth it to go through Global!   It was more than I expected cost wise for the entire trip (flights, hotel, trail, etc) but the convenience of having the trip planned and all the small details covered was worth every penny.  It was stress free for the entire two week trip!  Our group had the most memorable trip and couldn't have gone any better. Time to save up and get another group to go somewhere else now!  Maybe Argentina or Chile?  Africa?  hmmmm.
