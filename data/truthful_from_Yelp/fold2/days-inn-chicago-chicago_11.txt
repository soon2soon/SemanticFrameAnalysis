I moved to live in Chicago and stayed in this hotel.  It is one of the more affordable options and is very good for the price - $125 for 1 person queen size bed.   I stayed here several nights and found the rooms (I changed rooms because I booked additional nights), clean and comfortable with all the additional extras which are useful.  TV, desk, coffee maker, etc.  The reception staff were very helpful, as they were full for the night after my initial 2 night booking, and I needed longer, and they got back to me later in the day when there was a cancellation.  They also gave me good advice on life in Chicago.   Very pleased with my experience here.
