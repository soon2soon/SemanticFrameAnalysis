This weekend I made a reservation at Budget car rental who neglected to make it clear I needed to have four hundred dollars to hold in my account on top if the amount. I was so mad as they were not releasing the money for my refund. I called enterprise ready to snap budget was taking away my vacation after I worked 89 hrs two weeks in a row. This enterprise walked me through getting my bank to fix it then made sure I had the nicest car option with great gas. I will never go to budget again. The manager Brian I would now consider a friend their help meant the world and saved my vacation.
