The best Hotel experience I have ever had.  I travel in excess of 150 nights per year and stay in several hotels but The Four Seasons Chicago is by far the most exceptional.  The rooms are beautiful, the lounge has great ambiance and the food/drinks are unbelievable.  I will definitely return as the service was impeccable.
