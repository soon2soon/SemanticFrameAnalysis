I got the cupcake tour for my sister for her birthday with a Groupon, who is obsessed with cupcakes. We ended up going and also brought our mom. It was awesome and delicious! Seth was an awesome tour guide. He kept everyone informed with fun facts about the city, and made us laugh while doing so. Also, I have an issue with gluten (like I said, it was a present for my sister, I just went along to celebrate!) so Seth tried to find gluten free options for me when he could, which I didn't expect and thought was extra thoughtful and much appreciated. Only about half of the stops had gluten free cupcakes, but it was a cupcake tour - I didn't expect any to be gluten free at all, so it was a great surprise! My mom has arthritis and it was a little more walking than we expected for her, but there were plenty of opportunities to sit and rest if needed (Seth said they've had people celebrating their 60-something wedding anniversary, so he can accomodate anyone!), so my mom still really enjoyed it.
