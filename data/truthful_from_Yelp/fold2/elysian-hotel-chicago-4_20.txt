Unbelievable. The best hotel experience I've ever had. I can't imagine going to a different hotel for our next Chicago stay-cation. The room, the bed, the service, the spa, the restaurants... it's hard to believe a place like this is real, and not just a figment of my imagination. Next time we're staying two nights! WOOT!
