My husband and I have rented from this location twice, and both time they have gone above and beyond great customer service to ensure we were happy with the vehicle we were renting. I cannot thank Rain enough for her kindness during our last rental. We are fortunate to live across the street from such a wonderful car rental company, it makes unplanned traveling so much less stressful.
