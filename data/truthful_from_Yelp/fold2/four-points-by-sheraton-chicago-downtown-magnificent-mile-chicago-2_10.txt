Not only just here in Chicago. The Points are great throughout the country. So, pull out you plastic and pay....its going to cost you 3Bills per night here...But soooohhh worth it. You love the soft beds; view if you get one; and the connivence of the city and walkability for tourist. Montez G says, RECOMMEND! OH! The Wi-Fi, is not free here. Â But just go to the front desk and ask for a comp night very nicely (flirty) (but wait until someone cute is at the desk; and go for it) and you just may get it.
