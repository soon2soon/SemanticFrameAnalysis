We stayed for one night. The interior was modern & definitely hip.  Like many said, the views were amazing, which comes with the side effect of feeling like you are on display.  Thankfully they have some serious window treatments, so you can still sleep until noon easily. There are plenty of places to walk to in the general vicinity and also the bar and restaurant on-site.  Staff was attentive and nice.  The one thing that I thought was odd was that we couldn't find a coffee maker in the room.
