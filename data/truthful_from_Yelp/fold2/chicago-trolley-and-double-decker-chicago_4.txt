I usually do the hop on hop off tours in most cities I visit because it's an easy way to get to all the attractions.   We went to Chicago the weekend of thanksgiving,  so with only three days to explore we had to be organized and structured,  the trolley helped us do that. The first day Temps were about 20 so walking would have been uncomfortable, for us Miami girls atleast. So we grabbed the trolley by the Hilton and just rode it through  all there stops, staying warm while listening to the tour guide explain Chicago's history. We also did the Christmas lights tour, which was a great way of starting off the season, visiting Lincoln Zoo Lights and the German Market, and met the sweetest couple and son. Overall I loved Chicago,  and the Chicago Trolley company made it that much more memorable. I highly recommend.
