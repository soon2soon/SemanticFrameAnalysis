The staff at this hotel are phenomenal! We had a very late arrival and the staff made sure we were welcome when we got there. The free breakfast was well worth it and a definite plus. WiFi is also included and a business center to print boarding passes. For a city hotel, the rooms are very large and hardly any noise from outside could be heard. We stayed during the Chicago Marathon when the hotel was packed, and things were still running smoothly!
