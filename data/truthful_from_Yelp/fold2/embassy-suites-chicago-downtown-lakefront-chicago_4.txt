This hotel is very high end, for not so high end price point.  It does get pricey during certain times but the price you pay for being in this location for this grade of hotel is very very reasonable.  Very well kept hotel and parking garage.  Parking was only $39, most other over night hotels in downtown are $59+ per night for parking.  Location wise couldn't ask for a better location.
