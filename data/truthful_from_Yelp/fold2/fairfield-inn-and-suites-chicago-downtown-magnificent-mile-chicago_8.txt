Great location downtown.  We walked to Mag Mile, State Street shops, Navy Pier for the fireworks.  Everyone was friendly and so helpful.  We didn't like the location of our room and they immediately and graciously took us to a different one which was great.  Very clean, nice pillows.  Tons of choices at breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again.
