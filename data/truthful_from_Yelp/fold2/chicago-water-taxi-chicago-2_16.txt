Great way to travel around the city and get to some of Chicago's major attractions (Michigan Ave, Chinatown) while getting a glimpse of Chicago's beautiful riverside architecture. I was surprised how well the taxis kept to the posted schedule. They seem very reliable. The boarding/de-boarding process was also fast and efficient. The boats are bright yellow (you can't miss them) and are very clean. There's covered seating in the center of the boat as well as open-air seating in the front and back. Prices are reasonable, and I've heard you can find coupons for half off rides at Union station (look on the walls where they have the rows and rows of brochures for tourists). If you're paying by credit card, buy your ticket at the machine at the station before boarding; it only accepts cards. If you're paying cash, you can buy your ticket on board.
