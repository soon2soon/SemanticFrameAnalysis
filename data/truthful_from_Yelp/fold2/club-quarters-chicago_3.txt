Awesome location, it was close to everything touristy you would want to do in the loop. Price was decent and included free wifi. They do have valet parking which is convenient but pricey. I would suggest parking at the non-valet garage unless you have a lot of luggage to haul. The garage is a few blocks away so in the winter that's not a fun walk. Room was bedbug free and clean. Only slight complaint would be the air vents are a little loud but compared to other hotels nearby it's worth the price.
