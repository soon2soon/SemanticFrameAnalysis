This Enterprise had excellent customer service. We rented a compact for a week, plus insurance, for 2 drivers for about $440. It was pretty pricey, but our experience here was great. We got a free upgrade to a Toyota Corolla (also had a choice of an Impala) and it was in tip-top shape. No complaints here! The service was really outstanding in how quick and friendly it was.
