I have lived in Chicago for over 5 years and it's about time i've gotten onto a Segway. I booked with Clark. He was so pleasant to work with and quite funny too. He made the experience so much fun while conveying all of the important details that I needed to know coming into it. My brother and I took my dad for Fathers Day a few weeks ago. Hannah was our tour guide. We started off getting acquainted with the Segway's and learning how they work. Hannah was such a great teacher, we were all zipping around and weaving in and out of traffic with the best of em.The tour was a solid 3 hours long and featured most of the lake side downtown area on the south side of the Bean. Hannah was extremely knowledgable about all of the attractions and kept us all entertained and interested to learn more. She is a history teacher so the job fits her perfectly. I am antsy to take another tour (perhaps at night) as soon as possible. You Enjoyed Myself so much that I almost want to buy my own... We all know that isn't going to happen though, so I'll stick to City Segway. Clark and Hannah, thanks for the amazing time ;) See you soon!
