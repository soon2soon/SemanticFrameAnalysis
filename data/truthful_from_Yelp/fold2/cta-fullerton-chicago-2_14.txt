Too bad they couldn't have left it alone and saved Hayes-Healy Athletic Center & Demon Dogs. The new station is nice and was finished on 12/31/09. The new building doesn't really fit in with the neighborhood architecture. Serves DePaul's Lincoln Park Campus. Only reasons for expansion were capacity and to have handicap access as Fullerton could already have 8 train cars, and now it can have 10. It is nice that it is larger now and has an auxillary entrace in the historic station house on the north side of Fullerton.
