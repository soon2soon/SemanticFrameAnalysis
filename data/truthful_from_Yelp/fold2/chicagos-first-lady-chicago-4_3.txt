DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS TOUR!!! Do you like boats? do you like rivers? do you like history? do you like architecture? If yes to any, don't miss this. Unfortunately when I went, it was freezing and snowing and a bit breezy. BUT, we still did it. :: Boat :: - Yes, bathrooms. - Yes, concession/full bar - Irish coffee anyone ?!? - Seating indoors - Seating outdoors :: Tour :: - History - Buildings - Did you know the ferris wheel was invented for the worlds fair in chicago ?? Honestly, even with the freezing conditions, I'm so glad to have made this. So awesome to hear the history of all the buildings (Montgomery ward, chicago tribune/suntimes, jewelry building which had a drive thru elevator for cars, etc). The irish coffees helped keep me warm.
