Nice little hotel in the west loop, convenience to L and parks.  Rooms are tiny but comfortable.  Best amenity in a non amenity hotel - water bottles and chilled water dispenser by elevators.  Elephant and Castle restaurant and pub ajoins hotel.  Very pleasant staff and best of all, they are not only dog friendly but they love pets!  Very endearing.
