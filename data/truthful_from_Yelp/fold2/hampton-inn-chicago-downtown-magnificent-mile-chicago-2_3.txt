After reading some of these reviews I was hesitant about staying here but I'm glad I didn't listen. We had a great stay! Sure the hotel was under reno and sometimes the elevators were slow but when that happened staff came and immediately helped guests with elevators. We were there for 4 nights, 5 days and were constantly in and out of our rooms and seriously waited five minutes for an elevator, at the most. The staff was always friendly, helpful and professional. Our view was spectacular and the room was quite large. Everything seemed new and clean and comfortable. You can beat the location either. We walked everywhere we wanted to easily. So many complaining about the TV or room service?? You're in Chicago! Go out and enjoy the city and all the epic restaurants around you! I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others!
