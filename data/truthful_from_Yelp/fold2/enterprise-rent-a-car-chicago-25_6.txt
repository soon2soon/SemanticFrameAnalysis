I was sent to Enterprise by Progressive after my car was totaled, so I was in a pretty foul mood going into the situation, my Customer Service Representative, Jill, was really helpful and friendly, she made me feel very taken care of, gave me a great car, explained everything very clearly and took care of everything quickly while still making sure that I understood what was happening and the terms of the rental. I highly recommend renting a car from here, they picked me up from my home, and I had done all the paperwork and was back on the road in a rental car in about a half an hour.
