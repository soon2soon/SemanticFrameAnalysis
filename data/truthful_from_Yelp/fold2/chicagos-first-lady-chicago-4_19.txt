I enjoyed the first 60 minutes of the tour very much.  Our docent was very knowledgeable and Chicago is a gorgeous city. The last 30 minutes I was so cold all I wanted was just to get off the boat.  I was wearing many layers of wool and leather and it didn't matter.  Can I make a suggestion?  Offer blankets for the guests, even charge for them.  I would have bought one.  I realize you can go downstairs, but then you miss the tour.
