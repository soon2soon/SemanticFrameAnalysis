Since we would be calling Chicago our home base for a little while, we decided to do this tour to get better aquainted with our new city.  I like doing these tours because in short amount of time, you get good grasp of all things that the city has to offer.  You get an idea of where places are located and you also get a brief history as well.  It is even better when your tour guide is interactive with the group and can answer any questions.   This company is popular and gets very crowded during the peak summer months.  There a variety of tours to choose from, we opted to do the signature tour.  It might seem pricey at first, but it is a great way to avoid parking and if you are visiting for a limited amount of time, this is the best way to see the city without having to deal with the traffic.  You can get hop on/off at any stop as well.   If you are family visiting your sailor in Great Lakes, ask them to buy the trolley tickets through the MWR/ITT as there is a discount for this.
