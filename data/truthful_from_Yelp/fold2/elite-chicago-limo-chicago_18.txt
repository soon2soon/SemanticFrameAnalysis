Booked for a bachelorette party on 02/08. I received tons of quotes and they were by far the best price with the best customer service. They were so easy to reach by phone, whether it be the driver's number or main line. While we were out, I called for an earlier pick up from the bar and they were able to accommodate that. The drivers we had were both so nice and professional. Would definitely recommend Elite and I will be booking again.
