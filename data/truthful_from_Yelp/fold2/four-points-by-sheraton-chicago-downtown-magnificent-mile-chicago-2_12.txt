This hotel has  been great, the staff is so friendly.  They helped me out by checking my bags until room was available, and helping me find my way to my morning meeting.   I was upgraded even though I'm not even elite, to a junior suite on the top floor.  Plenty of restaurants are very accessible as well as the train and cabs.
