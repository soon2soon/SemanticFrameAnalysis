Awesome experience here. Everyone at the front desk was awesome, always made an effort to stay hello and were very welcoming. The location was second to none - in the heart of downtown and only a block and a half from a train station. The stay includes breakfast every morning which had a slightly wider selection than many other Hamptons I've stayed at. Also, this hotel was cheaper than any other hotel I could find in the area. I would definitely make an extra effort to stay here again next time I'm in Chicago!
