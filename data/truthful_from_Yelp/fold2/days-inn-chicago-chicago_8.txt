This place will blow away any budget traveler's expectations. It's located in a bustling but safe neighborhood with easy access to any part of the city, either by public transportation or by car. The service is top notch; everyone was so friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The hotel interior is beautiful with a classic charm, and the rooms are cute, cozy, exceptionally clean and well-appointed with simple yet modern decor. The climate control was perfect and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Despite the hotel being at max capacity due to a concert and a Cubs game, I didn't hear a peep from the other guests or from the outside world. I felt like we were tucked away somewhere private in our room. The amenities were plentiful and we took advantage of them all: valet parking, bellhop, secure luggage storage after check-out while we explored the city before departing, and the most plentiful free continental breakfast we ever had (which included the basics--cereal, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit--and some extras like eggs and waffles). All of this at a price point that I have paid at lesser hotels in smaller cities. Days Inn of Chicago is a tremendous value and I'm so glad to know that I have a nice, centrally located and affordable place to stay whenever I visit one of my favorite cities.
