This hotel is really a class act. We were on the 19th floor. Floor to ceiling windows sporting some of the best views you could get in Chicago. The bed is unbelievably soft and lush. The "see thru" showers are weird but there are curtains to get rid of that feel. The location is unbelievable - you're on State Street, so you're so close to such great shopping and restaurants. There's a Pinkberry frozen yogurt place practically right outside the front door. Go there! And also, the room service food is great. I highly recommend getting the bacon/egg/avocado breakfast sandwich. It's so good. Staff is really friendly and not really snobby like you might think. Also there's a rooftop bar that becomes quite the hot spot at night. Luckily it didn't make our room too noisy.
