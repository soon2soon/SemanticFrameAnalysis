Awesome!  A definite must-do. We saw all the highlights by Segway on our first trip to Chicago. Paul was THE BEST tour guide!  He even gave us a behind-the-scenes tour of Ed Lake near Soldier Field.  Thanks Paul! For $70 we got a 3 hour tour with lots of fun facts, took some terrific pictures of all the landmarks, and we had a blast doing it. Absolutely terrific value. You have to do this tour.
