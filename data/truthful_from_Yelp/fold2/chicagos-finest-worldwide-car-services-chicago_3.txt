We rented a 7-passenger SUV to transport our wedding party + photographers from hotel to photos to venue. I'm very glad that we went Chicago's Finest -- saved us stress and money! I made the reservation over the phone with Dave, who was helpful and efficient, and he e-mailed me the quote and later follow-ups promptly. A few days before the wedding, I called Dave to change photo locations (North Avenue Beach decided to host its first ever polo tournament...) and timing, and he again sent me an updated quote straight away. Mo was our driver, and he was super professional and friendly. We kept in touch with him via cell phone. And most importantly, he was PUNCTUAL! Yay!
