I just stayed in this hotel for the first time.  It is a newer property having opened in June 2013.  The rooms were clean, nice, and everything was in great shape as you would expect for a new property.  The rate was very  reasonable for downtown Chicago (under $180 night).  You get a nice breakfast in the morning also. I loved the location of this property.  In the River North area and very close to my favorite restaurants (Portillo's and  Lou Malnotti's).  It's a short walk down to Michigan avenue for the shopping. I would recommend this property for a business trip, or a family trip.  This is definitely on my short list the next time I come to Chicago.
