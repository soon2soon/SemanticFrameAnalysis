Currently writing this review while sitting in the hotel lobby so as to remember as much as possible (that and our depature time  is not for another four hours). I stayed at the hotel for four days and three nights with three friends. On our arrival our room wasn't ready but it was fine since we did arrive a bit early. The front desk let us store our bags with them so we could roam around.  They would give me a call when our rooms were ready. We decided to walk around see what was around the hotel. There's a Qdoba, Chipotle, japanese, indian restaurants  and supermarkets all less than a 5 minute walk away, more than that an your choices are endless. About an hour later I received a call from the front desk that our room was ready. The room was a good size and did not seem small for four people. There is wireless and wired internet in the room. The beds were really comfortable and clean. Breakfast is from 6am to 10am and they have hard boiled eggs, cereals, fruits, bagels, donuts, muffins, juices, coffee, tea, oatmeal and a waffle maker. The Magnificent Mile is a block away and there's a bus stop steps away from the hotel entrance that takes you to the Museum Campus (Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum and Adler). Maid service and staff were incredible even with our small requests. I would highly recommend anyone considering a visit to Chicago to stay at this hotel for its price, convenience,  location and friendly staff.
