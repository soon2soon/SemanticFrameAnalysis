This truly is the best hotel to stay at if your visiting Chicago, and even better if you are a local looking for a mini staycation. The staff are always pleasant, from the doorman, to the lady at the check in counter. They are very attentive and you can tell they really love working there. The rooms are amazing! The beds are super comfy and relaxing. They come equipped with Bose speakers connected to the tv so you get great sound, they also have robes and house shoes. My stay last night was absolutely wonderful, I haven't been that relaxed in I don't know how long. The food is amazing, I tried the Korean short ribs and I'm still thinking about them, they were tender and the meat melted in my mouth. The hotel is connected to the mall where they have nordstroms, Boss, and other little shops. It's a great location on the mag mile. The main hotel lobby is very gorgeous, welcoming and luxurious, they really make you feel like royalty here. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
