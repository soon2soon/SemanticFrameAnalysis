The Elysian is #1 for a reason. Everything is elegant with impeccable service and attention to detail. I stayed in an Executive Suite (room 2203). The square footage wasn't huge and the bedroom was only separated from the seating area by a half wall, however the dressing area and huge bathroom more than made up for it. The decor is absolutely stunning -- a symphony of grey's and creams with chandelier accents. The fireplace didn't work but perhaps this was because it's summer? I had a very small balcony (standing room only) with a view of the Hancock building. That was the only window which made the sitting area seem a little dark. The elevators are slow and there are only three of them. Room service was a dream accommodating all of my picky requests but the prices are steep. Housekeeping was fabulous and even went as far as putting tea towels on the bathroom vanity and arranging all of my makeup supplies and brushes for me. The bathroom is really where it's at. The shower is large and luxurious -- big enough for two people to have a lot of good clean fun. The bathtub is marble and very deep...I was able to stretch out and have my shoulders submerged. Asprey provides delightful amenities including shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel, bath salts and lotion in their signature scent. The house car was never available when I needed it which was disappointing -- I had heard there was a fleet of Lexus' (Lexusi?) available but apparently there is only one and you can't reserve it -- it's first come first served. I didn't get a chance to try out the spa unfortunately but I imagine it's on par with the service I experienced as a hotel guest. Overall I felt ensconced in luxury and that's the way it should be. I will definitely return. My favorite hotel in Chicago so far.
