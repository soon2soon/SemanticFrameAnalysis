I never thought that I would be writing an update....but I had to. I had a reservation at another hotel for this upcoming Memorial Day weekend, and I foolishly went to yelp after I made the reservation.....Wrong!! Well after humming and hawing, I went to the website for the Four Points to get an idea of a rate only for it to say...no rooms a available ...very disappointed I called the Hotel asked for a manager and well, I am now staying where I should have in the first place....Four Points Sheraton on Rush....the manager Gomez was amazing and I will never stay anywhere else. Seriously people...this hotel is it....location, staff and staff!! Thank you Four points for be so awesome!!
