I had two stays in Chicago a week apart and stayed at both Embassy Suites locations downtown.    This one was far superior.   First of all it is a better location;    close to the subway and Michigan Avenue.   Secondly the service was much better.   No waiting for anything.   Hotel employees were always available to help with everything without a wait.   The breakfast was the best I have seen at an Embassy Suites anywhere.   Along with the usual, the had an international buffet with breakfast items from many different cultures.   English scones, European Ham, asian selections, etc.    This is definitely the Embassy Suites to choose.   Of course I choose Embassy Suites generally because there are two distinct rooms.   So one person can sleep while one watches TV or whatever.
