Carefree, professional and FUN trolley rental! I rented a 36-person trolley for a group of friends to take down to a sporting event in Evanston, IL. We live in the city, and chartered the trolley to pick us up in River North and drop us off in donwtown Evanston after cruising around Museum Campus and Lake Shore Dr. First off, the scheduling here is a BREEZE: I worked with John Simmons in the scheduling department, and he guided me through the entire process with professionalism and ease! Very responsive, always knew who I was, and had all the details of my reservation readily available. I called various trolley and bus companies trying to find one that would give me a competitive rate and not be impossible to work with. This place always picks up the phone, always answers emails, and knows what's up, and they gave me a very competitive rate (by far the best I could find). Our trolley driver, Rosey, and our day-of experience, were fantastic as well! On the day of our event, Rosey arrived with the trolley about 15 minutes early and allowed us onto the vehicle to drop off some of our belongings and drinks before we were scheduled to take off. He found perfect parking and was very fun and easy to work with! He knew exactly how to hook up our iphone to the music dock, knew all the driving routes, even offered to take us to Museum Campus to take some pictures by the lake. Mid-way through the journey, we needed a restroom stop, and he knew exactly where to take us. Rosey did a phenomenal job, and I would highly recommend him and the Chicago Trolley & Double Decker Co to anyone who wants an easy, professional booking and day-of event experience! Great company all around.
