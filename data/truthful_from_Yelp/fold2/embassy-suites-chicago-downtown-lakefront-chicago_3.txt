I really enjoyed my stay at this really beautiful hotel.   Our room was clean and very nice.   The bed was super soft and the view of the lake and the city was just fantastic.  We were on the twelfth floor which was high enough for a good view.  The managers reception every night was a nice touch and their cooked to order breakfast was just amazing something I have never had in a hotel before.    Our train didn't leave until 5 in the evening and they extended our check out time which I thought was very helpful for us.  Even though there are renovations going on at the hotel it didn't bother us at all.  I hope that when we come back again we will be able to stay here.  The hotel is also close to Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile and lots of restaurants and a grocery store across the street.
