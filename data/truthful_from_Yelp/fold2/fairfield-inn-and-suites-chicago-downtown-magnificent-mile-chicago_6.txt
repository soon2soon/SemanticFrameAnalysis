The minute I walked in the door, I was taken care of.  I have stayed at the Courtyard across the street several times and wanted to try the Fairfield. The front desk associate was friendly and recommended a restaurant near the hotel. It was actually the one I was planning to dine at that evening. The room I had was a suite and felt comfortable.  And the wifi was easy to connect too. The breakfast area is located on the second floor and had many choices.   If you are headed to town for site seeing and shopping, this location is a great spot to stay. Easy walking distance. Make sure you give them a try.
