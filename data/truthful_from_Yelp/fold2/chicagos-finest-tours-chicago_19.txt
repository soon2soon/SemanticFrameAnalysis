My fiance and I discovered this walking tour of Chicago last year through a Groupon deal. I thought "Hey, during a Chicago winter, it's nice to get out, but if it's nasty outside, I don't want to freeze!", so I bought the Groupon and planned a date for us downtown. The guide was REALLY interesting. Dan O'Connell was our tour guide and he was FANTASTIC. I was excited and engaged the entire time. He had a great personality and you could tell her really enjoyed what he was doing. He kept things fun, and taught me things about the city that I had never know before (and I've lived here for 20 years!). I would highly recommend checking out Chicago's Finest River Walk Tours. One nice thing about their pedway tour is that it takes you mostly indoors/underground, so if it's nasty outside (cold, windy, etc.) you stay warm/dry and still get a great tour. We are recommending Chicago's Finest River Walk Tour to all of our friends and family who are coming in for our wedding in April. It's a great way to learn more about Chicago and to get a sneak peek at some of Chicago's hidden treasures in a safe (warm and dry!) environment! They often have Groupon deals. They do book up quickly, so before you buy the Groupon, you might want to check availability for when you are in town.
