I can't say enough about this trolley and double decker bus company. We chose the Chicago over Gray Line because of the YELP reviews, and with good reason. We rarely saw Gray Line trolleys except on the weekend. The Chicago Double Decker buses ran every 15 minutes from about 19 locations. All the major landmarks were included. I purchased our tickets on line for a full week and the first time I boarded I just needed to stop at the kiosk and show them my printed version. They then gave me what I needed to show the driver. After a couple of days it seemed like all the drivers knew us! They waved us on with a big smile and a warm greeting. The guides were funny and informative. Each bringing their own unique story to their passengers. We had a ball! We usually rode up top (September 2014) and were plenty warm/cool. A light jacket was needed in the evening, especially along the water. The lower level was enclosed and fairly accessible if the weather turns bad. I stayed in the loop because there was plenty to do but I'd like to do the various neighborhoods that were included in our pass when we go back again. THIS is the trolley/double decker bus company you need to use. We loved it.
