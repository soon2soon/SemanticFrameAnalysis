CRE rocks. They arranged our honeymoon a month before and put us in three top notch locations and casitas. Details we never though of were covered and the cost wasn't much more than if we had reserved the trip ourselves. Loved the trip, love CRE. Makes me jones for the good old days of travel agents once again!
