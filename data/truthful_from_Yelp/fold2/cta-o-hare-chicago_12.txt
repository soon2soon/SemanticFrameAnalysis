This is definitely one of the cleanest CTA stations around that I have visited. It's also nice that they definitely make this a bit more conducive to travelers given the fact that the gates are a bit wider and more accomodating for those who need to carry larger suitcases through. Simply an easy way to get to the airport. It's a bit of a walk the station itself to the check in, but they've got plenty of moving walkways and it's pretty easy enough. Definitely an easy enough tasks for most. Great way to beat the traffic back to the city as well depending on when you get in!
