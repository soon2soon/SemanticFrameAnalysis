Couldn't have asked for a better company to help plan a vacation to Costa Rica for my parents 35th anniversary.  We wanted to get away for a little fun in the sun, but needed help coming up with activities that would keep the interest of three generations.  Aaron was a true joy to work with, he took a genuine interest in the occasion - was patient and helpful every step of the way - never making me feel like I was asking to many questions or changing my mind to often :) .  Our trip was perfect from the time we stepped on the plane until the time we returned.  He organized the great excursions ranging from horseback riding to a deep sea fishing trip - he also made some fabulous dining recommendations, and booked the most unbelievable hotels - all while staying within my budget.  Thank you Aaron and Costa Rica Experts, you have a customer for life!
