We spent almost one week at this hotel with my husband and my baby. The hotel is great and I definitely recommend to stay there. The location is perfect, walking distance of Michigan Av., the Loop, Millenium Park and all the major tourist parts of Chicago! The hotel is almost brand new, very very clean, our room was huge. They have the best staff ever working there. Everyone was so nice!!! Javier and Fany from the breakfast room and Stephanie from front desk are the nicest person ever!!! We really had a great time and would stay there next time we are in Chicago. We also stayed one night at the Double Tree and OMG.. We were so disappointed by the double tree. The Fairfield inn is ten thousand times better!!!
