Exceptional 5-Star Luxury Hotel. "RANKED #1 in Chicago on tripadvisor.com" (Travelers' Choice® 2011 Winner) I stayed here with my family from Nov. 25-27, 2011.  We got a two-bedroom suite, and we enjoyed our entire stay experience here. They have two great restaurants to choose from, Balsan and Ria (2 Michelan Stars). Ate only at Balsan, and the food here is expensive with small portions, but worth the price!!! Overall, they have a very friendly staff and the hotel has a very contemporary, sophisticated theme to all their rooms, and they have a beautiful hotel lobby ( which is small, yet, one of the most unique I have seen in a while). Only one major con: Don't expect great views of Chicago at this hotel, however it is steps away from all the major shops on the Magnificent Mile. ***Just learned today, this hotel will be renamed: Waldorf Astoria Chicago on February 1, 2012.
