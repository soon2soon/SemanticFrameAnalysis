I had some friends visiting from the St. Louis area this weekend and we decided to take the Loop tour. It was an excellent tour, the guide was easy to locate at our meeting spot and even provided us with his contact info when we signed-up in case we needed to reach him. I feel that this tour was better than some of the bus tours because you actually walk to, and spend some time at, the landmarks that the guide discusses. This was an afternoon tour and it went so well that my friends and I decided to sign-up for another tour by this company that same evening. The Michigan Ave and Navy Pier tour was also a hit! It began at 830pm and ended at Navy Pier just in time for us to get a quick snack before the fireworks started. I will recommend these tours to everyone now! You get to decide how much the tour is worth, so be sure to 'tip' as you see fit at the end of the tour.
