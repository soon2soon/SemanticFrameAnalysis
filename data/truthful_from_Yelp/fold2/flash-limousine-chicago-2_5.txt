I used Flash Limousine a few weeks ago for a short trip after a concert at the House of Blues in Chicago. Setting up the trip was easy and painless, even though it was last minute. The driver made sure to make contact me the night of our ride to let me know exactly where he was parked (which was right out front). We were able to connect with him easily, even through the chaos of the crowd after the concert. The car was shiny and immaculate. The driver was professional, opening our doors and the such. Although it was just a short trip, we had a great time. Thanks Flash for making our random night of fun a bit more classy. Nothing like pulling up in Wriglyville in a Limo.
