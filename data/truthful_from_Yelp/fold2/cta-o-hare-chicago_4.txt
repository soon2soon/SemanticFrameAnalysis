The fastest and easiest way to O'Hare or to Downtown Chicago!!! This is the end of the line so you won't have to worry about missing the airport.  When the train stops you just get off and head up the stairs.  At the top you go left for Terminal 3, straight for Terminal 2 and right for Terminal 1...if your heading to Terminal 5...you need to walk to any terminal and grab another train to that location. The train gets you into the airport...the walk is not very far. Plus AT&T has 3G and cell service down here too!!! One positive for my phone!!! I highly recommend if you have a longer layover at O'Hare, then this is a great way to get out and explore the city. If you are riding into the city, do not get off at stop that says "Chicago"...it is the name of a street. There is a great view of the skyline from Chicago Avenue but you want to farther in.  Get off the train at anywhere between Clark/Lake and Jackson and you will be in the heart of the city!!! So don't let that long delay get you down. Get out $2.25 and see the city.  You will be glad you did!!!
