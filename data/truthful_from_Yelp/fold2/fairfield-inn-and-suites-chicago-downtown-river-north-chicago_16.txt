Beautiful place to stay!!  I recently used my Marriott Rewards points to stay here and im glad I did.  The hotel is quite new and right in the heart of downtown Chicago.  The rates are reasonable and the location cant be beat.   Why I think this place deserves 5 stars is the staff.  It's so refreshing to walk into a place and have the entire staff greet you with a smile.  Upon my arrival the night manager introduced himself and notified me that my room has been upgraded for free.  Earlier in the day I called to notify the front desk that my flight was cancelled and I was being re-routed through Vegas which would force me to check in late at night.  Knowing this, the staff upgraded my room and allowed me to pick out a free alcoholic beverage and made me a personal pizza on the house.  Right away I felt at ease and they helped my stay be so enjoyable. Please keep in mind the parking which is the only negative thing I have to mention.  However, you are in downtown Chicago so this shouldn't come as a surprise.  Valet is $65 a day and self-park is $45 a day.  The self-parking lot is a few blocks down so be prepared for a 3-4 minute walk.   Overall, love the hotel and staff.  Thank you
