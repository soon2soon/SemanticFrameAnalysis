I cannot speak highly enough of my stay with Fairfield Inn & Suites at 216 E. Ontario, particularly of the night auditor Darcel and security staff William.  Please stay here. In summary: after an unfortunate customer service situation at our hostel (Hostelling International Chicago) forced us to find alternate accommodations within half an hour at 1:30 in the morning, leading to a frantic phone call to Fairfield Inn, they were kind enough to offer my friend and me a heavily discounted double room.  From the moment we left our taxi until check-out, we experienced nothing but warmth, good humor and helpfulness from the staff.  William had met us at our taxi on arrival, and after confirming that we were "the two girls who got kicked out of the hostel", he kindly escorted us to the front desk where the charming Darcel first assisted us.  The lobby and our 14th-floor room were sleek and beautiful.  The continental, complimentary breakfast was extensive.  The beds were like unicorn breaths and we slept like boulders. Thank you, Fairfield Inn.
