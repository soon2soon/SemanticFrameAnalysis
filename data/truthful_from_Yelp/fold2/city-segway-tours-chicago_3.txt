They see me rollinnn, they hatinnn.... Decided to be a tourist in my own city last weekend, and if you're going to be a tourist, you might as well get a segway.  Go big or go home. Word of mouth told me that City Segway was the best tour company in the city, so I decided to book with them.  I had heard great things about one of their tour guides, Clark, and wanted to book a tour with him.  Unfortunately, he was not available the day I went. It ended up being a blessing in disguise as I was sent on a tour with Tammie, who ended up being an awesome tour guide.  She was so knowledgable about Chicago, that I was shocked to hear she was originally from Tennessee.  I was even more shocked that a Tennessee girl was using a segway...I thought the only wheels women used in Tennessee involved double wide trailers and baby strollers ;). All in all, it was a great experience.  The segways were a little awkward at first, but became very natural as the tour went on, and they sure beat the hell out of walking. The ages in our group ranged from people in their 20s to people in their 60s, so anyone can pick it up.   I also learned a lot of fun facts about Chicago that I didn't know before in my 13 mile (crazy) trek around Grant Park and the museum campus.   I would definitely recommend City Segway for any out of towners or anyone wanting to be a tourist for the day!
