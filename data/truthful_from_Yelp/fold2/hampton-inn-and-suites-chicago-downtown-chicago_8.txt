There is no better feeling than leaving a hotel knowing (as well as remembering) the names of those who helped make your stay that much more enjoyable. Tracy, Ronnie and Janita were by far, the best front desk employees I have ever come across in my travels. They are extremely knowledgeable about the area, gave great places to see, eat and visit, and just made the stay at this hotel fabulous! This is how great they were - when we were at the front desk, guest leaving would stop by and thank them for their invaluable service. Now that is what customer service should be about! About the hotel: I would say the rooms are typical. Nothing really stood out about them. The continental breakfast buffet was cool, but I was longing for bacon, which never happened. This hotel is only 3 blocks from Michigan Ave., and the stop for the free Navy Pier trolley is a block or two away. The post office is right around the corner and it's well within walking distance to great eats. The main negative would be it's located across the street from a fire station; however, the hotel provides ear plugs in the lobby. Overall, will definitely stay at this hotel on my next visit to Chicago!
