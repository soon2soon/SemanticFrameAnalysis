What a great little gem in downtown Chicago.  Stayed here for a night on business.  Check in is fully automated, getting you to your room quickly.  Staff are incredibly friendly and there to help. Each floor has a special filtered spring water machine with bottles that you can take.  Rooms are a tad small, but acceptable given the room rates and location. There is a great pub in the lobby for a drink and burger after a long day.  I would stay here again.
