If you're looking for an inexpensive downtown hotel, you have to stay here.   I was able to check in early (Thank you SO much!). The bed & pillows were super plush and heavenly.  I slept wonderfully.  And it was very quiet, even on the weekend!   Free WIFI! Close to super tasty doughnut places & a million wonderful restaurants. I'd definitely stay here again.
