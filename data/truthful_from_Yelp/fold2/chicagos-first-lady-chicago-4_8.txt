I was in Chicago for business, and I found myself with a few hours to spare. I've been to the Shedd aquarium and planetarium and a few museums before, Â but I'd never done one of these cruises, so I decided to give it a try. Truly money well spent. It was one of those weird July days that doesn't get above 70, so I was a little chilly from the constant breeze on the water, but the sun was out, so no big deal! I took the 1:30 cruise on a regular (not holiday) Monday, and it wasn't even close to full. Our volunteer's name was Pete, and he was, in a word, phenomenal. I know very little about architecture, and the thought of it doesn't make my socks go up and down. But Pete made it so interesting that I didn't even want to go down and get a drink from bartender Lauren for fear I would miss something. I learned so much, and I took a deeper look at the buildings that I normally wouldn't have. For visitors who are on the metric system, Pete also gave distance units in meters and area units in square meters. Truly a nice touch so everyone can get the scale of things. Pete wouldn't accept tips. He said in lieu of tips, he'd like us to go out and spend copious amounts of money in the great city of Chicago. 10-4, good buddy.
