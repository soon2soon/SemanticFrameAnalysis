These folks handle the process of getting visas via the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, as is required for folks who live in the upper midWest and who cannot conveniently handle the process in person.   I and my wife are travelling to China in July, me on business and she to accompany me as a tourist.  I got an invitation letter from the organization with whom I am meeting, and she applied for a tourist visa.  For reasons I don't understand, my visa was approved and hers was refused.   The staff at the Visa Center went way out of its way to work with me in developing and providing additional information to meet the Consulate's concerns.  It took a lot of time and effort on both our parts.  Ultimately, they were successful and my wife's visa application was approved..  They did not charge extra for this extra service.  The Visa Service Center Staff was most efficient and did an excellent job of keeping me up to date as events transpired. Kudos to them.
