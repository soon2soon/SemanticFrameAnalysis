We stayed here for the chicago triathlon and it was a great choice. The hotel was very well kept, and GREAT service. The rooms had everything you needed (small really does mean small) which we had no issues with since there was only two of us. For a family u may need a bigger room. The room has a nice tv, nice desk . Also free water service which we thought was very cool. For a night in the city and for the pricing this hotel is a great choice a must stay and def will be back.
