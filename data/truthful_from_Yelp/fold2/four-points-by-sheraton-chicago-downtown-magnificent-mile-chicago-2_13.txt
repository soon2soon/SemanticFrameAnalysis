We were able to a get a decent price for this hotel although it was the weekend of the Chicago Marathon. The staff is friendly and attentive and even briefed us on close convenient stores and restaurants. There was not one time walked past a staff member where we weren't greeted. Can't beat the location of this place. Don't expect the the Hyatt, as you didn't pay for it. Everything is classy, comfy and clean although I mysteriously woke up with a french fry in my bed after a night of drinking...?
