Very much enjoyed the Pedway Tour I did with this company. Dan led the tour, and he was very engaging and had lots of knowledge to share about the history of Chicago and the sights we were seeing.  I learned some new things that I hadn't learned on several previous tours around Chicago. This tour involves a LOT of walking, but I actually preferred this, as I was a bit worried this would be a quickie tour with not much to see. I was pleasantly surprised. We did do a few above-ground sights, including the Chicago Cultural Center and Macy's on State, but I didn't think this took anything away from the tour.  You do venture above-ground to go into the lobbies and hallways of various buildings (e.g., hotels, office buildings) to get from Pedway entrance to Pedway entrance. I have since found a lot of cool Pedway areas we did not explore on the tour, but this would've been an all-day tour to see it all. The areas we did explore were clean, well-lit and safe, so if that's your concern, don't worry. If anything, you may come away hungry because you pass by so many wonderful-smelling restaurants. Pack your walking shoes and enjoy the tour!
