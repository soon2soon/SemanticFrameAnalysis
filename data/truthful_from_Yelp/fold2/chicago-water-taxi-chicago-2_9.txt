This is a super cheap alternative to seeing Chicago by boat- $5 in comparison to the $20 architectural boat tour! Would definitely recommend! We took it from the navy pier to right in front of the trump towers, and it was a perfect way to snap pix of the gorgeous city skyline against the river and travel easily and efficiently.
