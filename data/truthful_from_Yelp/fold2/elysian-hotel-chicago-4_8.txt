Went on a Monday afternoon for a 60 minute massage & lunch. Indulgent. Tranquil. Therapeutic. Sauna. Steam. Whirlpool. Rain shower. A must go. lunch at balsam was tasteful French cuisine. Service at both places was perfect.  Its very classy and elegant but not pretentious.  Will go again. A very memorable experience. Now the Waldorf Astoria...quality still remains great (as of 5/7/12)
