I have heard about the architectural tours but I didn't want to have to schedule something or shell out $30, so I convinced my friend to take me to Chinatown to hop on the Chicago Water Taxi.  Perfect!  You can find the docking area close to the pagoda's in Ping Tom Park. From there you pay $4 or $6 cash (roundtrip) and you basically travel along the river to the Mag Mile and back.  In fact, if I had more time I would have gone back and forth a few times.  We took the train to Chinatown, the taxi to Mag Mile and found another train back to the 'burbs.  It was a beautiful night and an awesome way to see the city.  You don't get the 'tour' per say but if you don't want to know about the buildings, this is a cheap must do for the frugal tourist.  My friend is from Chicago and had never done it and he was giggling like a school boy he was so excited! Just do it. ;)
