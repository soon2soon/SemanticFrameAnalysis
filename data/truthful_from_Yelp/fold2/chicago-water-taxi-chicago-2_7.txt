what took me so long to water taxi?  there's no excuses anymore.  it needed to be crossed off my chicago bucket list.  for just $3 you can get to the mag mile or chinatown.  that's cheaper than a taxi & a hell of a better ride.  they blast 80's rock, the energy is upbeat & the boats are surprisingly un-crowded!  if you buy a card for 10 rides, it's like half off!   now i'm ready for my long-overdue architecture tour!  chicago basically rocks.
