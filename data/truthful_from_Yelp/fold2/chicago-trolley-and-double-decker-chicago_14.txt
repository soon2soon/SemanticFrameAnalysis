Great time, funny knowledgeable tour guides.  Nice route and great option to hop on an off. They need to remove the decorative people cutouts strapped onto the side of the open air upper deck level.  EVERYONE would move around after a while to find a place those damn things would not be in their view.  GET RID OF THEM.  Obvious blunder to put them on.
