A group of friends and I rented a house from Gameday Housing for the New Year's holiday.  While they typically rent for Michigan football games, Geoff was more than happy to check with their clients to see if anyone would be interested in renting to us for the holiday.  Geoff was able to help us find a beautiful house near the stadium that was perfect for our group's needs.  Gameday Housing was very courteous and professional, and we highly recommend them for your search in vacation rentals in Ann Arbor, MI.
