As a DePaul University alum, I have seen the endless project that the Fullerton Station had become.  I lost count on how many months the renovation took but I am truly happy to see that it's finally complete.  First off, they kept the original station house on the north-side of Fullerton (for those who can remember, next to the now non-existent Demon Dogs).  The entrance is plenty spacious--as it should be for being the station used by the most CTA riders city-wide!  I am pleased that they finally installed the Train Tracker estimated train arrival screens--even though they should have not been those lame tickers with multiple mini-lights that die out quickly.  Hello!  LED lights or flat screen TVs like the many of the other stations throughout the city would have been better.  Also the credit card machines to purchase multi-use pases is a plus.  I am still trying to decide if this station was really worth tearing down the historic Hayes-Healy Gymnasium on Wish Field, but who am I to say?!  At least now we can see the soccer players practice while awaiting the next train...
