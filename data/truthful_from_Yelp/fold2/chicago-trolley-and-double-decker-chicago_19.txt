We used this company for our wedding and were very pleased with the service.  We booked 2 different services, one for earlier in the day to do pictures and one for later in the night to transport guests to hotels.  The driver was prompt both times - the trolleys were clean and heated well.  The company was very easy to communicate with and the pricing was clear and reasonable after comparing to other companies.  I would recommend using this company for any wedding transportation needs!
