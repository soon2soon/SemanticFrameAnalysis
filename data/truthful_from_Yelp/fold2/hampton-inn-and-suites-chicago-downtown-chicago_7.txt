Hands down this is one of the best hotels in Chicago!!  The staff is great and very accommodating, the rooms are spacious and very clean, there is free WI-FI, the breakfast in the morning is great and has many options, and there is also a pool and gym that is free to use.  We stay at this hotel every time we are in Chicago.  I have stayed at numerous other "high dollar" hotels in the downtown Chicago area and you don't get a fraction of what you get at this more reasonably priced hotel.  I know people comment about the fire station being next door and being noisy but it is really no different than any of the the other traffic noise that is typical of the downtown area.  I recommend this hotel to all of my friends who also visit the downtown area on a regular basis and they have also had the same experience.  You really can't beat the awesome suites that they have, especially if you are traveling with kids. The kitchen has a full size fridge, microwave, and stove top. This is great if you are staying for several nights/days. The valet parking is also very  good. We have never had any problems and we have a large SUV.  The hotel is close to all the hotspots including the magnificent mile and awesome restaurants.  I just brought my kids here this week for a fun downtown experience and my husband and I will be returning next week for the hockey game.  love this place!
