My brother and I did the loop tour with Mel and absolutely loved it!! She was especially knowledgable about theater things, which was interesting. We maybe would have liked more about the great fire - but the other history we did learn was excellent! Mel was especially helpful in giving personalized information for group members about other things to see and do and eat. Not just in the city, which she was very knowledgable about, but also our continuing road trip. Also, she has wonderful hair and is very funny!! Although, I think perhaps we have the same sense of humor as her because other people didn't seem to laugh as much as us. Overall, it was a great way to start out our sightseeing and help us get our bearings in the city. And to inspire my brother to become a tour guide...
