Well, this may be a review of a different sort. You see, I actually didn't stay at the hotel. I booked a room at this hotel via Priceline. My flight was canceled, which did not allow me to get in to utilize this reservation on time. I was very nervous about how this would work out, and called Priceline only to be told they couldn't do anything for me unless I called the hotel. Â I called the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised by the customer service. The person that I talked to you, actually looked up my flight online, and while It did not give her the information I needed it too, she offered to cancel my reservation, with a one night hotel stay fee. Granted, it was already 7:30 PM by this time. All I needed to do, was call Priceline back, and confirm this with them. She would then call Priceline, and confirm on her end. She even let me know, that she was a little bit busy with people in line, but that I had her commitment that she would call within the next 30 minutes. Low and behold, I had Priceline calling me, to follow up with me that the hotel had called and I would be refunded for the additional nights. This was an unbelievably positive experience in my book. I will be more apt to use this hotel in the future. Given it's location, and great reviews, I will be sure to make sure that I give this hotel business in the future. Kudos to you Doubletree! Thanks for making what could have been a poor experience, a great one!
