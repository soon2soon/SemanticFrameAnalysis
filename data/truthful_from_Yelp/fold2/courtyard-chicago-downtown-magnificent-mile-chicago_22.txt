I am VERY PLEASED with this hotel.  I can express how great it was staying and working with this hotel.   Here are a few reasons why I will definitely go back to this hotel. 1) Location.  Just a block away from Michigan Ave. and right next door to Garrett's Popcorn! 2) Staff.  Excellent and always willing to help.  The bell hop with up to our room within 5 minutes of calling.  They held our packages (about 6 of them) and always informed me right when they arrived.  Our banquet caterer was excellent also.  So if you need to have meeting space, this place is very convenient.  The meeting rooms are downstairs and away from hotel traffic.  Sales and catering staff are also wonderful!  They went out of their way to make everything for our group seamless.  I did not have any problems at all. 3) Gym and Pool.  I visited 2 higher end hotels in Chicago and they did not have a pool.  This one is a good size and free! 4) Really good catering menu.  Our board members and staff loved it. 5) Bar and restaurant attached to hotel.  Just in case you need a quick drink. 6) BIG rooms.  I had the double queen room and it was bigger than my apartment! 7) Paul Mitchell amenities.  Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Lotion.  Good size for the avid traveler. I think I've made my point clear.
