UPDATE** Yelp is a powerful tool and I appreciate businesses that take notice of their customers. We were contacted shortly after my review posted by Andrew, a manager of the dispatch team who was incredibly understanding and willing to listen to both sides of the story. He took time out of his day to reach out and call to better understand. After explaining the situation he immediately understood why we were frustrated. Not only did Andrew offer to reimburse us the $30 in additional charges he also offered us a complimentary ride in the future. (We would have been thrilled with just the $30) This was completely unexpected and also unnecessary. It speaks volumes when a company cares enough to reach out and do something about it. So kudos to Andrew and the Echo Limo team for being astute and listening to customers. We sincerely appreciate your willingness to go above and beyond and look forward to telling this story to family and friends. Also, Steve, the driver we had over this past weekend was AWESOME! He was on time, personable and a lot of fun to be with. THANK YOU again for listening and being a proactive business. It goes a VERY LONG way. Cheers!
