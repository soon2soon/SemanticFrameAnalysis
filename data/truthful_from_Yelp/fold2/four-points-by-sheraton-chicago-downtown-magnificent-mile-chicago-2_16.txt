I will stay here whenever I go back to Chicago. Besides a little mix-up with the reservation (which resulted in us getting our parking fees comped), the service was great - the woman at the front desk succumbing to my subtle charms (see above about the parking fees being comped), and the porter was friendly upon arrival, made our arrival pleasant and trouble free. The room was clean, bathroom large, and coffee & water bottles complimentary. With the weather in Chicago being a brisk 36 degrees, it was comforting to walk into a room that was perfectly warmed to 74 degrees, all without the annoying humming of a cheap wall mounted heater/cooler. For all you health nuts who dread traveling beyond the Bay, fearing that you'll be removed from access to organic food outlets, you'll explode when you realize that attached to this hotel is none other than......Trader Joe's! I realized, on that day, that TJ's doesn't Â carry canned whip cream, so we had to compromise, and chose to use tapioca pudding for our "freaky time" instead. Just, not the same.... Did I mention that this hotel is close to everything?!
