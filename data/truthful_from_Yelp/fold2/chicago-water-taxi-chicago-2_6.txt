This is a neat and Inexpensive way to see the views of Chicago. If you want to see the magnificent sights and do not want to pay for a cruise, taking the water taxi is a great option. The water taxi can take you anywhere to and from Union Station, Magnificent Mile (Michigan Avenue), Chinatown. You are allowed to stand and just hang out by the deck too instead of sitting.
