Wonderful and comfortable beds. Like sleeping on a cloud, that is, if my assumption of what it would be like to sleep on a cloud is accurate. Bob Costas was getting off the elevator as I was getting on. Photo booth right when you walk in the door. Vacant hot tub/pool on several occasions. Beautiful.
