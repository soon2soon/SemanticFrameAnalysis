Best day ever..... relaxing, got to Chinatown.   We got the all day pass which was worth it, we were on all day.  If you are going to Chinatown to check it out, you have to get on/off at the Ogilvie/Union Station stop (go South to Chinatown).    It runs on a timetable so keep an eye on the clock when you are returning from Chinatown....we loved it - very worth it.
