I did the International BBQ tour yesterday and LOVED IT! What a great way to see the city and try some amazing foods! Dimitra and Sharon could not have been nicer... they were very engaging and just really cool chicks. They not only knew a lot about the places we visited and the types of foods we tried, but would point out places along the way to check out, which was cool (I love a good recommendation). We were also able to go back into the kitchens at a few of the places to check out how they were BBQ-ing our food (never seen a clay oven before!). And the food was AMAZING... they warned us at the beginning to pace ourselves on the eating, but I completely gorged at every stop and it was so worth it (and we were biking, so I didn't feel guilty...) I've been in Chicago several years now and this was definitely something different and fun that I really enjoyed. Dimitra and Sharon have a great thing going and were discussing all of the ideas they have for upcoming tours, so I would totally recommend this experience to anyone who loves food and is just looking for something unique and fun!
