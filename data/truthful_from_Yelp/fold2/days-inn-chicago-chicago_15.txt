The room and bathroom were a good size.  We were on the second floor so we could hear the traffic noise but they provided two sets of ear plugs for our use.  Honestly, we didn't need them.  After a night of fun we were so tired that if there was any traffic noise we didn't hear it.  We did have a slight issue with room and they took care of it promptly and to our satisfaction.   We will stay here again.
