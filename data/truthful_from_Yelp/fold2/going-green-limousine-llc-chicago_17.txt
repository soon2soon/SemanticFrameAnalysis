I used Going Green Limo on my recent trip to Chicago to get my mom, 9-month-old, & myself from the airport (O'Hare) to our hotel downtown. They were prompt, courteous, & helpful. We especially loved Max! He was very personable. We brought our own car seat but I think next time we will use theirs to save the hassle. I was a bit put off at first that gratuity was included in the charge upfront but realized that it saved the hassle of fumbling for money when my hands were already full & they were totally worth it.
