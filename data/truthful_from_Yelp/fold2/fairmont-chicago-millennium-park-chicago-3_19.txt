We stayed in one of the "gold rooms" on the 15th floor.  The room was beautiful, and it was really convenient to be on the same floor as the lounge.  Plenty of free, non-alcoholic beverages to choose from as well as a cash honor bar, and delicious snacks.  The breakfast buffet was also excellent.  The service was outstanding, and I loved the layout of the rooms.  Will definitely go back!
