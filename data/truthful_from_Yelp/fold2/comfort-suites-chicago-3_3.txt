Best hotel I have ever stayed in. Friendly flexible staff, huge rooms with kitchens and laundry built right in. We had six people in a queen double and it was still very open and livable. Breakfast was offered in the morning and the wifi was fast. Every time I called the front desk for a cab we had one within ten minutes. I would love to come back and visit!
