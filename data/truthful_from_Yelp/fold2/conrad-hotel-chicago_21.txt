My experience at the Conrad was great. The location is unbeatable and they have all the amenities you could want. After going for a friend's birthday in the city, the hotel was very accommodating to our 20-person, loud, and fairly demanding group. The beds were heavenly, the bathrooms were clean and beautiful, and the turn down service was excellent. You can tell the hotel is modern and up to date, which goes a long way in my book.
