Wow.  That's all I can say.  Just recently I have started taking Metra while commuting to and from work.  Having come from years of riding CTA/Pace only, I was taken aback the first time on a Metra train.  The hours I work are overnights, so the trains obviously are never overcrowded, and the fact that I can actually stretch out on the seat and take a nap is the best perk of them all.  I can be found taking the BNSF line, and only once in the last two months have the trains been running behind  (and it was only ten minutes late).  The fares are reasonable ($3.60 from Downer's Grove to Union Station) and you have many options for rides, like a 10-ride ticket, or a monthly pass for only $120.  All in all, I'm glad I have the option to take Metra, and would suggest it to anyone trying to ease a commute.
