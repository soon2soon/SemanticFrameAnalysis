Great hotel!  The rooms are almost too quiet during the night.  My only complaint would be the tiny showers.  The rain shower itself was fabulous, but leg shaving is almost impossible without feeling like you are going to drown.  The staff was fantastic and the rooms were very clean.  The best part---it's steps from Bloomingdales!!!
