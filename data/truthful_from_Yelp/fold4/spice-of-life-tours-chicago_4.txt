The Spice of Life Tour with Ali was wonderful! Great antidotes about the area, interesting history, and amazing food! I've lived in Chicago for 10 years and I was pleasantly surprised by how much new historical and cultural stories I learned. Spice of Life Tours also takes you to the very best restaurants on Devon Ave (Little India), allowing you to sample cuisines from all areas of India! Come hungry!!! Ali arranged for the food to be warm and fresh at every stop!! I am hard pressed to think of a better way to spend an afternoon in Chicago. We enjoyed trying on Sarees, we all received henna, played traditional Indian games a and even visited a sheikh Â temple!! How amazing is that!! Ali was an excellent tour guide who kept us intrigued and well-fed. I highly recommend this tour. It's well worth the cost and time! You'll be suggesting it to your friends for years to come.
