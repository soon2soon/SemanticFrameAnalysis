We were in town for the America's Beauty Show at McCormick and stayed overnight at the Majestic.  As soon as we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the enthusiastic bellman.  Upon check-in we received amazing customer service: they gave us great information about restaurants, directions, and other helpful suggestions to make our stay in Chicago perfect.  We loved the DVR in the room, and, for a boutique hotel, the room definitely met my "O.C.D." standards!  The lobby area had a little nook with a fireplace, books, and cookies.  We wished we had more time to enjoy that area.  In the morning, we were pleasantly surprised to find DanActive probiotic yogurt at the complimentary breakfast buffet.  (A nice touch for travelers!)  When we left, the super-courteous staff gave us a friendly farewell and ordered a cab for us.  We will stay at the Majestic every time we come to Chicago!
