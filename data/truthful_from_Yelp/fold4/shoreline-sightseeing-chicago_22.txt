The architecture boat tour lived up to the hype. I expected to be disappointed. I was worried about taking the boat tour at night because it was cheaper and I may miss seeing the buildings. Seventy-five minutes later I was grateful I took the boat tour, took it at night, and knew the language of Chicago architecture. The city was beautiful at dusk and even more stunning at night. I can't recommend this highly enough for anyone visiting Chicago.
