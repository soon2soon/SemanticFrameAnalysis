When I first got into the cab, I thought - is this really happening?  Am I hallucinating from too much bourbon? By the time I got home, I was amused, reassured, and had his song stuck in my head.  He even asked if i wanted to audition for his band (they're looking for a guitarist; I politely declined). Your odds for finding Ray St. Ray seem to be best if you are leaving a Lincoln Square bar after 11pm on a weekend.  If i remember, the cab was white and slightly cleaner than the average cab.
