Wow, what a GREAT hotel!! Great amenities, friendly staff, great honor bar and walking distance to Wrigley field. Comfortable beds, large rooms and inexpensive parking, $22. Speaking of inexpensive, this is the first hotel that has a reasonably priced honor bar. $1 for snacks, $2.50 for beers. Awesome!
