I would definitely stay at this hotel again!  Before arriving, I spoke with Daniel Matthews who went above and beyond to help put our itinerary together, which set the tone for our enjoyable stay.  Upon arrival, I was not disappointed. Everyone who worked there was wonderful but most impressive were the doormen who we saw the most coming and going.  Always smiling, very friendly and courteous. Rooms were clean & comfortable, excellent location.  There's just too many great things about this hotel to mention. Do wish they were selling the pillow they have in each room lol ;)
