If you want a central location in downtown I don't know of a better place.  If you want to be near Prentice Woman's Hospital for the birth of your grandson you cannot get any closer.   The staff was so nice, helpful, and attentive.  From the valet parking to the maids everything is top notch.   MileNorth is very quirky in its' rooms decorations.  You will get the idea if you just walk into the lobby and see an old Royal typewriter.  The vibe you get goes throughout the whole hotel.
