Let me start off by saying that I'm a committed Starwood and Intercontinental double-Platinum traveler, and I was not planning on staying here, but with this booking out of my hands, I had to go with where the team was staying.   This team obviously knew what they were doing, as the Omni Chicago was an exceptional experience. First things first - if you're going to stay here, go to Omni's website and register for their Select Guest program.  It costs nothing, and their Gold (lowest-level, 0-stay required) tier offers guests benefits you don't see at other chains until you stay dozens of nights in a year - if they are even offered.  2 clothing items pressed, shoes shined, complimentary in-room water and morning beverages (coffee and Red Bull, please!), as well as complimentary WiFi.   The hotel is perfectly located central to business and shopping destinations in Chicago, and has a charming lobby and bar area of old dark wood.  Valets were on-point for parking and baggage assistance, and the suite's appointments a very welcome surprise.  Spacious and comfortable office area, and a sumptuous bed and bedroom.  The bathroom was a treat, with bath salts perfect for a long soak.   The staff really made it work, though.  I took advantage of the pressing and shoe-shine, and everything was fast and efficient.  Check-out was a snap, and I have to say that I missed the old-school feel when I checked-in to the W Lakeshore the next night.
