This is a fantastic experience, and one I would repeat.  I did my ride via Groupon, called before the expiration date and they honored the Groupon even though the ride itself couldn't be scheduled until after the expiration date.  Always clear communication in scheduling, including a reminder call.  They were courteous, professional, laid-back, and the ride itself is a must-do.  I would highly recommend a night flight.  Easy reservation process.  Went off without a hitch.
