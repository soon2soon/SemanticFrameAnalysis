My wife and I have stayed in numerous hotels in the same neighborhood throughout the years.  We have never been as impressed as we were this weekend.  The service we received from all of the employees was excellent.  The quality and the cleanliness of the entire hotel was outstanding. We stay in Chicago several times a year.  We have now found our go-to hotel.
