Wicker Park Went on the Wicker Park tour with my husband and we had a fantastic time!  I want to do the River North one next! Our guide Alyssa was terrific.  She was enthusiastic and well informed.  The tour company does a nice job of providing a very broad tour - different types of foods, yet still typically Chicago. We had a lovely sunny day, yet the crispness of fall just sneaking itself in. First stop was donuts which was perfect since we hadn't eaten any breakfast in anticipation of the day.  Yummy.  Then Chicago deep dish, of course!  Wouldn't be Chicago without a dog....both the real ones we saw all over Wicker Park and those kosher ones with savory toppings.  Chicken, tacos and dessert rounded out the tour. A reasonable amount of information about the architecture and  neighborhood  personality was sprinkled in.  In general a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
