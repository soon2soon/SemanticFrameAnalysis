Magic. First and foremost, special thank you to Corinna Weeks, a top-notch employee there. Corinna- you are amazing and thank you for being so helpful. The quiet and spacious rooms, the attentive and friendly staff, the endless amenities, and finally the low-key but super high-end pool/spa, all make for an unforgettable stay and experience. Kudos to you, Park Hyatt Chicago- I like you more than the four seasons (not that it's a contest). PHC I love you. Keep up the awesome work! Dave
