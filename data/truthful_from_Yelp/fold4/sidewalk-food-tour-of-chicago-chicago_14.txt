I went on the Wicker Park tour a few weeks back on a sunny Sunday afternoon. I grew up in the Chicago area and now live in Detroit. I knew of some of these food places growing up in Chicago but it was great to finally visit them in one tour! The tour lasts for 3 hours and ended right on time. There was enough time in between walking from restaurant to restaurant to actually relax and enjoy the food. It's a fun way to explore the neighborhood on foot all the while eating yummy Chicago food! Our tour leader Jake is a funny guy and really knew his stuff. He made the tour enjoyable and the three hours flew by really fast. The restaurants were also very accommodating and provided us with reserved tables to sit down and water. Drinks can be purchased on your own at most of the places. In all I really enjoyed the tour and I would definitely try to do the River North tour when I return to the city!
