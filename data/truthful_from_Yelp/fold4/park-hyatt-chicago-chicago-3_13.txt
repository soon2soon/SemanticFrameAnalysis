Check out my photos. This place is nice and comfortable. They've thought of everything for you. Down to the toothpaste and brush inside of room. My favorite part is they have FULL LENGTH MIRRORS!! I wish other hotels pay attention to the Park Hyatt. They know what we want. Warm friendly service also. Not sure about prices but it seems to look like they're expensive. But well worth it. TV in bathroom, spacious bathroom, even have a vanity. Thumbs up. Thank you Park Hyatt. :-)).
