Got a really great deal off expedia. Hotel was very convenient, food, shopping, and site seeing. Was always greeted by the concierge desk and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Brought my Rottweiler and they had no issues, unlike other hotels which will not accept my dogs breed because its considered a bulldog. Went to the skybar on the 29th floor, had a nice selection of drinks but the bar is smaller then expected.
