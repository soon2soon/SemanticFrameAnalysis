It is the architecture that helps define the character of the city and Chicago is one of those special cities whose skyline is constantly changing and evolving, showcasing the era of its time. Well, with several companies doting the shores of the river, it becomes hard to choose...which one? Well..after discussing with friends, seeing the crowds, and of course checking out Yelp, one choice kept coming up: Shoreline. After my tour, I couldn't help but say it was awesome! The ship was comfortable, the price reasonable, and the tour guide made the experience truly special. The tours are fairly effortless. The schedule is very regular whether you want to get an early start to the day, if you want to sleep in, or if you want to see the city at night. Either case, stroll up to the dock and purchase your ticket(s) and head on to the boat. Well..before you get to the boat, they take that obligatory tourist photo. Yet, once you get that out of the way, you're on board and will be on your way. While I don't think you often consider it, the boat seemed rather safe and the crew seemed very professional. Now, the reason you pick Shoreline. The tour guide. Victor was amazing and he was so full of knowledge and clearly was passionate about his city and its architecture. He knew facts like the back of his hand and had his own nerdy quirky knowledge that really showed he did his homework and then some. He was awesome and full of life that gave the tour its own personality. So, for the Ted Mosby fan's out there (that was a How I Met Your Mother reference), check out Shoreline's architecture tour, you won't be disappointed. p.s. word of advice, bring an icy beverage, if not get one when you board and enjoy the city! It was a tad hot during the summer day I went.
