The Location of this hotel is just about perfect. It is right behind the Hancock Tower and just off Michigan, so you are so close to the lake, and the best shopping in town. Plus you get to avoid the insanity of the michigan ave Hotels. The rooms are comfy, the showers a bit wierd or european, you feel a bit bad since everything gets wet, but the shower head feels great, And they have very nice towels for that, you will feel them and go, wow, I want these. They can make that happen. The beds were insanley comofortable. They have just about everything you need in the room and can order in anything for you. The meeting rooms on the roof offer and elegant and experiential opportunity to show off. They have views of the Hancock Tower and the lake and are very well appointed.
