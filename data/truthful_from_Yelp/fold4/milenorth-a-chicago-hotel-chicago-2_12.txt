I gave this hotel a shot for my husband's birthday weekend. I found a groupon, and upgraded to the king suite because we have a 5 year-old, and the pullout couch idea was perfect. I had read several yelp reviews prior to our arrival, and decided to try it for myself and form my own opinion. When we arrived at our room (2501), I was a little concerned that it was right next to the elevator because I had read several reviews stating that it was noisy being next to the elevator. To my pleasant surprise, the elevator was extremely quiet. (I Â am a light sleeper) The view from our room is excellent and the temperature of our suite was comfortable. My daughter was hungry around 8:30 at night, and it was bone-chilling cold outside so it was very convenient to head down to the lobby to grab some fresh fruit and other healthy snacks. We did not partake in the hotel's breakfast, but there are some good places nearby which the friendly front desk staff recommended. This hotel's location cannot be beaten, and the price is reasonable. Every staff member was friendly, both on the phone and face to face. We would choose MileNorth again.
