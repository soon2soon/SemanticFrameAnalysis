Stayed here for 2 nights pre-christmas to get some time in downtown Chicago prior to heading out to the burbs with family.  What a great experience we had at this hotel as it was close to a ton of shopping, restaurants and Rush street.  We actually stayed in 2 different rooms, first 2406 which was a large room with 2 queen beds.  This room was the perfect size for our family of 4 but the views were just ok.  The second room 1702 was a king suite on the end of the hall which was a  bit smaller than the other room but had great views of Michigan Ave and the downtown skyline.  I think the best part of the stay however was the hospitality of the staff.  EVERYONE was amazing and very helpful.  We interacted with the front desk, front door, room service and others and I would say not a bad person in the bunch.  The room service was amazingly fast (10 minutes) and the food was very good.  When I come to Chicago again I will definitely stay at this hotel.
