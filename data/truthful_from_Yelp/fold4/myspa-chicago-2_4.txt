While in Chicago I got time off for good behavior. My son treated me to a Spa Day. BEST.MASSAGE.EVER. Ask for Kim. Spa itself was wonderful - low lighting, sauna, fruit and drinks, top shelf bath products, comfortable robes and flip flops. It was just like being Queeen for the Day (not that I'm old enough to remember that show, but my Mom watched it!) Â And that's what my son made me on this day. Life is good.
