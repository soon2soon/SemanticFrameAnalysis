I used Second City Trolley for a 50th birthday party with about 100 guests. We got three trolleys and therefore three drivers.   All three had fantastic personalities and were totally cool.  Our guests were mostly gay men which was a total non-issue for our drivers.  I will definitely use Second City Trolley again.
