I loved it. After agonizing for days as to where to stay for one night in Chicago, somehow the Raffaello stood out. For one it was offering double beds (traveling with my 16 year old son) for a great price. It was charming & a perfect "boutique size." CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN without gaudy bedspreads & depressing artwork adorning the walls. I got in & out but I did see a little line to check in later on in the day but that seems to be the case in larger establishments, also. Unfortunately the rooftop bar had not been open on Monday but next time. A cute doughnut shop is inside the lobby called Glazed & Confused..nice touch. I did not make it to the gym, spa, or restaurant but again, I will return to this hotel. Full of Charm. I am very lucky to have stumbled upon the Raffaello! 5 from me.
