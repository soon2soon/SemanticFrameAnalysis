From the minute you walk in, this hotel is very upscale. Our room was spacious, the bed was was comfortable, and the pillows plush.  With all the dining out we were doing, the kitchenette was nice to have (the fridge in particular).  I also enjoyed the complementary popcorn, as I was starving when we got there the first day and needed something to hold me over until dinner. The complementary breakfast was above par.  Normally the hotels I stay at offer cereals, bagels, and juices.  This was a completely different experience.  This hotel offered eggs, sausage, potatoes, Belgian waffles, muffins, English muffins, juices and more.  Very, very good.  There was also a woman (whom I believe runs the kitchen) who was making sure everyone had what they needed and was even making waffles.  She was the most attentive person I have ever had the pleasure of crossing paths with at a hotel. We had a wonderful experience here and would definitely recommend it.
