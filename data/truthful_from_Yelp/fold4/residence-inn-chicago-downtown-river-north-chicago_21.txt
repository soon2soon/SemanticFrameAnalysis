This is a newer property in the heart of Chicago - outstanding location! I like both the Springhill and Residence Inn franchises - more room. Service and cleanliness were very good here and the lobby well appointed. For the location and the quality of the facilities, this is a top-notch value. 5 stars means that for this price point in this market, this is as good as it does get. Sure there are better hotels, but probably not at this price. (On this date, it was $204 per night all up.)
