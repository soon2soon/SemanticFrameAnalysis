I went into Scuba Sensations last night because my husband was looking for a new mask, we both needed snorkels, and I am in need of a scuba refresher before our trip to the Philippines next month.  We didn't expect much given that it's a small shop off of the street, but we were actually quite impressed. The owner, Rami, was very nice and encouraged my husband to try a bunch of different masks until he found the right one.  Rami wasn't pushy at all, in fact, he talked about the pros/cons about all snorkels / masks, whether there was a more expensive alternative or not.   Scuba Sensations seemed to carry a nice selection of gear and we were impressed at the inventory in the store.  We found prices to be very reasonable.  My husband looked online when we got home and masks were the same cost online as he paid in the store (we knew we wanted to support an independent store, but knowing that we didn't get ripped off in the process is a bonus!). Rami was clearly very knowledgeable about the equipment and encouraging about our trip.  I am looking forward to taking my refresher course with him in a week or so and I'll update my review if anything changes.
