We took a cruise to celebrate my birthday. It was AWESOME!!! I had never been on a fancy lunch cruise like this before so I didnt know what to expect.  We were treated like royalty!  The boat was not full so everyone on board was lucky enough to have a window seat. It was a beautiful sunny day (because it was my birthday of course). Our waitress Jaime was super nice.  She knew it was my birthday so she added candles to my birthday dessert dish (chocolate cake).  The cruise lunch came with a three course meal.  We ordered the lobster bisque, seafood cannelloni, chocolate cake, duck pastry dish, herb chicken, and peach and blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Everything tasted delicious!!! Even the complimentary bread (I had three of them before my meal!) was served hot tasted great! There was a band on the cruise so they played live music while we ate and cruised.  They also announced birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions if you were on the cruise for any of those reasons.  There are three decks which you were allowed to visit during the cruise.  The top deck was my favorite. The seating there was comfortable, you can really enjoy the Chicago skyline, and it was nice and sunny up there. What a great way to celebrate a birthday!!!
