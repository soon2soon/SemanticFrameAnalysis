So this place blows my mind again!!!! Was initially traveling 11 nights but was amending my plans, the reservation desk made such s big to do that canceling the weekend was going to throw my second set of dates into a corporate not approved rate so I booked my second week at another hotel. The sales manager Beth Andrews got the notification from Orbitz for business and took the time to contact them and have me call her. When I called she was so kind and valued me as a customer that this was amended to be within our corporate rate!This is my true second home, world class service! I feel valued! Stay will the Blackstone for top notch rooms, service, staff, and bell hops!
