I booked this hotel through Priceline bidding and couldn't have asked for a better home base in Chicago: beautiful, well appointed and conveniently located. Our room (1906) had a magnificent view of the downtown skyline, was HUGE and it's interior design aesthetic was opulent and sexy. The Concierge staff made fantastic dining and drinking recommendations catered to our interests and budget. All in all, a sweet location for a whirlwind, romantic weekend.
