Stayed here 9/27-9/30.  I would describe the Blu Aqua as understated luxury. Check in - check in was fast and efficient, the front desk agent greeted me courteously and acknowledged my gold status.  In fact they had upgraded me from a Park View room to a Park View suite! The room - the room was amazing, airy and spacious with wood floor with a beautiful modern design.  The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful with wonderful amenities. The fitness center - Great fitness center one of the best I have ever seen at a hotel.  Lots of free weights and cardio machines.  They have an indoor and outdoor pool as well as an indoor and outdoor jacuzzi.  They also have an outdoor kiddie pool. Service - Service was great, everyone was courteous and respectful and not pretentious.  I never got the feeling like people had a hand out waiting for a tip like at other hotels.   The lounge - wonderful lounge with great snacks and wine for dinner and a lovely breakfast.   There is also a 1/4 mile running track, billiards and a nice media room.  There is so much to do at this hotel, its almost a destination in itself! Nothing to complain about here, in fact my wife and I had a tremendous time, we will be back.  So happy that the Blu brand is here in the US.
