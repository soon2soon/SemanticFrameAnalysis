WOW!!! I live in Marriott hotels every week, for work, and this is one my most favorite ever. Luxurious beds, outstanding bathrooms, impeccable service, and the building itself... WOW!!!!! It may not be on Michigan Ave on top of the shopping, BUT you will feel like you're somewhere fabulous! Great gym facilities as well.
