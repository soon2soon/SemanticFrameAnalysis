We did this tour on a Friday beginning in the morning.   There were only three on the tour, which was a surprise.   Our tour guide, Mike was very personable , funny and patient.  Since it was just myself and a friend, he had to put up with our stories and questions.   He did this with patience and grace.   The food was delicious, with plenty to eat.  Mike was very engaging and informative taking time to share about Chicago's architecture, mob history, the Chicago fire and so much more.  It was a highlight of our trip and I would recommend it to anyone visiting the city.   The history he provided sparked our interest and we listened to historical podcasts on the six hour ride home on the topics from the tour.   The price was reasonable for the food and experience.    Bring a bottle of water if it's warm and wear appropriate clothes for the weather.   There were only two of the six locations where we sat indoors.   I can't wait for the next tour.
