Suite Home Chicago and The Grand Plaza will forever be special to our family!!! 13 months after buying a brand new house in Lakeview we found out that our home had mold and several other latent defects! We put all of our things in storage, packed our clothes and favorite posessions in suitcases and headed to a rental house. The landlords were lunatics...after three weeks we were moving again....withour 3 year old and dog in tow. By the time we got to Suite Home, I was a total stressed out,basket case, in deperate need of xanax!!! Â Ryan and Jen were amazing!!!!!! We moved into a gorgeous two bedroom place with AMAZING views of the city. They were super nice to us, provided us with everything we needed and totally exceeded our expecatios! We are finally back home, the house is fixed. Though we are in a lawsuit with the builde and we had to pay 60% of what the house cost in the first place to fx itwe can honestly say that Suite Home made a negative situation in our lives better! I would recommend them to anyone!!!! They are awesome, kind, trustingand professiona!
