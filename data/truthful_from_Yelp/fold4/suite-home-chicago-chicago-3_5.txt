This is my 2nd time with Suite Home Chicago and it was even better the second time.  Jennifer and Sarah could not have been more helpful with quick responses to my thousands of questions.  They found me exactly the kind of apt I was looking for and in the ideal location.  The apartments furnishings were as nice or better then a very nice hotel with everything you could think of in the kitchen.  The desk staff also very helpful and the amenities at both One Superior Place and my recent stay at Randolph Towers were fantastic.  These ladies really know how to take care of their clients and were more than helpful with anything I needed.  Don't waste your time looking for better deals and better locations, they literally have The Best!
