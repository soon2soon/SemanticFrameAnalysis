Just wrapped up the Wicker Park tour a few hours ago - had a great guide (Alyssa) who was tremendously knowledgeable.  Hit 6 great spots that included bacon donuts, Chicago Pizza, tacos, fried chicken and more.  We had a large group of close friends which made it all the more fun.  Book this with confidence - these guys are the real deal. We've also taken their tour in New York City of the Greenwich Village neighborhood and it was absolutely outstanding.  A "must do!"   The tour takes you through both the business districts and residential areas of Wicker Park, and the guide explains the sights and history as you walk from food stop to food stop.  A fun mix of learning and eating.
