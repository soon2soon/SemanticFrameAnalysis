Best TOUR of Chicago when it comes to food, history, and culture. I gifted this tour to my sister for her birthday and both of us had the best Sunday Funday while we walked around in the sun with Ashley, our tour guide, making sure we have the best time- and we sure did! We chose the Wicker Park one and thanks to GoldStar it was 30 dollars per person. We had 4 different stops that included where we ate, and we had stops to mansions, neighborhoods, a church, stores, and many more spots and learned tons. This a great tour to take whether you're doing it as a date, with friends, or with your family. The 3 hour tour included a half of a doughnut at Glazed and Infused, meatballs at Chop Shop with a chance to meet with the owner, 2 chicken wings at Harold's, and two tacos at Antique Taco, and your choice of macaron at Alliance Bakery. The macaron was my favorite eat, the best I have ever tasted. I did appreciate the quality of food that was chosen as well as the family based businesses and history of all the restaurants we visited. We had time at all the places to eat and enjoy while walking it off. You have a chance to order a drink and chat at the restaurants and Ashley was so sweet, very laid back personality, and made connections and added her sense of humor to the tour. Her education and passion for food and culture was highlighted through out the whole tour. Really wonderful time and I would do it again! Strongly recommend it! :)
