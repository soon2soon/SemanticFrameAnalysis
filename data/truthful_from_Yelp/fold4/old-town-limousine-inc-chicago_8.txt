I agree with everything the other reviewer said!   Balal (I always thought it was "Bilal?" -- sorry, Balal!) is such a professional, and the cars are clean and comfy.   He's on time, courteous, and takes the time to confirm every detail.  As stated previously, he's very sensitive to when you feel like talking and when you don't, but is a smart and interesting guy when you DO feel like talking.   Besides Balal, I've also been in the company of another driver who was equally professional.  I've only used their service for work trips, but I'd absolutely use them for personal trips and/or family & friends coming to town.   Really, one of the best!
