The short: -Put my parents and my fiancee's parents up here over the weekend and they both said it was great -The rooms were clean -The view was nice -The price was affordable -The staff was helpful -The free breakfast in the morning was great -The location is awesome (easy for red line access, the rest of the lines are in walking distance in the loop) One of the best places to stay in the area for sure!
