This LDS has the ability to be one of the best in the Chicago - North Shore area. Rami, the owner, has a great personality. I have already taken one DAN class with him and hope to take more. He understands the concept that, "one size does not always fit all" in instruction. My daughter and I went with him during a Discover Scuba class. We had different needs (some refresher training for an up-coming dive trip), and Rami worked out things so we had everything we needed. It is exciting to find a business owner, in any field, take as much interest in customers and potential customers as Rami does.
