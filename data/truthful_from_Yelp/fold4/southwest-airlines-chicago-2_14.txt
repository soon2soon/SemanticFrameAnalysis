I've been flying on and off with Southwest for almost ten years. Although I have used other airlines, Southwest continues to be a favorite. They're easy to deal with, usually on time, extremely affordable, very friendly (I've never met anyone that seemed unhappy to work for Southwest -- some of the flight attendants even make jokes and laugh with everyone), comfortable, clean, and you don't have to pay ridiculous fees to check bags! I'm pretty low-maintenance and don't ask for too much extra when I'm traveling, so I have no issues with anything they do. The only downside is that they only fly out of Midway (as well as limited airports across the country). I don't have anything against Midway (I actually prefer Midway to O'Hare), but O'Hare is so much closer to me. That's OK. Nothing's perfect.
