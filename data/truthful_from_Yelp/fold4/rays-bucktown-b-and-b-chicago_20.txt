I absolutely LOVED my stay at Ray's! My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights there for a Chicago vacation, and this place was even better than we hoped. The whole staff was personable, gracious, and accommodating. The rooms were comfortable and the amenities were great - homemade breakfast each morning (you can order whatever you want, and it's fantastic), robes in each room, private bathrooms, and a sauna and steam room! They even allow you to do laundry with a washer, dryer, and supplied detergent if you need to. Snacks and free water are available for the taking, which makes traveling even easier. The B&B was also in a perfect location, just a 10-15 minute walk to the closet stop on the EL (Western on the Blue line) and 20 minutes to get downtown from there. If you're taking the bus, there are closer stops. The neighborhood is a great area with tons of bars & restaurants, not to mention some high-end boutique shopping. If I'm ever in Chicago again, I will absolutely be staying here. The place was charming and friendly, and made my first trip to the city fantastic!
