We did the Wicker Park tour and it was delightful.  I am from Chicago and took my mom who was visiting.  It was a great way to share some knowledge about this neighborhood and get some tasty bites from unique restaurants that really showcase Chicago food.  You receive small tastings from each of the 6 locations visited.  Don't be fooled, it may be a tiny piece of pizza, but after visiting all the restaurants I was good for the day.  We went on a rainy day but it didn't deter the tour at all.
