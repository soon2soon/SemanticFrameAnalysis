My son and I took the 2 hour tour this past weekend.  A little nervous at first, but our guide Joel was great and he made sure that everybody in our group was comfortable before we got on our way. Only took 5 minutes or so before everybody was able to stay together and away we went.  Joel made sure to double back to help out those who were still getting up to speed.   I would recommend this to Chicagoans as well, one of the best times I've had downtown in a long while!
