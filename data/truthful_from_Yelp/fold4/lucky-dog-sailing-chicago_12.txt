My husband and I kicked around the idea of taking sailing lessons but decided to book a day-trip sailing on the Lucky Dog Sailing charter instead, and I'm SO glad we did!. The weather was amazing, the boat was gorgeous and the Captain and his wife couldn't have been friendlier. They took pictures of us throughout the trip, and even let me take the wheel of their boat for some photo-ops. It was the most relaxing and enjoyable day I've had all summer, so we booked two more trips with friends!!
