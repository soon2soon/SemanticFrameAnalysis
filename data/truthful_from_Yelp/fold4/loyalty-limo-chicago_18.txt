I contacted Loyalty Limo in a last min attempt to book a limo for my birthday party. Even though I was on such short notice (less than 24 hours) Vince was more than accommodating! We were upgraded to a 16 passenger since a 10 passenger was not available and he gave us a great deal. Our driver David (super cute guy btw) was right on time and was there any time I needed the limo pulled up. Also the limo was equipped with beer and refreshments which helped keep the party going ;) Thank you!!!
