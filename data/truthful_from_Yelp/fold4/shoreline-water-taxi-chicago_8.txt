My mom and aunt were visiting me recently and after spending five hours at the Shedd and the Field we were tired. When I spotted the water taxi about to take off I ran to buy tickets. I don't think three people have ever enjoyed riding in a boat so much. It was a beautiful day. The incredible skyline was laid out in front of us. This was the most fun my legs had that entire weekend. For all the planning I did before they came it was this last minute idea that was everyone's favorite. Best $23 dollars I ever spent.
