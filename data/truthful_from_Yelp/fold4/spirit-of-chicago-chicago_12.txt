Spirit of Chicago was a great choice for entertaining my boyfriend's parents while they were in town. The buffet offered a good variety of tasty food including delicious deserts. Everyone had plenty to eat and really enjoyed their meal. We cruised on a Wednesday night, so we were also treated with watching the Navy Pier fireworks from the water, which is definitely the best place to view them. It was a perfect way to show our guests the beautiful, fun city in which we live.
