So much fun! I purchased a groupon a few months ago and we waited for the weather to clear up to go. The guides (Ed and I dont remember the other 2 names) - Awesome theater majors that turned tour guides. Perfectly entertainmenting while touring Chicago on a Segway! We had fun with them, we even had a mini "race" going around a garden! That was fun!! The Segway - Zoom Zoom... I dont remember the last time I had so much fun! The need for speed is human nature, and this provides you some much needed speed! It is MUCH easier to control the segway than I ever thought.. your feet do get tired at the end though, imagine standing in 1 place for 2 hours... so wear comfy shoes! The tour - OK lets be honest, how many people REALLY go on a SEGWAY tour just to see Chicago... probably 90% go for the awesome 2 wheel machine! However, I did get much more out of the tour than expected! The guides actually gave us a little bit of a history lesson about chicago, the lake front and went to the back of soldier field! The whole experience - AMAZING! If you go without a deal it is a bit pricey, but if you have the money to spend, it is TOTALLY worth the experience!
