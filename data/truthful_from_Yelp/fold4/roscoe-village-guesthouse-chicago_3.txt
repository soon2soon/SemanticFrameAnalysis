Five of us came to town for 5 days for our son's wedding, and stayed in one of the guesthouses.   The location was convenient to all of our activities.   The guesthouse was our "base of operations".   The place was immaculate and had everything we seemed to need in the well appointed kitchen.   I even put the backyard grill to good use one night. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms had plenty of hot water, parking was convenient, and lots of interesting restaurants within walking distance.  The neighborhood was full of happy children, and we enjoyed a game of Frisbee in a nearby park.   We go well acquainted with the #50 bus to get us anywhere in the city.The neighborhood was full of happy children, and we enjoyed a game of Frisbee in a nearby park.   We go well acquainted with the #50 bus to get us anywhere in the city. Our "wired" set took full advantage of the fast wi-fi connection.    I had wanted to stay in a hotel, but my wife thought this would be more "homey" and see was right, it was a great decision.     The only downside to us was that the toaster seemed to be hard-wired to the smoke alarm, but once we figured out to turn the exhaust fan one before we did any cooking all was well.
