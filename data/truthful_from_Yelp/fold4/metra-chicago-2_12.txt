The Metra is awesome. Seeing the world from a train is always so much more different than from a car or on foot. Sometimes I take random Metra rides just to see all of the cool stops along the way in suburbs that I've never heard of. Two lines that are really great for a random trip are the BNSF to Aurora where the last stop is the historic Walter Payton's Roundhouse, and the Union Pacific North line that goes all the way up to Kenosha Wisconsin where you can see some really cool lighthouses on the nice lakefront and those cool electric streetcar things. If you're into photography, I'd also recommend getting on the train and taking a ride because it brings the whole world to you at a speed that your mind's eye can digest and all you have to do is get off the train at the next stop if you see something you want to capture. Alcohol may be consumed on the Metra trains so BYOB or wine or whatever and take a joy ride out somewhere for a round trip of about $11. It's really a great time, but maybe I'm just a square like that. I'm sure other people would give Metra one star or something because they have to take it to work as part of their daily grind, but you know it'll get lots of people to work/home and others to places they've never seen for cheap.
