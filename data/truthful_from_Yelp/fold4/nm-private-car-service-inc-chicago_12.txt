First time user of this service and will use again.  It was raining this morning and I knew trying to get a regular cab would not work.  I checked on internet and found this car service with 5 star reviews.  I spoke to Neil (the owner) early in the morning to see if he had a car that could take me to downtown Chicago today. He didn't fail and Andy was on time and I received email confirmation and text when Andy arrived.  The overall experience was terrific, everyone very friendly, clean Lincoln Town Car, and experienced driver. They use a flat rate system so no surprises.  You won't go wrong using this car service.
