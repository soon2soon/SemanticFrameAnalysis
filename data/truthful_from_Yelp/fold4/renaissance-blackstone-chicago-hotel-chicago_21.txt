I recently stayed here for business while attending a conference at the Hilton across the street. The hotel is beautiful and my room was half the price as at the Hilton. The details in the decor (particularly in the bathroom and mix of modern and vintage furniture) are amazing. Good service, nice workout room, and a Starbucks on site.
