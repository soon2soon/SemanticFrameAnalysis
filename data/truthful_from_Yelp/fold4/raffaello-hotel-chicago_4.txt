My husband and I stayed there this weekend and it was a great experience .. kind staff it was valentines weekend.   When I checked in they gave me a rose and they also  had champagne with strawberries .   very close to water tower place and walking distance to Mike Ditkas .    nice boutique hotel and great location.
