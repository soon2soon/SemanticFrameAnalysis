Incredible hospitality experience! Not only is the hotel a historic gem, but the service was impeccable. If you have the opportunity to get a room facing Grant Park, you're in for an extra treat. Loved the openness of the room as well as the uniqueness of the decor. This was NOT a boring hotel by any stretch. I highly recommend this property.
