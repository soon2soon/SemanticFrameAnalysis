We stayed at the MileNorth for our family vacation to Chicago.  We came in on the train, so our needs were something with some space (so our daughter could have her own bed), convenient to the Mag Mile, and economical.  We played some online hotel site roulette and wound up choosing the MileNorth. We will definitely stay at the MileNorth again if we do another Chicago vacation.  The staff is friendly and efficient--Joel manned the entrance each night and always welcomed us back after our adventures.  The facilities are excellent--nothing is brand new (there were some small chips in the bathroom tile, a little sign of wear on the wooden furniture, etc.), but it was clean, in good repair, and everything was very comfortable. What surprised us the most in the room was how quiet it was--we had a middle suite on the 27th floor, and the bathroom shares a back wall with the elevator.  We never heard the elevator, nor did we hear anyone else on the floor (even though I know we had neighbors on both sides). The rooftop bar is a novelty--it's a nice area, but you definitely pay a premium for drinks.  Gino's next door has much cheaper drinks if that's all you're looking for. Our one complaint (more of a wish) is that the suites had a little more separation between the living area and the bedroom.  It's really just one large room, even though it seems that it would be pretty simple to put in a wall between the two areas and give the bedroom some privacy.
