Great, reliable hotel, Mona has helped us every time when in a jam, great location, parking 1/2 block away, right across from Belmont harbor, close to everything you would need, ez cab any time of the day for those not from here. Suites are spacious and clean, everything at snack bar $1 not the case at most hotels where water is $7-10,
