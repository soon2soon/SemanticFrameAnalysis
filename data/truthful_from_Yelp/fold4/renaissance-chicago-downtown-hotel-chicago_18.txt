Recently stayed here for a brief visit to Chicago.  We came into Midway Airport and took the subway/CTA to the hotel.  The subway was practically connected to the airport and the train stop was literally 10 steps from the Renaissance's back door.  Couldn't have been more convenient. Customer service was expeditious and to top it off, the view from our room was absolutely spectacular! Highly recommend!
