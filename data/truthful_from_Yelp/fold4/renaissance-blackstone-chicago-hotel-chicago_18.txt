"A Beautiful Hotel on the Magnificent Mile!" Our recent mid-west Baseball tour allowed us to spend 3 wonderful nights in Chicago! We could not have picked a better place to stay. This restored art deco hotel in the middle of the Mag Mile was so beautiful! The room was huge, and well appointed. The bed was comfy and the everything was simply beautiful. Close proximity to the EL which we bought a 3 day pass and took everywhere we visited in the city unless we were walking. Certainly a place we would stay again if in Chicago.
