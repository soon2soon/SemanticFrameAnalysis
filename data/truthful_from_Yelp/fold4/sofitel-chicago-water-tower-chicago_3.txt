The Sofitel provided one of the best hotel experience of my entire life. They were very accommadating to me and my boyfriend. We needed an early check in and a late check out due to our flights and with no hassle or hoops they allowed our requests. Their staff is professional and friendly as well as polite. One of the bell boys even provided me with an umbrella to use as we desperately needed one! Our first morning we had an amazing lunch at the hotel restaurant. We had an appetizer which featured fresh salmon topped w capers and a lovely herb cheese. Followed by a Lobster tail sandwich, which was as mouthwatering as the Lamb Burger. In addition, we also experienced Le Bar (hotel bar), where the drinks were strong enough and tasty. We also tried the bar for food, the loaded fries were so delicious my bf was feeding me the crumbs :) The rooms are very clean and spacious, accompanied by a rob and slippers which was very nice and soft. The views focus on what every tourist should focus on...the skyline. Endless views of city lights and if you are lucky watching the storms from the 24th floor is breathless. The beautiful lighting throughout the room compliments its decor perfect and the super comfy bed features luxurious soft sheets. Thank you Sofitel for complimenting our Chicago trip, we will definitely be returning.
