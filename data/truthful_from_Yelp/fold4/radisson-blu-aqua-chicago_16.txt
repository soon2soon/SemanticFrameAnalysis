This is the nicest hotel I've stayed at. I'm not a huge traveler but without question if in Chicago and location, great rooms, and service is important, you've found it. We had a conference here in mid April and the job this staff did during three days of loaded events was incredible. From food prep, to room prep, and guest accommodations, the GM should be very proud. The wifi situation in certain conference rooms was a bit tricky but not a huge deal.
