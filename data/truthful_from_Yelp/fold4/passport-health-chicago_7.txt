I came to Passport Health to get several vaccines that I needed for my work travels.  I was very impressed with the personalized way in which they handled my needs.   I was given a personal booklet with information about any countries I might be traveling to, and was counseled by a nurse who gave me specific information about any medications or vaccines I might need in the future if my destinations were to change.  The staff was very kind and although I am not bothered by needles, I believe that their friendly and fun attitude would be a comfort to someone who is.
