I was extremely excited when I saw a deal for the sidewalk food tour in wicker park. As a local who lives in the neighborhood - I was curious to see the restaurant choices since we have about 100 highly rated local spots. And the food tour did an INCREDIBLE job choosing the top food spots in Wicker Park. The taste portions were a good fill until we hit all the spots. I really enjoyed the element of the walking tour because we covered a good portion of the neighborhood and also received an awesome history lesson. I highly recommend the tour to all locals and visitors. Great job and can't wait to do it again next year!!!
