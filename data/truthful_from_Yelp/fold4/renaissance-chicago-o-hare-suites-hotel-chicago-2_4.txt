We stayed here for a night after American Airlines delayed our flight, ruining our connection here in Chicago. I give them zero stars. As for this hotel, I was expecting very little. However, from the moment we walked in we were pleasantly surprised!! The desk staff were very friendly and got us checked in quickly. From there we went to a nice suite room which was nothing fancy, but very clean and comfortable. All the furnishings throughout the hotel were very clean and appeared new. Our meals in their restaurant were both excellent and again were served by very friendly staff. All in all, this place isn't the Ritz....but for the money spent it was a wonderful place to stay. To confirm, yes I give them 5 stars!!!
