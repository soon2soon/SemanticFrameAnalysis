I stayed 3 nights here in December and I could not have enjoyed it more.  I usually travel for business but this time my boyfriend was joining me for the weekend.  We arrived at 7am at the Hyatt and we were just hoping to drop off our bags and find a place to eat breakfast.  To our surprise, the Hyatt let us check in early!  I've never checked in this early, to the point they could have charged us for an extra night.  They also took our preferences of newspapers and didn't care that we each had different favorite papers.   I also think there is someone watching the lobby, because the elevator doors always seem to open just when we approach the elevator bay.  It's really nice not to have to wait for an elevator! We had the Park Deluxe King room, and it was really spacious, comfortable, and nice!  The bathroom is huge.  My only complaint is that the light in the bathroom should be brighter and whiter.  The room comes with a giant bathtub for two, and even includes bath salt and tea light candles.  It's pretty amazing if you want to have a relaxing low key vacation!   Free internet is always a plus!  And there is complimentary water, hand tied tea, coffee, and juice available downstairs in the lobby.  They had warm apple cider while I was there, and I couldn't get enough of that! The front desk, concierge, and bell boys are really amazing and have been trained well.  Service is top notch.   The location was also perfect.  It's super close to the Metro stop as well as right off of Michigan.  We were able to walk to all the nice restaurants and shops and save money on cab fare.
