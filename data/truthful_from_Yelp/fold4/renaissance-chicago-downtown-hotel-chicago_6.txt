My husband had a conference here last week.  The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Chicago.    It's right  across the street from the Chicago River.  Theatres and Joffrey Ballet are a block away.  Chicago Symphony,, Grant Park,  The Bean are all a short walking distance away. Tho hotel itself was great.  Bar Novo is in the lobby and they serve great drinks and have a Tapas menu.  Great Street Restaurant is on the second floor and has great views of the city.  Ate breakfast here and the food and service was great. The rooms were big and super comfortable bed.  We had a great view from our 11th floor window.  Chicago river was to one side, the theatres to the other side, and directly across the street was the Rooftop Bar at The Wit that is wonderfully lit up at night. The only negative is $14.95 a night for internet service.  There is free internet in lobby and sitting area on second floor outside of Great Street Restaurant.
