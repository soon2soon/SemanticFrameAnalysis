Hotel was very nice but the View from my room was only lacking a blinking neon light to make me feel like i was in a 1950s heartbreak movie. Room was clean and the bed very comfortable. I love the old classic hotels and this one was very well kept and the staff was excellent. Overall I enjoyed my stay.
