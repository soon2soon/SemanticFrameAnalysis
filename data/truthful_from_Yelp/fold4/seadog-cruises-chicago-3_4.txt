This is the way to tour Chicago! As a first time visitor to the Windy City, I didn't know where to start the sightseeing. Luckily I had a Chicago native with me who highly recommended Sea Dog's architecture cruise. Sightseeing at its finest! Moving slowly down the Chicago River, I was in awe of the skyscrapers and buildings that could be seen. You get to see everything from the new Trump Tower to the mighty Sears Tower, and everything in between. A tour is only as good as the guide you have and ours was exceptional. Sadly, I forget his name but he was real down to earth and very knowledgable about everything Chicago. I highly recommend this tour to any first time visitors or people looking for some great views of the city.
