My boyfriend came here with his roommate not too long ago and all he did was rave to me about how good the pho is. Of course being outside of argyle I get a bit skeptical. When my boyfriend took me here I was pleasantly surprised on how good the pho really is! They also give you a good amount of meat with the pho so I loved it even more  if you are ever around in the area give it a try! The cevapcici spring roll is pretty tasty too. It's a fusion of the regular Vietnamese spring roll with a kick of Croatian style meat.  the owner is also extremely nice which I always love supporting kind hearted people
