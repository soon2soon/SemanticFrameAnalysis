Stayed her over 4th of July weekend and couldn't have been happier. We made our reservations over one of those "travel sites", you never know with those.... BUT here are the pros -Extremely friendly hotel staff (not always the case in Chicago I mention they all remembered our names and were super helpful with calling us cabs, recommending places and giving directions -CLEAN rooms and bathrooms -affordable minibar ($2 beer, $1 snacks, $15 champagne) -great location-easy walking distance to Wrigley and the beach -parking with in and out privileges (about a block away..$22 a day) -free breakfast (nothing fancy but I did like the jimmy dean breakfast sandwiches and cranberry juice) -free cookies from 4-6 (VERY good chocolate chip!) -Full-Sized shampoo/conditions/soap/body lotion in the bathroom -comfy robes to wear in the room or down to breakfast -DVD player in room Cons -tiny elevator (I mean TINY!!!) -no valet to parking garage (hard when you have your bags at check in and check out) I will definately stay here again, other reviews say the rooms were small but ours seemed just fine for the two of us. We had a standard room and it had room to walk, put our luggage, a desk..
