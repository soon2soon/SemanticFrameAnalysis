Hey CTA, you are nice and everything but I'm seeing someone else. I take Metra every day to work, and I really try to take it any time that I need to get downtown. Metra wins in every category when you compare it to driving or taking the CTA. When I take Metra, I don't have to pay parking fees or worry about how long CTA will take or sit in the dirty CTA trains. I can just relax on a nice clean train and take a quick ride downtown or out to the suburbs. Plus, you can't beat the $5 weekender tickets. I cannot recommend Metra enough for July 3rd. After the Independence Day fireworks at Taste of Chicago, Metra will line up all their trains, fill them up with people, and send them off when full. "Convenient" does not even begin to describe this. As the masses of people are heading for CTA and waiting forever just to get on a train and probably stand for the whole trip, Metra riders can just walk right on to their train, sit down, and it will leave as soon as it fills.
