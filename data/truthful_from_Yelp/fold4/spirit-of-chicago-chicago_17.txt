We did a dinner cruise for a group of 400.  We all got together for a software conference and this was our out of the hotel event.  We have done restaurants, aquarium visits with this group in the past.  This was by far the best event we have done.  Everyone was raving.  DJ Alex had a group of accountants and IT professionals dancing on the dance floor.  The staff was very accommodating and helpful.  I wouldn't hesitate to do a cruise on the Spirit of Chicago again.  In fact when we come back to Chicago, this will be the first thing we plan.
