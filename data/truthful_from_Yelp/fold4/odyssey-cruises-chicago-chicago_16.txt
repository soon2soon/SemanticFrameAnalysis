I was proposed to by my now husband on an Odyssey Dinner Cruise and it was a magical night (so keep that in mind when you are reading this review as I was in a love-struck daze)! They went to great lengths to help him plan this proposal, complete with sending my sister a fake flyer stating that she had won 2 dinner cruise tickets. Despite all that planning, though, they missed one small detail.....and that was where to send me once I arrived. As a result, they accidentally messed up my husband's proposal plans by sending me to the wrong floor where he was supposed to be hiding out. I didn't mind at all, but they felt absolutely horrible about it and tried to make up for it all night by upgrading his meal to a steak. They also gave us dessert and two extra champagne glasses to boot. In terms of the food, I thought it was pretty good and my husband enjoyed his steak. I have also been on Spirit and Mystic Cruises on Lake Michigan as well and nothing compares to the ambiance of the Odyssey. The pros for this one compared to Spirit is that, in my opinion, it seemed a little classier as I am not the type who wants to see my server sing karaoke (albeit good karaoke) all night long. The downside would be that Odyssey tends to be a little bit pricier. I would highly recommend doing the evening cruise. The skyline is so beautiful when it is all lit up. Good music and a fireworks show finished our night. So happy that they were part of that magical moment.
