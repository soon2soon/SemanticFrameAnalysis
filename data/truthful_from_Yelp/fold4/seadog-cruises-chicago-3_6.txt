We can all agree that Navy Pier pretty much sux.  But, the super fast Sea Dog boat excursion is awesome!  Go on a warm, sunny day.  It really is quite thrilling.  The architecture cruise is nice and mellow and interesting but the speed boat ride, oh my...this one will get your heart raising.  I've done it three times and each time had a wonderful tour guide.  Yep, would do the super fast sea dog boat ride again in heart beat.  5 stars for sure!
