Really loving this place, especially because they upgraded us to a room overlooking the water--great view! Quick access to the L, plus a short walk to Millennium Park. The contemporary lobby that has a comfortable meeting area, plus the Novo Bar is great for a drink. Their pool is open until 10pm, and the gym is 24 hours. There is a public bike sharing area cross the street, which we used to tour the parks and shoreline. And you step right outside for pretty stroll down the Riverwalk, and there you can catch river cruises nearby . The rooms are nice, comfortable and modern (although it would nice to have fans in the bathroom). WiFi works great, and beds are wonderfully comfortable--much appreciated after exploring the area all day on foot. And the staff was truly helpful, all of which made our stay exceptional.
