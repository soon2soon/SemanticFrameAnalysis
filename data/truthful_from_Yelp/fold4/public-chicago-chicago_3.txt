I cannot begin to describe how charming this hotel is. Not only are the rooms extremely comfy, but they're aesthetically beautiful. Their service is impeccable; everyone was very accommodating and hospitable. Their coffee shop and restaurant are also on point. Their location is also perfect--close to great restaurants, shopping, and downtown, without having to deal with the congestion of traffic and hecticness.
