Best sightseeing deal in town!!!! Board at Navy Pier and take it all the way to Union Station and you'll see Chicago from a spectacular vantage point. For only $7, it really beats all those "architecture tours" which cost $40+ and you take the exact same route. Unless you really want someone with a microphone telling you boring facts about the buildings and cracking corny jokes. Best kept scenic secret in Chicago!!!
