my father and his lady were visiting from Boston and were seriously impressed with this hotel, as was I. friendly service, close to everything, and affordable rates. rooms were clean, modern, and quaint. the thing that makes this place most memorable is the martini bar. living in Chicago now for a few years, this place really blew me away, I am surprised I have never even heard of it before. Absolutely delicious martinis! Try the Berry White you won't be disappointed. If you like a mean drink, and old world charm, this place is for you. keep it classy millennium knickerbocker ;)
