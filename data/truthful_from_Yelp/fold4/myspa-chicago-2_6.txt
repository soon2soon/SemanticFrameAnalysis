I went here back in December for a massage and have been meaning to write a review on my awesome experience. I arrived at this place with some serious knots in my back and in desperate need of a massage to relieve the pain. My therapist was Leslie and I remember her name because this was literally the best massage I have ever had,  This girl is amazing.  She got all my deep knots out and was so professional in every aspect- from her movements in the room (you have to be very slow and deliberate when making any movements during a massage to walk, pick things up or set down etc... to maintain a relaxing environment) to her massage technique. I wish I could afford to go there every month to see her, and will gladly pay  the price tag for it because it is totally worth it.  I felt amazing when I left.   They let you make full use of the other spa amenities there after your service (sauna, showers etc...) which is also very nice.
