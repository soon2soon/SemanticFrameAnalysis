I was completely new to diving, and admittedly a little nervous about my first scuba trip, so I felt so fortunate finding Rami and Scuba Sensations. I could tell after a few minutes of conversation that this guy was the real deal: diving is a way of life for him, and he wants to share the passion with his clients. I chose to do my "classroom" study in Rami's shop, and that ended up being the perfect answer for me.... some of the basic principles of diving/dive safety that I read about only truly sunk in when Rami illustrated them thru conversation and visual references. And, as seriously as he treats the learning the necessary skills, he does it all with a casual ease and sense of humor that keep everything in perspective. Rami's got all of the gear you need as well, but he was never pushy about any of that... which made me want to support his small shop even more! All in all, I left for my vacation well-trained, with great gear, and what I would consider a new friend at Scuba Sensations!
