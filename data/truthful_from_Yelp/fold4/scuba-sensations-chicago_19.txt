Scuba Sensation is amazing. My husband and I took our classroom and pool instruction from Rami and his team, and we just completed our open water dive today.  We could not have enjoyed our experience more or be any happier.  Rami and his team are great instructors. Equally as important, they are fun, friendly and fantastic people. If you are interested in scuba, this is your place.  Big thumbs up to Rami, Joe, Steve, Brad, Larry and Kit!
