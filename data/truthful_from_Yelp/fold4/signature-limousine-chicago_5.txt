I recently planned a big vacation with my sister and nieces...  Since we were flying out and taking the train back, leaving the car at O'Hare didn't make sense, public transit takes...  forever...  and cabs aren't always plentiful at that hour.  (Or clean) Based on Jelena Z's recommendation alone, I HAD to give Signature Limousine a shot and whilst I had expected a stretch instead of a sedan, the driver was friendly, informative, engaging and the drive seemed to pass in absolutely no time.  To be honest, I think we had a much more enjoyable trip than we would have, if we had been closed off in the back of a stretch limo anyway.
