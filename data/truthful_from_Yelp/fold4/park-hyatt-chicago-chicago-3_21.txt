Great way to enjoy our 1st trip to Chicago.  Everything about this place is top shelf.  The location is awesome.  Walking distance to a lot of the things we wanted to explore in town...restaurants, tons of shopping and a lot of touristy sites.  The accommodations are 5 star, huge room and bathroom with all the amenities.  The service provided really made our stay.  They're genuinely friendly and good at what they do.  Every person you come in contact with is there to help you.  Lastly their in house restaurant, Nomi is unbelievable. I guess they used to have a Michelin star but their quality of food is still right there.  I had drinks there every night, tried dinner, breakfast and appetizers in the lounge....everything coming out of that kitchen was great.  Thanks for making my 4th year anniversary one to remember!!
