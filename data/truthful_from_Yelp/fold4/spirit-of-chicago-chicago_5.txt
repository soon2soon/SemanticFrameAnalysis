My man took me on a dinner cruise for my 30th birthday and we had fun and enjoyed ourselves! The buffet was small and intimate but super delicious, especially the baked tilapia! They had plenty of food and replenished it all night. One of the best parts was our server, Mekita. She was so friendly and took great care of us. We didn't buy a window seat but she moved us to one after everyone got on. A few couples moved over since there were empty seats available. We also went out on the deck and took some beautiful pictures and had a few drinks. They even had a DJ and a dancefloor. I will definitely do this again!
