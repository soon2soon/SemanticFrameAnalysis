I've parked here several times, and have always had a pleasant experiences.  The attendants and drivers are always courteous and helpful.  The shuttles are quick and always waiting for you when you return.  The price is good and you can always find coupons online. During my last parking experience, my car battery was dead upon arrival, and the staff were very helpful to give me assistance and get it started. They even cleaned the snow off my car.   Overall I have been very satisfied with my parking experiences here, and I will return every time I need to park at Midway.
