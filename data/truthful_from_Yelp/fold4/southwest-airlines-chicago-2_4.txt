What can you say about an airline that has two free checked bags as well as down to earth employees and affordable tickets year round? Well I personally can't say anything negative because my experiences have been nothing less than great. I have definitely loved the free checked bags. They have many different kiosks for full service or checking bags etc. Employees are always professional. I really enjoy flying southwest and I try to only book with them if I can. They finally started flying direct from Reagan DCA to MDW Â Chicago which is huge. But you can still find good tickets out of BWI or Dulles of from the DC dmv area. I don't think you can go wrong flying with southwest. They take customer service serious as well as giving us perks you really can't find anywhere else. The video I took was around 3am on the Sunday after thanksgiving. We lined up but no employees till about 340am or so. Kiosks took some time to boot up too. Bottom line: Save your money from the rest and fly southwest.
