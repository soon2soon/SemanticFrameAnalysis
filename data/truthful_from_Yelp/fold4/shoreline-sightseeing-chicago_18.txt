One of the things that we were really looking forward to on our first trip to Chicago was this architectural boat tour and we were not disappointed. Our tour guide made the city come to life with his knowledge of the city and it's buildings. We had such a great time learning and sightseeing. There is also a bar in the lower deck if you want to purchase a drink on this 75min boat tour. Even if you don't know much about architecture, I would still recommend this boat tour because it is just fun learning about the city, it's buildings and history. They really explain things very well. The tickets can be a little pricey, but it's worth it to go at least once.
