THIS WAS AMAZING!!! Our tour guide was Victor! He was EXCELLENTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He knew his city! He knew architecture! He was so informative. Very professional... with a cute little sense of humor!!! I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS! My husband is born and raised in Chicago. This was his first time doing tourist-y activities in Chicago... he thoroughly enjoyed this event and he stated that it would not have been the same without Victor being the tour guide. Victor's appreciate for building architecture and pride for his city was felt -- and it easily rubbed off to me as well as my family!! Kudos to Victor!! They say - find a job that you love to do so it won't feel like working... Victor is a true testimony to this because you could tell that he loved this! Architecture ran through his blood!!!!!
