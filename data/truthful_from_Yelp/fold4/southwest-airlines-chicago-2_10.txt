I love you Southwest. You always take care of me, I usually never have full flights and can spread out and you always have the finest of flight attendants to make sure my seat belt is buckled. You never care about my drink coupons and always hook it up with the Vodka, and you supplied me with about 5 cans of water when I was hungover. Thank you very much for making my delayed flight and horrible sandwich at the airport a lot more enjoyable when flying. Now the fact you have FREE TELEVISION / FLIGHT TRACKER is really doing it big for 2014, you are setting the standard for flight these days. You can watch Tree-house Master for 3 hours and keep checking what city your flying over and the speed the galactic pilot is flying at. I don't even need to buy the Wifi since you have free television now which keeps me entertained for hours. If you complain about babies or kids on flights, I ask you one question: Do you not live in 2014? Have you not heard of "headphones" or "music"? How could anyone fly without headphones.... or gum for that matter. I do not blame you for delays ever, if the pilot doesn't want to fly, am I going to tell the pilot to fly and crash all of us because I had to get somewhere fast, NO I'm not. You do your thing Pilots you are awesome. The landings always make me pray, but other than that, you keep up the great work!
