SO delicious! A hidden gem - honestly, if you're like me and crave pho on the coldest, most blustery nights of winter, this is the place you should go. My boyfriend and I came in here last night for dinner. The place itself is very interesting - half European bar in the front and in the back is a bright and open dining room. Ngoc, the owner (the sweetest and feistiest lady imaginable) was so attentive and funny! She was very gracious and told us about the food, giving suggestions, and joking with us. We decided on four things: Chicken Egg Rolls (Cha Gio Ga) - served in a little boat dish with a delicious sweet chili sauce, these were so tasty! Cevapcici Spring Rolls (Goi Cuon Cevapcici) - this was a suggestion from Ngoc, and she certainly knows her stuff. Two huge spring rolls with beef, veal, veggies, and rice noodles wrapped in rice paper with hoisin sauce for dipping. SO DELICIOUS. And they were big, two is plenty. Rare Beef Noodle Soup (Pho Bo Tai) - my boyfriend had this and said that the beef tasted like it was placed in the broth just seconds before it came to our table. So juicy and so tender! Definitely a winner. Sunset Pho Noodle Soup (Pho Dac Biet - Tai-Nam-Bo Vien-Gan) - I couldn't resist ordering the titular pho. It had rare beef, flank beef, meatball, and tendon as the meats. I've never tried tendon before, and I was pleasantly surprised! It's not grisly or chewy, it's actually quite delicious. I don't know how to explain it but you should definitely try it. The meatballs were great (homemade I assume?) and the rare beef was amazing. The portions are huge, and since I already helped myself to two appetizers, I had to take half of my soup home. All in all, the meal was great and Ngoc made the atmosphere homey and lovely. I will definitely be back - I can't wait to try the beef salad and chicken ginger salad! I'm happy that we found a favorite pho place.
