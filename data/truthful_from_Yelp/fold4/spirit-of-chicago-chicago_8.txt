We had an outstanding experience on board the Spirit of Chicago, during the 4th of July, fireworks/dinner cruise.   Right from the time we stepped on deck, to the time we left, the service was outstanding.  The staff was very friendly and experienced to handle large groups of people in a relatively tight space.   At first I was having some doubts about how the food was going to be since it was being served buffet style.  However my doubts were unfounded for the food ended up being really good.   The wait staff also managed to stay on top of getting drinks to the table and of course if you wish, you can belly up to the bar yourself.     The one item which was a pleasant surprise is the entertainment.  The DJ played a great mix of music and really got the people engaged and making moves on the dance floor.  On the main deck level, there is actually a very cool dance floor and is really a big hit with the kids!   My two daughters spent almost the entire time on the cruise making moves on the dance floor.   By the way, this is a very, "kid tolerant" cruise.   With all this comes a leisurely cruise along the water which offers great views and photo opportunities of the Chicago, skyline.   As for the facilities, the ship was very clean.  Perhaps the only downside is they do tout themselves as a sight seeing cruise, however on the outside decks, there are very few chairs.    There is a lot of standing room, but to me they should have more chairs/benches.   With this being a family, friendly experience, we will sure be back.
