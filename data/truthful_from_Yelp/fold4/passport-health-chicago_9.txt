Headed to Uganda in November and was directed towards Passport health for shots.  Being the skeptic that I am, I had to check things out for myself, so I did all the research, figured out what shots I'd need, called around and priced out a few different places. Then I went to my GP and got the shots she could give me (to save a little money since Passport Health does not take insurance) then reluctantly made my appointment. I say reluctantly because I was certain it would be super expensive.  I needed 3 shots (Typhoid, Yellow Fever, Polio booster) and a few prescriptions (Malaria, antibiotic for "travelers diarrhea") and I was prepared to pay an arm and a leg...lets face it-I DO NOT want to come home with some nasty disease... I got there today at 2 and was asked to fill out a form (typical medical stuff...allergies, etc) and was taken back by Joanne who was incredibly sweet and helpful.  She showed me the packet they had prepared for me with information specific to where and when I'll be traveling.  We went over all the suggested immunizations, and she answered all my questions. After we decided which shots I'd get she went to process my payment and get the shots ready.  I watched a little video recapping health and safety concerns and recommendations.  Then Joanne came back and gave me the 3 injections...pretty painless...I mean, as painless as getting a needle stuck in your arm can be... Start to finish, took about 40 minutes.  And all for $365...not nearly as bad as anticipated!
