Surprised my fiancé yesterday with a helicopter tour with Rotorzen! We were both born and raised in the beautiful city of Chicago, but I guarantee you can never truly appreciate the beauty of the city until you've done so from the seat of Rotorzen's helicopter! Ryan and John were absolutely the best! My fiancé is terrified of flying, but along with John's skillful flying and knowledge of the city, she was absolutely comfortable and enjoyed every minute of the ride. Thanks a lot John and Ryan!
