Anna (the RN) was knowledgeable and had great bedside manner. The prices were fair - Hepatitis A is a two dose vaccine with required wait time in between. I waited much more than the recommended timing, and Michigan Immediate Care (where I got my first dose) told me I had to start over, while Passport Health confirmed I just needed a second dose. Hooray for more travel dollars!
