My girlfriend used Loyalty Limo's services last weekend for her wedding rehersal, after party and the actual wedding. The whole wedding party agreed it was the best limo service we had ever had. Our driver David was always on time, on point and extremely accomodating and helpful. The limo was stocked full of beverages, it was clean and we really enjoyed our time. We all will use Loyalty Limo's services in the future. Worth every penny. I will recommend them in the future to anyone who needs a limo service.
