We had an absolutely wonderful tour of the Indian/Asian neighborhood of Chicago. Our tour guide, Ali, was generous with interesting information and delicious food. We absolutely got much more than we expected. Trying on a sari, getting a henna tattoo, visiting a Sikh temple all were a part of this outstanding tour. The blending of history and culture was great. Take this tour - you won't regret it!
