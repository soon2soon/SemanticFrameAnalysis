It was 10:00 pm on a Sunday. My wife and I were in Lincoln Square scrolling through the Yelp app looking for some Vietnamese food. After a few seconds, we came across Sunset Pho Caffe. I was skeptical of the perfect reviews- but it was 10 pm and we were hungry. Upon arrival, I thought we had the wrong address. Looking through the window, I saw two men sitting at a bar, a bartender, and what appeared to be an Car Auction on the television. My wife and I confirmed that this was indeed the place. Walking in, we were greeted by a very sweet little woman on her way out. She asked if we were there for food. "Yes", I replied. After I realized that this sweet little woman was the owner/chef? I told her I'd come back another time and that she should continue to go home for the night. She wouldn't take that as an answer, and proceeded to seat us in an empty restaurant. I was very glad she did. We ordered a Pork Bun, Beef Pho, and an order of egg rolls. Everything was absolutely fantastic. The pork in the bun was perfectly seasoned and caramelized. The broth in the Pho was very clean and light. The freshly ground black pepper on top completely brought the dish together. It was amazing. I can't wait to return. I'd even go as far as saying that SUNSET PHO CAFFE HAS THE BEST PHO IN CHICAGO. Recommendation: Beef Pho and an order of egg rolls.
