We used Second City Trolley last weekend for a birthday party. We were in need of changing the trolley size more than once. Thomas was more than willing to help us out and meet our changing needs. The experience overall was great. Our driver was very kind and able to take us wherever we wanted to go. The trolley was exactly what we needed: speakers, ipod hook-up, seating, fun lighting, etc. We'll definitely be using Second City Trolley again!
