For sure a 5 start tour company for the Segway's.   Really I mean that!   Damian was our tour guide and he was funny, clear, and totally knowledgeable.   I've lived in Chicago my whole life and he knew so much about the sites he took us around.   We even went over to Soldier Field and rode around that and the gardens of Grant Park.   He was taking pictures for us the whole time and even did a action video with our iphone of us all riding the Segway's.   We only had a group of 4 and was really fun!  None of us had ever been on a Segway and Damian had us up and running in about 20 min with ease.   Damian doesn't rush his tours and makes sure to include you in the tour and not just a dry guy.   Thanks for a great time "Segway experience of Chicago" !
