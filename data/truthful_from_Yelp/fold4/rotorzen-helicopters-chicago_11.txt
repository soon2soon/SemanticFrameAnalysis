WOW! I'm from California and saw a Groupon for Rotorzen and bought one to take my daughter who lives in Chicago, on a surprise Dad-Daughter date. This was a fantastic trip. Ryan and our pilot John were great! The tour was absolutely breathtaking and these two guys were amazing. John was calm (what I needed) and funny (what my daughter needed). If you want a great date idea or just want to see the city from a phenomenal perspective, Rotorzen is your flight team to give you the ride of your life. I will do it again, and my daughter can't wait to get her friends to go for a flight. This is a fun and easily romantic trip for those special moments. Enjoy.
