Right across the Apple store on Michigan Ave is a clear indication you are at THE central location for shopping, restaurants, etc. Perfect for our family of 5 since you have the separate living room and additional TV. I love our 2 drink AM free delivery. Highlights: Great breakfast buffet Free drink delivery in the AM Turn down service Pool 2 blocks from Water Tower, American Girl, & all the famous deep dish competitors. Hop on hop off / discount booth for tickets are also 2 blocks away
