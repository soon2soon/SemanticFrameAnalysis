Can't believe it's taken me this long to write this up (it's been over a year since certification)!  If you've ever been interested in learning SCUBA, this is the place to go.  Rami is the man and is a great teacher.  He's also a really funny guy so that helps make the classwork less boring.   Although he's a funny guy, he's serious about SCUBA and he will make sure you are comfortable and that everyone knows the plan before descending (pool or otherwise).  We did our open water cert through Scuba Sensations and the certification dives were at the Haigh quarry in Kankakee.  It made for a fun weekend hanging out with the other divers and the instructors.  The instructors are all really friendly and fun to hang out with. My wife and I did our first ocean dives in Mexico this past spring and the divemasters said that we were excellently trained and that we should give compliments to our instructors.  We both felt really comfortable and prepared thanks to all the dives, learning and preparation we had done with Scuba Sensations. Thanks guys!
