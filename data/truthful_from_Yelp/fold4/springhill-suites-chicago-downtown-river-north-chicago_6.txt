I would consider this a very good mid-range hotel. The lobby looks newly remodeled. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast includes breads, cereal, eggs, and one meat, as well as a few waffle makers. The breakfast area is quite spacious with seating for probably 75 people. The rooms are clean and nice, although the restroom is a bit cramped with the shower door missing the toilet by less than .25" when you open it. The carpet will need replacing shortly also. My room had a closet for clothes, a few drawers, desk, mini fridge, microwave, king bed, and clock radio with ipod dock. This hotel is in a great location with a two minute walk to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Harry Caray's, Glenn Tavern, and House of Blues.
