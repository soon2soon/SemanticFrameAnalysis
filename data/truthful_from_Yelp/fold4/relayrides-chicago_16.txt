It simply works! You search for a car close to you, you find one that you like and you ask for it. Their website is very clear and once you provide all the documents it is very easy to rent a car. I rented the same car for six months, by renewing the rent month by month. It's easier than buying one because you don't have to worry about insurance, plate, maintenance and re-selling when you need a car for a not so short period of time. I wish we could have a service like this in my country too. Thank you Relay-rides!
