The best pho' we Â have had north of Argyle. Very friendly. The bartender was super helpful. The owner was present and hospitable. You can tell he takes pride in the food. We ordered carryout, but would love to return to dine in. It was the Satuday before Easter and the owner made his mom's cheese pita bread to give to customers. Delicious! The food was amazing, fresh, flavorful, and hot. The place seems clean. Definitely a hidden gem.
