Lufthansa's service is superior to any "American" airline I have experienced internationally...and if you get to travel either on Business of First, you will never think of economy ever again. On demand entertainment, ultra comfortable recliners, excellent wine selection, outstanding food, and awesome desserts. Â And talk about the attention they give you...Kudos. And if you get a chance to hang at their clubs at any of its hub...DO IT!
