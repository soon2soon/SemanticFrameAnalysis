We had our wedding reception aboard the Spirit. In terms of having a wedding in downtown Chicago, it was incredibly affordable. I'm not sure what the boat looked like before its renovation, but everything is beautiful: a light-up dancefloor, stain-free, new chairs and tablecloths. The staff was so attentive. Our servers were never beyond arms reach to refill drinks and help guests. The food is average (no awards will be won here), but no one complained about it. Our DJ didn't play everything we asked him to, but the dancefloor was full all night and everyone raved about the music. Susan, our contact pre-wedding at the Spirit, was quick to email us back about any concerns or requests. She was there the day of to make sure it all was set up the way we wanted. We had a number of special requests that she coordinated flawlessly. To be honest, I was surprised at how well it all went. The dining manager also checked in with us throughout the night to be sure everything was to our liking. If you're going to see Chicago, there's no better way than from the lake. We had amazing views and fireworks on our wedding. We couldn't have asked for more.
