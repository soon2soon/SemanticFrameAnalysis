Wow, I must be really out of the loop because I had never heard of this guy.   I rarely take cabs, but on a random Thursday night we flagged down Ray outside the Handlebar.  We were treated to him singing along to some song about French girls.  Hand clapping was encouraged.  All I kept thinking was "wtf?". Yes, his singing was super entertaining.  And if I had been drunk, I imagine it would have been the time of my life. The five stars is for the clean cab and lack of "so this is how we're going to die" that I get in a typical cab ride.  I think we're going to check out one of his shows, because I'm sure they are really a "show".
