Wtf. Mind blowing. Might be the best pho in the city right now. Front of the house is an eastern European bar...which is totally confusing because they're banging out the Vietnamese truth in the back. Holy Toledo. Argyle better be shaking in their pirate boots right now. Aaaaargyle. Seriously tho folks this spot is the truth. Beautiful people making beautiful food. Go now. Thank me later.
