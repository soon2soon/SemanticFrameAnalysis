This place is great - so much cheaper than Northwestern's travel clinic, and more accommodating with schedules. I had some last minute vaccinations done and they were helpful and not pushy with any of the services or products. Very professional, I highly recommend it! By the way, it's 30 North Michigan, not South, as I learned the hard way.
