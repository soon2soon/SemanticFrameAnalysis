I booked Prime Time Limo for my bachelorette party. They were very flexible, offering point to point service, when many companies were not offering that this time of year (during prom season). Leading up to the event, Pat was very quick to respond via email and always ready to answer any questions I had. The service on the day of the event was unmatched. Pat showed up on time and the limo was in good shape ready to go. Pat made the drop off and pickup simple and easy, texting us when he was 15 minutes away for pickup. As soon as he arrived we went outside and got back in the limo. SUPER easy and seamless. Their prices are VERY reasonable and made is easy to afford a great night on the town. I definitely will be using this company again!! Look no further than Prime Time Limo!
