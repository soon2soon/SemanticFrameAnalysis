While visiting Chicago the other day, I stayed here and I did not regret it. The room were cozy and comfortable, the staff were friendly, and the glazed doughnut shop downstairs has the best doughnuts I have literally ever tasted. Although one thing I don't like is the showers doors, cause their practically is none, just a glass wall. So besides that it was a great hotel and if you are looming for a great hotel in Chicago I highly recommend it.
