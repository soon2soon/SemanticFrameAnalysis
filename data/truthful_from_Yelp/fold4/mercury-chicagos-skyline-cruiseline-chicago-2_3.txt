This is based on the experience I had a couple years back with my dog Cookie on their Canine Cruise. It was the most amazing experience. I've been on cruise throughout the river and lake before but this was such a unique experience since I had my doggie with me. Not only was the crew funny and nice but the other passengers were a blast. Since we're all obviously dog lovers many of us quickly jumped into conversations and played with each others dog. I don't experience that too often in the city. Most people keep to them selves and don't interact with others. We sadly had to put Cookie down a few weeks ago, she was 17 and had CHF, and this is still one of my favorite memories I have of her.*****Thank you Mercury for giving pet owners this kind of opportunity.***** Tips: 1. There is a parking garage right across the street from the river where they load, and don't forget to have them validate your parking pass when you buy a ticket.
