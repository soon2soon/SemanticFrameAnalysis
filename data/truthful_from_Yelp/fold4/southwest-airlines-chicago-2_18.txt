I love Southwest Airlines. It's cheap and relatively hassel free. I recommend buying your tickets online, printing out your boarding pass the morning of, and proceeding directly to the gate, carrying on your bag. SO EASY! Midway can be a bit of a nightmare to get to on public transportation, but once you're there it's all pretty small and simple.
