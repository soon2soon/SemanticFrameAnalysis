I can't tell enough how good the Pho was. I licked the bowl and helped my friend finish his since I have more appetite than him. They have a decent size bar with a variety of liquors to your game day beers. The owners were very friendly and offered us some complementary drinks. Definitely go back every time I am in that area.
