Wake up people!  This is public transportation and it extends far into the south suburbs!  Where else can you receive a weekend pass to take you many miles back and forth, all weekend, for just $7 per person.  I love taking the Metra Electric downtown, to a Bears game or to the campus facilities to enjoy a stroll downtown or to spend more time talking with my companions rather than stressing out on driving downtown, looking for a parking spot and then dreading the ride home after walking around.  The savings on parking alone justifies the $7 per person weekend pass. We are fortunate to have access to this type of reliable and speedy public transportation.  I think more people need to appreciate the simpler things in life.  GREAT JOB TO METRA!
