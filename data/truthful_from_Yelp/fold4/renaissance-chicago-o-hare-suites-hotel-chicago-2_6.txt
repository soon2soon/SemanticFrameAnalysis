Great customer service!!! I went there with my wife for our honey moon...I booked the room online on Hotels.com. I wrote a comment such as "honey moon', fair enough when we got there they gave us a room upgrade. The concierge (Roman) offer us complimentary parking(2 days worth of $50).I recommend this hotel..Very clean,great customer service and great great location!
