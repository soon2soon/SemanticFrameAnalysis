5 days/4 nights in a King Suite on 10th floor, at the end of a hallway.  It was a simply luscious room - with small bathroom off the dining area and ADA accessible in the master suite.  Living room area and wet bar was spacious and useful. Multiple heat/air control units for the suite, windows opened and we were down a very quiet hallway.   Only downside (for us, but could be a bonus to others) was the adjoining door in the bedroom, to the room next door.  Great for families to have three rooms together, however, laying in bed, fresh out of shower and hearing the man-in-the-next-room's cell phone convo as clear as if he was in the same room, was a little unsettling. There was another adjoining door in the living room, to the room on the other side. I was able to use the fitness center, on this visit.  It's is beautiful.  High, glass ceilings, and updated machines in the equipment room. Everything was clean and anyone would be hard pressed to find something lacking in the workout room.  The pool is small and Jacuzzi had too many chemicals to try it, but it was there. The elevators can be a little confusing, as banks of cars only go to certain floors. To get to the executive lounge on 23, we had to take the lift to the lobby and switch cars, or to 8th floor (pool and fitness club) and switch there.  The same to get back to the room, but it was part of the hotel charm.   Breakfast on the executive floor was great.  Not a brunch but plenty of options. I appreciated the hard boiled eggs, as it was about the only protein option. Coffee, tea, sodas, juices and selection of breakfast choices.  It was great.  We will make a point to check out the wine hour in the lounge, next visit. Simply love this hotel!
