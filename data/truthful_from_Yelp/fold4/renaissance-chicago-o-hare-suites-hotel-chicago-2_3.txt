It is a all suites hotel.  This means that you actually have a living space and a sleeping space.   The rooms are big, clean and up to date.   We have stayed here on 4 separate occasions.  It's our first choice hotel when we fly into O'Hare. The blue line "L" stop has a connecting sidewalk to the hotel property.  What that means to us is that we really don't need to rent a car in this city.  Today we are heading to Grant Park via the blue line to enjoy "Taste of Chicago". Lastly, the lobby space is designed perfectly.  It is modern,  vast and there are many interesting things to look at.
