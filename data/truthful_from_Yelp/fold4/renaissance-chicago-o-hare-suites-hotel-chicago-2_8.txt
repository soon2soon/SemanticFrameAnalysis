I think Renaissance Ohare is a wonderful hotel. Â Recently booked a night for my anniversary and I was beyond pleased. The rooms are very up to date, spacious and spotless! They even have sheets to go over the duvets because if you are clean freak like me (and know hotels do not wash comforters) you can appreciate this sort of thing. You can even get a glimpse of the city view from your window without being in the thick of it--which is refreshing. They do have a pool and hot tub which is fabulous. I also love the fact that pool hours do not close until 11pm so you have all day and morning to swim (because pool opens at 6am). In addition, they also have saunas in the locker room so you can steam and relax. If you want to get a good jog in, renaissance has a fitness center to do this. If I had to complain about anything, I'd say the parking for close to 30 bucks is lame. Other than that, I'd definitely stay here again!
