I almost hesitate to write this review because I so desperately want Ray's to stay my own little secret, but this place is just too fantastic to not give it a shout out.  This is hands-down the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Everyone there was sooo nice, the rooms were comfortable, and the breakfast was to die for.  They will bend over backwards to make sure you are comfortable and happy.  It was a level of hospitality that I have never experienced.  You know its a great hotel when you feel like you have to hunt down all the staff to tell them good-bye when you leave :)  Seriously, this B&B would make me want to go back to ANY town, much less Chicago.  BOOK NOW.
