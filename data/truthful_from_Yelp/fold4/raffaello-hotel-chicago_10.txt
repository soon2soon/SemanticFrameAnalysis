My husband and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and were looking for a romantic, fun night downtown. Raffaello Hotel gave us a reasonable rate for a spectacular room. From booking the room, to checking in and out, the staff was extremely nice and helpful. We also got complimentary drink and donut tickets. We really enjoyed our stay! Would definitely stay here again.
