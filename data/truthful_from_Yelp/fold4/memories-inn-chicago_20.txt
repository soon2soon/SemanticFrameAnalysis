This is one fun, crazy little place. It has the most wonderful European style coffee. The cappuccino milk is wonderfully stiff and will have you wondering if you somehow fell down a rabbit hole and landed in the Balkans where they make a proper cup of Joe. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Â You will find a multitude of eastern European languages spoken here and some English, but that is half the fun. This joint has a laid-back vibe and the owner is often there serving drinks, cooking, and participating in general merriment. There is a small dance floor and a DJ booth so after enough libations impromptu dance parties with the most unlikely characters break out. There is food served in the late afternoon and into the evening. I strongly recommend the calamari and the crab cakes. Occasionally, the owner busts out some kind of exotic and hearty food from the old country and feeds the bar. Should you be so lucky to amble in on one of those nights! I totally recommend the plum liquor--Slivovitz. But beware, that medicine will put you down fast! Plan on taking a cab home.
