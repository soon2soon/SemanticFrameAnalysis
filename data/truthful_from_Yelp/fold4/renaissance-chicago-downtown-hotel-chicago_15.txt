LOVE LOVE LOVE This hotel.   Staff was soooo friendly and helpful.  From the bell hop, to the front desk, to the housekeepers.  I got greeted by everyone and with a smile.   They have this wonderful ventilation system that sprayed this light vanilla scent in the public area downstairs.  Lovely! Bar/restaurant served good drinks and great food!   And the hotel is located on the corner of Wacker and State.  Perfect location! I'd stay here again and again!
