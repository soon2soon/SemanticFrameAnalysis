I stayed at Ray's for 5 nights, and I had a great stay. I am from the area and come into town to visit family/ friends, so the location was convenient & overall, it was more personable than a hotel. The breakfasts are generous, amazing, and ended up saving me money on lunch! I love the decor in the main common areas, esp. Ray's photography. Ray and his staff are unbelievably friendly and nice. The atmosphere is comfortable, homey, and there is a lot of info about what to do in the area. I made friends with a number of other guests & enjoyed talking to them over breakfast. I stayed in the Sunlight Room, which was slightly awkward in its layout- being off the kitchen w/ the bathroom downstairs, but it was a comfy room & I got used to the quirks and liked how it was quiet, sunny, and low-key. I *really* liked the whirlpool bathtub. There were cute bars and restaurants in the area, shopping close by, the neighborhood is much safer than it was in the 90s, and I ended up taking the Western Ave. bus a lot which was easy & handy. I would stay here again & hope to for future visits.
