I stayed here for 3 weeks after my condo was flooded. The one bedroom suite was very comfortable - loved the comfy pillows! I had no time for cooking or going out to dinner, so daily breakfast and dinner 4 nights a week was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and made it seem like home away from home. Especially Ismelta in the morning (always there with a smile and a good morning and ready to make you a waffle or get anything else you want) and in the evenings, Heather and Cindy did the same! Attaching pictures of suite, Ismelta cooking waffles at breakfast and Cindy serving beverages at dinner. Thank you for making my stay so nice!
