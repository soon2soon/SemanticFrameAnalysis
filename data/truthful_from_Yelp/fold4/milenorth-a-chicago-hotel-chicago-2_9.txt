The Mile North Hotel is where I booked our room block for our wedding, and let me start by saying that I would give them 6 stars if that were an option.  From the moment I contacted them, they were super accommodating in helping me figure out pricing (which was an awesome deal), how many rooms I needed to book, and showing us around the hotel before we made the decision.  I worked with CaraMarie, who was absolutely wonderful.  She would answer emails within minutes of me emailing her, she helped us with a photo shoot on their beautiful rooftop on our wedding day, and she even left us a sweet note and bottle of wine in our room on our wedding night. On the weekend of our wedding, I had almost every one of my guests tell me that they had amazing service from the front desk, the luggage attendants and the coffee shop/bar area.  Everyone that works there is so helpful and made our wedding weekend run very smoothly, and as a bride this is the most important thing in the world! I have lived in Chicago my whole life and will now recommend this hotel to anyone I know that will be staying downtown.  If you have a wedding room block to book, definitely ask to work with CaraMarie! :-)
