I had a wonderful stay here! The price was really reasonable...parking was expensive, but that is typical in downtown Chicago and it was more reasonable than most other places.  The area is great with many stores, shopping, and restaurants nearby.  It is connected to the Residence Inn & the lobby itself is amazing with plenty of places right inside to eat.  There is a 24 hour kiosk for snacks also...so whatever you need is right there.   The hotel room was spacious and very comfy, with a great view.  I will definitely stay here again.
