I used Loyalty Limo for my wedding two weeks ago and they were amazing! The limo was really nice and clean, they had drinks ready for us to enjoy, and the chauffeur was very professional. He got us to all our photo destinations without any problems and it was completely stress-free. The service was amazing. Vince was awesome and super helpful when I called to book. He was very accommodating and made me feel really comfortable booking with them. I booked the 16 passenger Lincoln Navigator SUV limo and I loved it! If I ever need another limo, I will definitely be calling them again. I've already recommended them to my friends getting married this year :)
