We are devoted National Car Rental fans.  Our Chicago/Midway experience was a good one.  We skipped the rental counter at Midway's new rental car center and followed the Emerald Club signs to the garage.  Once there, we were able to pick out the car of our choice.  Check out is simple, drive to the attendant booth, hand over your driver's license and car's tag, they offered up a map, opened the gate and we were on our way. We got a beautiful silver Malibu with low mileage.  The car was pristine inside, very clean.  Plus, the car got great gas mileage.  We barely had to top off the tank before we returned it. Return was just as simple.  However, a National manager was in the garage, stopped by for a minute to exchange niceties with us.  And the employee printing our receipt took the time to ask us about our National Car experience and then she thanked us for our business.  We always feel good about using National.
