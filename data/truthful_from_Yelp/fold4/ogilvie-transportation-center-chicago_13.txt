If I had to flip a coin to see, in my opinion, which of the two main Metra termini I like best-Ogilvie v. Union Station, that coin would probably continue flipping forever, because I love them both, and have nothing against the other. I equate Union Station with food, because there's a lot of nice eateries there, while I equate Ogilvie with shopping and food. This is more than just a train station, this is a mini-mall. Here, you can find the usual mall stores such as Bath and Body Works, Claire's, Cinnabon, Sbarro, Lids, and GNC, the nutrition store. Recently opened, was a large store that I have yet to venture into and explore, that being Metra Market. You can find out more about this on Metra's website. When I look at all of this, I always think, man, Metra is struggling financially still? This looks like this would be a great solution for the struggling CTA to do-open stores and restaurants at many, if not all, of its rail stations and bus terminals, ALONG WITH RESTROOMS! There are three Metra lines here at OTC, one holding the solidified title as my first Metra line that I rode, the one that goes to Waukegan, and to Kenosha. There's another line that goes to Geneva and to Elburn out in Kane County, and there's the third that goes out to McHenry County. One thing to always keep in mind is the fact that Ogilvie is located inside the Citigroup Center building, not to be confused with the one in the middle of Manhattan, though they may be owned by the same company.
