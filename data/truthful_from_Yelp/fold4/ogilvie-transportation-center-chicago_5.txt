A nice place to relax before getting on any of the Metra lines to the north and northwest suburbs. Plenty of dining options (Panda Express, Jamba Juice, etc.), a couple of bars, and a Hudson News outlet with a decent book, snack, and magazine selection. Purchasing a ticket on my visit was quick and easy. The train platforms are sheltered and there is plenty of security around. It's clean, too!
