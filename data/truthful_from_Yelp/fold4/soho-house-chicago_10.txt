Had a lovely experience here today to kick off my birthday week!  I am not a member so I can't speak to the amenities that entails. However, I can say that it is indeed a lovely space and a great addition to Chicago and the West Loop. This was my first time ever walking into a SoHo House anywhere and I'm happy to see that they've set a great tone in my home city of Chicago with reflecting the people and down to Earth attitude. I asked the valet guy how to get to the Chicken Shop restaurant inside where I was meeting a friend. Instead of just pointing or telling me he actually showed me. So already, this place had me at "hello".  The staff of the Chicken Shop also was warm and welcoming and the food and craft cocktails were great. The lobby area is gorgeous and has a nice vibe as well. Will definitely be back for drinks and to try the other restaurant for sure!   NOTE: The two restaurants inside are indeed open for the public so don't worry if you're not a member.
