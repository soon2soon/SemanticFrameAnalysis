Great location, great staff, easy to everything in the city! Â Mona and Dan were especially terrific. This place is a hidden jem! Parking was surprisingly easy. A lot of little neighborhood places to explore. Only a couple minutes walk to Belmont harbor and the lakeshore. We will definitely be back!
