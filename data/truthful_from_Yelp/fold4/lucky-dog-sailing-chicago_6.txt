Spent a wonderful Sunday afternoon sailing with Lucky Dog.  The boat is unlike any sailboat I have been on:  comfortable (even luxurious), hardwood floors, and two very clean and comfortable bathrooms.  We felt like we were sailing with close friends who happened to own a magnificent sail boat.   One person in our group was worried about getting sea sick; Captain Tom was more than willing to stay inside the breakwall to reduce the wave motion.  Turns out that since the boat is larger than most, the wave motion is moderated.  The winds were strong enough to get us to 7 knots, but the boat was very stable.   We had a great time - I would highly recommend Lucky Dog.
