I ended up at Passport Health after a truly excruciating experience dealing with the sub-par reception desk staff at the Northwestern Travel Cinic.  The vaccinations aren't cheap, but the prices are no more expensive than those received at any doctor's office (and the office visit fees are much cheaper.)  Since my health insurance doesn't cover "non-essential" inoculations, the tab for rabies shots was going to be out of pocket anyway, and I do feel that Passport Health had a lot of added value in their services.  You can also get antibiotic packets for travelers' diarrhea ($10), and that really is a good deal (especially if you have inadequate or no prescription coverage.) The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, and all of my appointments ran right on schedule.  I will definitely be using Passport Health the next time I need shots.
