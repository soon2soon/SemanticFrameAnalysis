We stayed at the Blackstone for a week and loved every minute. From the old fashioned elevators with the clock hand dial to the vintage staircases, the hotel was lovely. We stayed on the 22 floor so used the club floor for breakfast and evening appetizers. Both were amazing. Breakfast had a mix of hot and cold. Evening sported enough "appetizers" to be a meal (hot beef sandwiches etc) Since my boyfriend was conferencing there it was nice to have a quick bite and not feel rushed to eat dinner. They also have a dessert time but we never made it back in time to partake. The location is superb. Across from Grant Park you can walk to the Museum Campus, Art Institute and Millennium Park with ease. If you are looking for transportation I highly recommend the Chicago Hop On Hop Off double decker buses. Grayline has tours also but we rarely saw their vehicles except on the weekend. The Chicago Double Decker buses ran about every 15 minutes. The guides were fun and knowledgable. Â Each one had a story to tell. Go with a multi day pass. You won't regret it or need any other transport. It rocked! The beds at Blackstone were comfy and generous, the bathroom a nice size for downtown. I wasn't fond of the frosted pocket door that lead into the bathroom. It stood out from the wall a few inches and you could easily see the person in the shower if you wanted to. While not a big deal for us, my son was a little thrown by it. The concierge (or navigator as they call it) was helpful. Saturday night before we left we wanted a good steak. He hooked us up with a table at the Chicago Firehouse, which was saying something since we'd heard there wasn't a table to be found due to an art expo. Like a good concierge, he had connections and he used them. Awesome. Everything I would expect in a great hotel. I'd stay here again. Overall it was a great experience.
