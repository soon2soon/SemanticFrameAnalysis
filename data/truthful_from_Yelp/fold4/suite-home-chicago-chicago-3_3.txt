I've been an urban dweller; lived in lofts, warehouses, flats... I was anxious to stay in a Jr. Suite... but what a nice surprise - closets for days, a huge patio, great kitchen with work-island, QUIET setting and huge bedroom - that feels completely separate from the living area... The Tides won my heart... I checked in at 11:00 pm & the Doorman greeted me with a smile and gave me a quick overview of what was where in the building. Even better - the staff and amenities and location (grocery store, Mexican Restaurant and boutique coffee bar, dry cleaners, day care, etc all surrounding the private park... Â perfect for work-live-acclimate to the Windy (it was 70* & sunny my entire trip) City. SHC had the best locations & services for my needs during my transition. ~ Amy (Picky about everything!)
