All the good reviews are true! Excellent accommodations, great staff, yummy breakfast - there wasn't anything I wished Ray's had that it didn't. Â The steam room, sauna, and free water/coffee/tea/pastries were a very nice touch. The location is perfect - on a quiet street, but within walking distance to lots of great bars, restaurants, shops, and public transportation. I'll definitely stay here next time I get the opportunity and would highly recommend it anyone else.
