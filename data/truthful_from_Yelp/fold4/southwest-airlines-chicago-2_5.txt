Southwest Airlines cares about their costumers more than any other domestic airline. My family and I are dedicated Southwest airline flyers. They have exceptional service, competitive prices, a wide variety of destinations, and comfortable planes. The calumniation of all these great attributes makes flying on this airline such a pleasure. I never have had a bad experience on board or working with their costumer service agents. There are never any hidden costs or fees for rescheduling your flight. This makes working with their service reps a dream! I love flying with them too because they have a complimentary Dish TV service that is BYOD. This is a great feature because I can individually and independently choose what I would like to watch during the flight. Opposed to other airlines that play any random movie on the overhead TVs or having to deal with a glitchy touch screen that is in the headrest of the set in front of me. Southwest airlines is the way to fly in the US.
