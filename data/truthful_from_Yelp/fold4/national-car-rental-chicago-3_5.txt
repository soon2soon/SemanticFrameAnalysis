Across the board, wonderful service. The front desk was friendly and helpful. Sometimes I feel that car rental companies try and rip you off by adding extra amenities you don't know you are agreeing to. The people at National did not give me the run around. They were straight forward and friendly. Then we went downstairs to get the car and the guys in the garage were awesome. We told them that we were driving into some rough weather and they actually helped us pick out a car that would perform well in snow. The car was great. No complaints whatsoever. It was clean, it drove well, and it did not slip and slide on the icy roads. I will be booking with National again.
