Jenny S ... Almost the same wave. Thanksgiving Day running late for dinner to a friends house and did the flag down. Jumped into a different dimension... Don't really know if it was a cab or a reality show. The signing cab driver had ask us to pick from three topics. Couldn't figure out which one, so he picked all three. As we fly down LSD... I began to feel like someone had slipped me a fun, but unexpected treat of some sort. It all happened so fast. Even his outfit was looking like he had picked it out to make it even more surreal. I began to giggle thinking to myself. Not, a reason for being a little late. But, how I got there. Who was this cabbie and how did we get the luck of the draw. Things have ways of happening. I will leave it at that. Ray St. Ray. I can not believe you don't have any more reviews bud. Keep it between the lines and always keep a tune in your heart. NOTE: If you have friends in town or family and want to show them something other than the sites, Please give him a call and let him do his thing on the way to an event, game or dinner. It will be a lasting memory, fun and truly eventful. WELL WORTH THE PHONE CALL. Real fun, have him pick up your boss next time.
