RelayRides got it right. I have now rented more than 20x, and I am a very satisfied customer. At this point, I can rent from RelayRides more easily than any rental agency. And even better, they don't put a huge hold on your credit card, and they actually answer the phone when you call. Who does that, these days?? Here's the scary part for the first-time renters: At first, it might seem a little intrusive to require a photo of your license and credit card. But then I realized that's what I would want if I were the owner of the vehicle. And then I also realized this protects the longevity of the service. RelayRides survives on people trusting this relationship. I agree. But perhaps the most important aspect is RelayRides is extremely focused on customer satisfaction. I have owned cars for 25+ years, but only started renting (now that I live downtown Chicago) for the last year. Based on renting from all the standard rental agencies at least two times a week (Hertz, Enterprise, Budget, etc.), I can say this is the most customer-focused agency I have witnessed. Not only do they prioritize feedback (how long does this car-owner typically take to respond? It's all in the first screen...), Â they follow up EVERY TIME. How was the rental? They want to know. Did you return it on time? They ask. And they understand if you informed the owner of unforeseen circumstances. I highly recommend going through RelayRides for your next rental. You get to choose the car. You save money. Your rental goes straight into your neighbor's wallet. This will redefine car rentals.
