We had soooo much fun on this tour!!  We've been to Devon street before but always felt a little unsure about where to eat and shop.  Now we feel like we could  go back and shop and eat with the residents of that neighborhood!   I can't even pick out one favorite thing about the tour - we got to try on traditional clothes, I got a henna tattoo, we visited a Sikh temple and learned about the religion,  explored different shops including a grocery store where we learned a bit about different spices, and we ate so much good food!   Our guide and the owner of the tour is intelligent, fun and excited to share with you all that he knows about the neighborhood and Indian, Pakistani and Persian culture.
