What a great hotel. The lobby is classy, the room was immaculate, housekeeping was quick and not bothersome, and the front desk was incredibly helpful with food and activity suggestions, as well as directions. They also put me on a high floor (14th) overlooking the Chicago River and Willis Tower without even having to ask for it. Perhaps my favorite thing here was the breakfast. I'm a Marriott Platinum member and should have been entitled to executive lounge access. But since the lounge was closed the weekend of my stay, they offered me and my guest breakfast. The fruit, juices and pastries were so fresh, the coffee was excellent, the service prompt, and the dining room elegant. The jacuzzi, pool and steam room were also empty while we were using them so it made for a relaxing experience. No sauna though. :( The location of this hotel is perfect. You're right in downtown in the Loop, the train stop (Salt Lake) is right next to the hotel, and there's a lot to do within walking distance.
