I was here this weekend to take the Kenosha line to see my cousin in Lake Forest. This station is so convenient, clean, friendly and easily accessible. There are a ton of shops: Corner Bakery, GNC, Jamba Juice.... The hour train ride was even great. When this woman was loudly talking on the phone to her father about an infected toe she just got ointment for (not kidding with this) the conductor came over and requested she "lower her voice." I LOVE the Metra.
