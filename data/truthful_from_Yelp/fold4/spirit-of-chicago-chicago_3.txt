We had our amazing wedding reception aboard the Spirit of Chicago, and we couldn't be happier. The staff and food were excellent, my guests all had a fantastic time, and of course the fireworks were unforgettable! The music was a little too loud, but we were on the upper deck, so it wasn't enough to negate the incredible experience. Susan, our coordinator, was more than spectacular. Even though we had a pretty small group, we always felt that we were just as important to her as a much larger group would be. She was always fast to respond to my questions and concerns, and she managed to handle my guest list more than doubling only a month before our wedding date. She even forwarded me a traffic warning about the expressway being closed on our date--this was above and beyond and extremely appreciated by our guests. Thank you to Entertainment Cruises, the Spirit of Chicago staff, and Susan for making my wedding night unforgettable.
