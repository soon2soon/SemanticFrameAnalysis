I stayed here this week on business and was very impressed. First, the location was great, right in front of the old water tower and Water Tower Place. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room had a unique layout with a bathroom that opened up into the room, giving it a nice open feel. The room had a lot of little extras that made it great, from the mending kit and toothpaste, to the electric shoe shine in the closet. All of the fixtures seemed new and top of the line, from the bath tub which allowed me to set the temperature of the water to the motorized shades. The TV in the bathroom was an added bonus to watch the news while I was getting ready in the morning. The conference facility we were at was in the basement, so it lacked windows, but it was very nice. The coffee and espresso machines outside the conference room were nice, and there was a good selection of drinks next to them. The meal we had during our meal was pretty good as well. The only issue I had with the hotel was the lack of a good cell phone signal (I'm on AT&T) in my room. However, the hotel placed a note in my room, warning me the AT&T repeaters in the hotel were under renovation. However, a co-worker (on Verizon) also had difficulties connecting while in the hotel. When I checked out, the front desk said there were charges from the minibar. I told them I looked at the minibar, but didn't take anything. The front desk staff didn't question it and immediately took it off my bill. I'm not sure what the cost was, since it was covered by the business, but I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it.
