My boyfriend and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary on the boat and it was fantastic! The food was delicious, the views were spectacular and the drinks were made perfectly. We wanted a romantic evening and the crew made sure we got it! They would help make your night special, no matter what you're celebrating.
