I lived in nyc for eight years and I've been looking for a place like this to open! Love it. The service is amazing, the bartenders are amazing, thanks Alex and Jason for making both my nites so enjoyable, and the food and it's price are great.  I loved this place so much that I came back the next nite with a friend who also enjoyed the place.  Ate at the chicken shop and the lounge area downstairs was beautiful.  I don't understand why people are complaining. People there were not racist towards this Asian, and I'm not dumb enough to enter a place 15 minutes before they close and feel entitled for a whole restaurant to stay open even though these poor blokes worked all day.  These people and this place...amazing. I live in the west loop and this will be my go to place.
