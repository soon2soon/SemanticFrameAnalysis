Great location. Swanky hotel. Rooms are great size, the one I'm sitting in now is 550sq ft. We found this on the hotel tonight app and very happy that we decided to give it a try. The lounge area on the 1st floor and check-in area are worth a visit. The rooms are not luxurious, but instead they have this unique look that make you feel like you're in a mad men episode. I highly recommend getting a room with a king size bed and city view, it is a nice upgrade from the queen size bed room.
