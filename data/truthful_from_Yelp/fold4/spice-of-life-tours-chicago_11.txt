What a great experience! I have lived in Chicago for 8 years but never been to Devon ave because I had no idea where to go or what I would order when I got there. All that is changed now. We tasted (lots of) foods and spices from different regions of India, played a traditional Indian board game, got henna tattoos, tried on saris, visited a Sikh temple, and learned the right way to eat a number of delicious snack items. Our wonderful tour guide took us to the best of the best Devon has to offer and provided a lot of insight into the history and traditions. This tour is definitely worth your time and money!
