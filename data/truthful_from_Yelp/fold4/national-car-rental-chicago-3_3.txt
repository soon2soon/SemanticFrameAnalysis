National Car Rental is my favorite car rental company because I love their rewards program, and this downtown location is exceptional. Front desk and garage pickup are super nice. Â Several times they have upgraded me to a better car because I was taking far trips to Springfield IL and another one to Bloomington IL and the road conditions were not that great. Yes, I am that lady that loves the Chrysler 300. You guys rock! and I appreciate your help.
