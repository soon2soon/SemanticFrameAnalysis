We were on the Lucky Dog Sailing charter on 7/19/09.  Captain Tom and his wife Kristi were very professional and super friendly.  After meeting at Belmont Harbor, we sailed South along the lakefront and caught some beautiful views of the skyline from a perspective we haven't seen before.  After turning in Burnham Harbor, we headed back North a little farther from shore.  The captain is an experienced sailor on Lake Michigan as well as the Caribbean.  They took great pictures of my girlfriend and I with the skyline in the background and were nice enough to email us the pics! The sailboat was brand new and beautiful... 41 feet long with a full kitchen to store any food/drinks that you may bring along for your charter.  It actually wasn't that windy that day, so the engine was used a little bit more than we would have liked, but it was still a great time and I would recommend Lucky Dog Sailing to anyone who wants to try something new and see our beautiful city from out on the Lake Michigan.
