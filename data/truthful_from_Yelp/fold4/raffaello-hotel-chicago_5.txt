My boyfriend, best friend and I all traveled to Chicago for our spring break and stayed in Hotel Raffaello. This was a wonderful hotel and we enjoyed our stay. The staff at the hotel was very nice and were able to assist with everything we needed. The only thing I didn't like was the $300 holding charge I had to put on my debit card, but I think this can be avoided if you have a credit card. The price of Â this hotel was great for the location. The hotel is right next to the John Hancock Observatory and only a block away from the shopping on the magnificent mile. It is also only a few blocks from the train and there is a grocery store right down the street. If we return to Chicago we will stay here again!
