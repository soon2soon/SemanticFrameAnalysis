I'm in love... Believe when I say I never want to use another to fly with. They never lose my bags! I worry about that the most when I fly. But you can trust SWA. Â (I do.) The new planes have so much leg room. You can depend on the staff to be polite kind and helpful oh and professional. So I'm a chicken I'm always scared to fly. But I relax myself by saying (chill u on a southwest flight) Then I just put on my headphones and nap. I don't know what other airlines are like and to be blunt I just don't care SWA has me spoiled and I will NOT fly with anyone else.
