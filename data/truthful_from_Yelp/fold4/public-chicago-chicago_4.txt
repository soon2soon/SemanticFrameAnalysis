This hotel was beautiful, and so much more than I expected. Everything about the place was just awesome, their staff were warm and inviting and after a long day of travel their sweetness was much-needed. Â The art direction of the rooms are incredible. Incredibly clean, and comfortable rooms with lovely amenities. Everything feels modern, but still appreciating the architecture of the building. My favorite part of my stay at Public was borrowing a complimentary trek bike and exploring the neighborhood.
