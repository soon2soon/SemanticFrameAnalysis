Anchors Aweigh my boys Anchors Aweigh...(song) The service, impeccable, the food, phenomenal, the ride, soooo smooth. It doesn't get much better than this on a three hour tour. I took my mom on this dinner cruise for her birthday, and she loved it. They treated me well, but they treated her like she was a celebrity. They wrote happy birthday in chocolate on her desert plate. It was very cool. If you have a chance to dine on this fantastic ship, do so. Every Wednesday and Saturday night during the summer, you get to see fireworks around 10PM on Navy Pier. So, if you dine on the Odyssey on one of these nights, that's an added bonus. I have no complaints about this dinner cruise.
