If ever any one of us mortals was born to teach scuba, it would be Rami Hatamleh.   I completed my Open Water diving class and certification dives with Rami last Fall and have no doubt that both experiences were as comprehensive, well-paced and fun as a novice diver is likely to have anywhere.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I signed up for his Advanced Open Water Diving class and we are headed to the Florida Keys next month.   Scuba Sensations is an intimate dive shop whose brightly-colored decor reflects Rami's infectuous enthusiasm for scuba diving.  Ample street parking in a quiet neighborhood make it easy to stop by and pick his brain or just share a laugh or two.  Do it.
