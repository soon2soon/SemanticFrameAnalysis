Absolutely marvelous service. Stayed here when on a business trip and services was prompt and personnel are all very nice. Rooms are pricey but in line with downtown Chicago hotels, and you get good quality for what you pay. I got in late on a Sunday night and order room service around 10:15pm. The food didn't show up until 11:15, turns out the overnight cook never showed up for work. They brought me the food and told me it's on the house. I wasnt expecting it and definitely appreciated it. Room is nice and spacious, and I liked the little hallway that shields the bed from direct view of the door. The gym facilities are impressive, a full blown gym with more bosu balls, kettle bells and weights than I see at other gym facilities you pay for. They also have an outdoor running track, pool and Jacuzzi on their roof top deck which due to the weather I chose not to utilize but did look cool. I'll be making this my hotel of choice next time I'm back in the area.
