Rode Metra for the 1st time this past weekend, and what word can I use to describe how I feel about riding trains back and forth with my weekend pass? LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I really loved it! It was worth waking up at 3:30 in the morning on Saturday for! I love how clean and quiet the trains are! I love how on time they always are! I love how the conductors and personnel on board the trains ask to see every rider's ticket, something that CTA doesn't do and should. I love the clean, comfortable seating! I love the speeds that the trains travel at! Everything else about Metra I love! Come the middle of April, I'm purchasing another CTA/Pace pass and another Metra weekend pass so I can ride Metra trains back and forth for the fun of it! Hehehehe XD Come on April!
