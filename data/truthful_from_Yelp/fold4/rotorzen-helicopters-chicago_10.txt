My boyfriend surprised me for our three year anniversary with a helicopter ride over the city through Rotorzen Helicopters. IT WAS AMAZING. 5 STARS 1. Great service (we were 15 min late but they were more than accommodating and understanding).   2. Great pilot Our pilot, John, was charismatic and talked just the right amount. He's been flying for years and this is his side job (how awesome, i need to find a cool hobby like this). Our flight was smooth and he even did a few tricks for us! 3. Easy reservations and planning The bf said that planning the event was hassle-free and convenient (he was armed with a groupon). He worked with a guy named Ryan. When we arrived, Ryan was very polite and informative (he explains the safety instructions before you board the helicopter). Don't let one person's perspective deter you from trying this place out because I'm glad my bf didn't.   Not a lot of ppl can say they have ridden a helicopter over the city at night. IT'S BREATHTAKING and super romantic! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM! Thanks Rotorzen for making our 3 year anniverary so amazing!
