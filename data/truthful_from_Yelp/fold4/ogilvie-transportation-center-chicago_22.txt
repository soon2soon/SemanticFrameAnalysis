Ogilvie has spoiled me. During my tween and teen years, this large, clean, well-organized train station was what I associated with public transportation - it was always, for me, a heavenly gateway between the suburbs and the city. Then I moved to Chicago and BAM - rude awakening as I became initiated to the harsh world of the CTA. Ogilvie has everything that the everyday commuter or the weary, naive subrubanite or out-of-towner could ever want: a huge food court with plenty of seating and everything from McDonalds to Corner Bakery to a French Market on the lower level; great stores to pass the time in, like Borders, Bath & Body Works, and Claire's; not one but two bars; and even a nail salon and a barber shop. Let's not forget Starbucks, Caribou, Jamba Juice, Dunkin Donuts (two of them), CVS, etc etc etc... The only negative (though not worth deducting a star) is that when you exit Ogilvie, you have to try and avoid the dudes right outside who will try to hail you a cab - they'll expect a tip, and they don't deserve it. Decline and tell them you'll catch your own cab!
