I'm not a fancy person...I usually stay in youth hostels. And what I've seen of Milwaukee's best hotels is kind of dismal compared to this simple one in Chicago. The service honestly couldn't have been better...just as an example, when I asked the front desk for some more coffee for our room, I barely beat the delivery boy up to my room. The complimentary breakfast was one of the best I've had. The room was spacious, lovely, and clean. And the lobby had a Wii :o)
