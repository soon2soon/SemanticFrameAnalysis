Both of my experiences with relay rides were outstanding and I would definitely recommend and use them again & again for all my out of town trips. I rented a minivan from the same owner twice in a 2 month span she had the tank filled and ready to go when I picked it up. It ran beautifully and was kept in pretty immaculate condition. Surpassing the lines, the per mile additional cost and hefty deposit made it all worth it for me. Great find!!!
