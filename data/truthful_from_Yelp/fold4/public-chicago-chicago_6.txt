We had a wonderful stay for our wedding weekend. I want to thank Megan and her team for making all of our guests and ourselves so welcomed and comfortable. From the check in to out all of the staff were friendly and helpful. The Bellafonte suite was the perfect wedding suite for us. The boys were hanging in one room while the girls got ready in the main room. Check out the Pump Room too! Delicious!
