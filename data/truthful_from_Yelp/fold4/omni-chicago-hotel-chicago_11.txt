Okay so here's the scoop.  We stayed here for a short business trip. Check in was a breeze I think maybe the quickest check in ever which is great after a long flight.  But I wanted to write this review for an employee who went out of her way and went above and beyond.  During the afternoon I was craving a chocolate chip cookie.  I must have looked lost as I was trying to find anywhere in the hotel that had snacks. Dena an employee asked if she could help me and I have no idea what prompted me to even ask her since it's probably the most trivial request ever, but I asked if she knew where I could get a chocolate chip cookie.  She said she would get some made and send them to my room.  When I returned, she had delivered them with milk and a sweet note.  Definitely worth some recognition. Thanks again!!
