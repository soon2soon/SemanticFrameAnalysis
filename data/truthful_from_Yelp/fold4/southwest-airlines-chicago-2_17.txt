I am flying to San Diego in early November to run in, and raise money for, the Challenged Athletes Foundation Half-Iron Distance Triathlon (message me if you'd like to contribute to the foundation which provides prosthetic limbs for amputees and people born without limbs).  I am trying to keep travel expenses to a minimum, and Southwest Airlines definitely is helping me to do so.  I had many flights from which to choose in both directions for $99 each way, nonstop.  I don't mind the first-come-first-serve seating, as I am usually early everywhere I go!  I was also able to secure a rental car for a very reasonable price when I booked my flight on-line.
