My husband and I used PUBLIC for our guest wedding block, bridal suite and first look location.  We could not have been happier with our choice!!  As we were married at the Nature Museum, I initially looked into another boutique hotel, also on the lake with a rooftop bar.  Unfortunately, that other hotel was incredibly difficult to deal with, hard to get a hold of, and had a crazy quota we had to meet in order to get a block rate. We went with PUBLIC and are so glad we did!  Jaclyn Cosantino was a pleasure to work with, and answered all of our emails and calls promptly.  There were no crazy quotas for a room block, no minimum number of nights required, and we did not have to secure anything with our own credit card. We booked a deluxe 1 bedroom suite for ourselves and had 15 additional rooms of friends and family.  Every single person that stayed there raved about the beautiful rooms and excellent service.  On Friday night after our rehearsal dinner Jaclyn reserved some tables/couches for us in the Library Bar and it was a fabulous location to have everyone meet us for a pre-wedding drink.  Jaclyn had the staff open up the Ava on the 17th floor for us to use for our first look, and was incredibly gracious in doing so.  On Saturday night my husband and I returned to our suite to find a chilled complimentary bottle of Prosecco, and an additional mini-fridge had been brought into the room so our leftover 'getting ready food' could be stored. The service was truly top notch from start to finish.  We experienced everything from valet to room service and did not meet a single unfriendly staff member.   I will be recommending the hotel to anyone and everyone who needs a hotel in Chicago.  What a wonderful location to help make our wedding weekend the special event that it was!
