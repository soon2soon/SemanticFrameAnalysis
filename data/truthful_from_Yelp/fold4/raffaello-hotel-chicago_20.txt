This cute little boutique hotel truly has it all!  I stayed here on a Friday night and it was magnificent.  The decor was very elegant, the rooms were cozy and warm with nice modern clean furnishings.  The bathroom was spacious with an awesome shower!!!  The amenities that the room included were a mini fridge, microwave, and a 32" flat LCD TV. Location, location, location!  This hotel was perfectly situated for our stay.  It is only a block from Michigan Avenue, right behind the Hancock Tower, so it was close to all the dining and shopping, and close enough to walk to Rush & Division to party it up.   Our rate here on a Friday night for a room with double beds based on 2 person occupancy, was $125 without taxes.  OMG!!!  I don't think you can get a room at Holiday Inn at that rate or if you could, why would you?  So basically, if a Chevy Nova and a Beemer cost the same thing, what would you pick.  Exactly.   If I ever need a place to stay in the city, I would put this place on the top of my list!
