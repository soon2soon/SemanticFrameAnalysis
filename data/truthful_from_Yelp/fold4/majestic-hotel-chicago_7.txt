The friendly staff literally saved my husband and I as we were desperately in need of a room and they made sure that we were accommodated even though they were all booked up!! Called other hotels and just as we were about to leave they had a cancellation and stopped us. They were so nice!! The room was...cozy to say the least, but the location was perfect and the cookies were a nice touch!! We will definitely stay here again!!
