Absolutely wonderful experience. The boat is gorgeous and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend and I took the 3 hour dinner cruise. 3 hours was a little on the long side but we still really enjoyed ourselves. The food and cocktails were also very good. The only down side is that it's not very intimate. Your pretty much sitting RIGHT next to other people. But your on a boat so guess you can't expect much more. I would definitely recommend for a special event!
