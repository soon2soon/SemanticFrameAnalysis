Love this hotel.  Fantastic location, outstanding customer service and the rooms are very nice.  Good use of space, nice desk area and good lighting. The pool and fitness center are excellent.   I met an incredibly friendly and enthusiastic maintenance man who was like an ambassador for this hotel and provided useful information about the area.  And the housekeeper was equally awesome. A Lou Malnati's is within easy walking distance.  Perfect! I ended up here because the hotel where I usually stay accidentally cancelled my reservation for the week.  I love SpringHill Suites so much more than the other hotel, I should send them a thank you card for accidentally canceling my reservation.  Otherwise I never would have "discovered" SpringHill Suites. Definitely plan to stay here for all my future trips.
