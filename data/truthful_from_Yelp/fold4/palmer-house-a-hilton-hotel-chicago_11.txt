This hotel is gorgeous! The lobby is one of the most beautiful lobbies I have ever seen. It's quaint and historic. The location is great. We walked to Cloud Gate (the Bean) and the Art Institute. Many restaurants are nearby and catching a cab is easy. The rooms were small but very "cute." The bar here had one of the best cheese plates I have ever had. I've looked for the fennel gouda numerous times since and cannot find it anywhere. I'd definitely look to stay here when I return to Chicago!
