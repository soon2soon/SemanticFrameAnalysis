My husband and I chose Seadog before we got to Chicago. It turned out to be the perfect choice! Boarding was easy and on time. Our guide Elliott was funny and informative. We learned a ton of history about the city in addition to learning about the architecture and history of the buildings around us. During our tour there were a few out of their control things that happened, (lock hold up, Â water bridge turning on and sailboat traffic), but Elliott kept going and let us ask questions about the city. I would highly recommend Seadog to anyone traveling to the Chicago area and we can't say enough wonderful things about Elliott. We did many things while in Chi and this was by far our favorite!
