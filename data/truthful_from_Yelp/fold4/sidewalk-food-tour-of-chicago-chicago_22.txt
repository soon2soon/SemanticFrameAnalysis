After living in Chicago for over two years now, I consider myself somewhat of a local and one of my favorite pastimes is going out to eat-- so I've been to a LOT of Chicago restaurants. However, this fantastic tour of the River North neighborhood exposed me to a wealth of more great Chicago food, some of which I would've never gotten around to trying on my own. The staples are here-- deep dish pizza and Italian beef from the greats-- but some hidden gems really stood out and deviated from typical tourist fare. Your sweet tooth will be satisfied as well, and there's even an opportunity for some afternoon libations. I'm a pescetarian and they were easily able to accommodate my diet (as long as you give prior notice). Jake, our tour guide, made the experience exceptional-- he's personable, funny, and a huge fan of Chicago food (he also works in a local restaurant, so he knows his stuff). Overall, both tourists and locals alike will have a lovely time meeting new people, restaurant-hopping, and (re-)discovering local flavors.
