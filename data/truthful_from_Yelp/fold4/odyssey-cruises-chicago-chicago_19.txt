What a great experience, and the staff/crew made you feel special from the moment we boarded.  Took the Saturday afternoon lunch cruise, celebrating my sister's birthday, and our waitress (Asia) was the best!  The duck confit appetizer and lobster bisque were outstanding.  And the salmon was moist ad flavorful. The two-man band played many hits, and sounded quite good!  We're returning for a brunch cruise in October - nice job!
