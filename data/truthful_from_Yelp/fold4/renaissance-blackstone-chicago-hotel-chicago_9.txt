The Blackstone has hit that magic mark of an historic hotel that still has many of the antique touches, but has been thoughtfully updated for modern needs and tastes. The lobby is incredibly classic and pleasing. The ROOMS: I got very lucky as a Marriott gold and was upgraded to the concierge floor. Just a beautiful incredibly spacious rooms. The views from the 22nd floor were great looking out on the park and a bit on the lake. The windows are a bit oddly shaped, but that's from the historic nature of the building. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom was very spacious. Some quite nice details including lots of power outlets and a nice chest of drawers with hangers for getting ready. The SERVICE was always friendly and professional. No complaints there at all. The LOCATION is excellent. You're right on Michigan avenue. It's across the street from Grant Park and right in the loop. Easy access to shopping, museums, and the subway/train network. Overall, I'm completely thrilled with my experience and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
