Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from the Chicago Architecture Boat Tour beyond a lazy jaunt down the river with a cheesy college kid half-assing the tour guide duties. I was wrong! The tour guide was incredibly knowledgable about the history and structural details behind all of Chicago's most famous and beautiful buildings. The last time I thought about architecture this much was when I read The Fountainhead for school. I found so much of the history and politics behind the buildings to be so fascinating and I have a newfound appreciation for the significance of the architectural details I never really noticed before on the various skyscrapers. I was a little dubious of the price at first ($40), but after the your, I definitely think it was worth the price. There simply is no better way to see this amazing city than by boat. I would not hesitate to take the tour again in the future. Tip: if you have a problem with seasickness (like me), grab a seat in the middle of the boat if you can.
