Suite Home Chicago is great!  Jenn (President) goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied while staying with Suite Home (always responds very promptly).  The rates are cheaper than staying at a hotel for an extended period of time and the units are modern and kept very clean (nicer than many upscale hotels).  If you are looking for temporary or corporate housing Suite Home is definitely the way to go!
