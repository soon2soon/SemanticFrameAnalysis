Pretty much perfect. I paid ahead of time online. I arrived at the gate and was told which aisle to go to. There was the shuttle bus waiting there and the driver pointing which space to park in. He was very friendly and took my bags and put them on the shuttle - he then gave me a ticket with instructions on what to do upon return. I got on the shuttle and we waited a few more minutes for a couple of other cars and then were swiftly driven to the airport. On return after I picked up my bags from the baggage claim, I texted them according to the ticket the first driver gave me. I looked outside and the shuttle just happened to be waiting. Driver was friendly and took my ticket and bags. I was not looking forward to cleaning the snow off my car as it had snowed while I was away. He drove right up to my car, brought my bags out and as I was loading them - he cleaned the snow off my car!!!
