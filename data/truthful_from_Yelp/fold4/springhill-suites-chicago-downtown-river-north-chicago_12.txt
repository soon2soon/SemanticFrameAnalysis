Just arrived at Springhill Suites. Couldn't find a decent room in all of Chicago for under $300.  Everything was booked. Stumbled upon this hotel and booked a Corner King for $189 (June in Chicago). Lobby is nice and modern and clean and packed with friendly outgoing people (Like most are in Chicago).   There is no bar, but you can buy beer and sodas in the lobby. There is also only ice in the lobby in bags, so make sure to grab one every trip. The room is awesome.  Clean and modern corner King with a great couch, flat panel TV, wireless and wired internet. Plus it is new.  I always prefer a new hotel. Close to CTA lines also.
