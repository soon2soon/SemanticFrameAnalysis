Great 75 minute tour! My friend and I got the Go Chicago Card, which included the option to take an architectural boat tour through Shoreline Sightseeing. Easy to spot the ticket booth once you get to Navy Pier since the staff wears neon orange shirts. Our tour guide, Sarah, was fantastic! Great sense of humor and very informative. I enjoyed every bit of it! DO arrive early if you want a good seat on the sides or the front. The rows of benches filled up fast with lots of people saving seats for other people. Oh yeah... the boat includes a bar if you're thirsty! ;D (With bathrooms on deck!)
