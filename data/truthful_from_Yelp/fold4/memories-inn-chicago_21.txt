I had an opportunity to check out this new venue. It has an extremely comfortable, warm ambiance with delicious health conscious food. The menu prices are exceptional, and Quench provides an opportunity to have a great time, with great people, while eating healthy without even thinking about it. I had a fantastic time, the food was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be back! A hidden gem indeed!
