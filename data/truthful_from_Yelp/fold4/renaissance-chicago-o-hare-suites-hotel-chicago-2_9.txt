Gorgeous hotel. Very friendly staff. Located conveniently near O"hare & there is a free shuttle that will take you there and anywhere within 5 miles-- & will pick you back up. Blue Line is so conveniently close, not even 2 blocks away. Decor is beautiful, very large stand up shower was nice. Bed was VERY COMFY and I appreciated the Aveda products they provided (and replenish every day, and don't be afraid to ask for more). Nice view. Jacuzzi was perfectly hot and nice and large. Big spool, and sauna even bigger than hotels usually have. Bathroom's nice and clean and there is plenty towels ready for you to grab. Nice view from the room too. I really loved this hotel and will definitely go back! Conveniently located near restaurants and things to do. No complaints here!
