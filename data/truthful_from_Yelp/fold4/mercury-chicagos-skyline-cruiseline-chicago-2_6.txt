This review is solely for the canine cruise which takes place every Sunday morning during the summer. My precious pooch, who passed away 6 weeks ago, loved going on the canine cruise. We had gone every year for the past 5, and he had the best time sticking his head over the side of the boat, sniffing the air, enjoying the breeze, not to mention the seemingly endless supply of dog biscuits from the tour guide. If you enjoy architecture, or just a wonderful boat ride with amazing views of our world-class skyline, then I highly recommend this excursion. It's a relaxing way to start off a Sunday morning. Sadly, I knew somehow that last year would probably be my dog's last cruise so I made sure to burn every detail into my memory.Five stars alone for the wonderful memories I will cherish of the canine cruise with my best pal.
