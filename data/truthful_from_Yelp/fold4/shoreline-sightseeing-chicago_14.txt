As a native Chicagoan, this is a great way to give your tourist guests a great taste of Chicago! Shoreline offers great/affordable prices, different boat tours and flexible time schedules to be able to choose a day and time that will work for you. My cousin came in from Florida back in May and we took a classic lake tour. Beautiful view of the city off of Lake Michigan! They also offer the Architectural River Tour which is a great way of seeing the architectural history of the city. Great prices for great tours. This is a definite must if your in the city!
