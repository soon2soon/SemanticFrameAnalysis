I have taken two or three tour river and lake cruises so I am very familiar with these tours.  Awhile ago, I had found a great deal on Groupon.com so I thought what the heck.  What a great find. I had called Sunday evening for a Monday's tour.  They had availability for the 12:15pm tour so I grabbed it.  The customer service agent emailed me the confirmation for the tour.  So booking the tour is very painless. I had to pick up the actual ticket at ticket counter and then proceed to step into the entry line for the tour.  Due to open seating, arrive early.  I'm glad that I was able to sit next to the railing.  Beware, if it a hot day, the seats are a "little warm" when you first sit down.   The tour begins with a quick open ride on the lake.  The boat's captain does open the throttle a bit; up to 30-40 mph which was fun.  Then we proceed to go through the locks to begin the tour on the river.  Grant, the tour guide, who was fantastic.  He would point out various buildings as well as the history or the importance of the building.  Once the Sears Tower is pointed out, the boat will start the second part of the tour - heading back to the lake, including through the locks.  Once the boat reaches the open waters, the boat will again increase the speed boat again.   The 75 minute cruise was well the cost.  It's a great way to see the city by the water ways.  I would highly recommend this tour. I'm looking forward trying the Extreme Speed Boat tour.
