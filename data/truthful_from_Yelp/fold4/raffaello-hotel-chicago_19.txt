I did not stay at the hotel, but my parents stayed there and happened to be celebrating their 42nd wedding anniversary.  I wanted to do something to surprise them, so I originally called to upgrade their room, but they had already checked in. I called the front desk, who transferred me to the concierge, who was AMAZING!  He took my credit card number, went across the street, and hooked my parents up with bourbon (for my pops), wine (for moms) and Godiva chocolates, flowers, etc- all within the budget I had asked him to adhere to.  He put together an amazing presentation for my parents, and saved me a TON of money by going across the street- the same wine and liquor purchased at the hotel would have cost me over $100 more. I truly appreciated his willingness to drop everything and go the extra mile to ensure that my parents felt super special.   And his consistent communication made me feel like I was a part of the surprise.  And A+ experience all around
