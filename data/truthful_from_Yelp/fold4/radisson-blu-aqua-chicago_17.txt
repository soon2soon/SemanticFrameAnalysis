Just the best hotel I've ever been to !! The building is amazing ! The hall is very impressive !! The hotel is near everything (Transports, stores, attractions, bike, etc...) ! The rooms are just crazily beautiful and smell very good !! Also the best is the lounge !! Drinks and (good) food for free (business class) ! They have swimming pools (indoor/outdoor), jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, basketball field, gym, billiard, computers (iMacs and PC). They also have a luggages room if you come earlier. Thank you so much for everything. Special thanks to Pierre-Louis Giacotto, Chantal Bonnaure and Teddy Findling !
