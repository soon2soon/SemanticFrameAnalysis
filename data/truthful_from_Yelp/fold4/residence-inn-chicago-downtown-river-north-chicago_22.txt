What a great hotel and what a great location.  River North Chicago is a great area and has pretty much anything you want.  Great restaurants and plenty of shopping.  My wife, son and I just spent 12 days and loved the hotel, the staff and the place. The hotel was about a 10 minute walk for work for me each way, not bad at all.  About a mile from Navy Pier and the Lakeshore Trail for those that want to visit either of those.  A little further away if you are trying to visit Shedd Aquarium or the Field Museum but take the CTA or dive if you have a car (parking is in a connected lot about $40 per day). I think it was on 4Square I saw a tip to make sure you have a higher floor or you spend the entire time looking into an office window or the parking deck.  (The construction going on next door provided endless amazement to our 3 year old.) Rooms were clean, housekeeping was great, the staff was amazing One other great thing here is the ability to select a weeks worth of free internet so instead of each night having to re-login in the middle of something, you only have to do it for a week. WIll definitely go back to this hotel and recommend it to friends.
