Came to Chicago for my cousin's wedding.  Neil was waiting for us when our flight arrived late.  Nice, clean mini-van.  Stocked with water bottles which we really appreciated. Pleasant ride into town even during peak traffic.  Neil picked us up promptly at 11:30 at our hotel Sunday for our return trip.  I would definitely book Neil's service again when I visit Chicago!
