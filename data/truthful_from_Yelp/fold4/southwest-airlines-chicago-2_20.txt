Southwest decided to step up to the plate and fix the problem. I filed a formal complaint with their office baggage office last week. The complaint detailed the pictures of the destruction to my luggage and belongings and a description of the incident. Today i received a call from a very nice lady who apologized for everything and treated me with the great respect I had become accustomed to with this airline. She actually understood the problem and felt my pain. Then the company offered to reimburse for the damage and provided a flight voucher for my troubles. I would like to say thanks for showing the truly great customer service that Southwest is known for.
