Excellent Service from the door attendants to house keeping! Stayed there for 4 nights during a ASHA Convention and couldn't have chosen a better place! They have, by far, the best bedding set I have ever slept on! Really felt like clouds! Made me an instant fan of down comforters! I didn't even want to leave the room, just wanted to lay in bed the entire time.
