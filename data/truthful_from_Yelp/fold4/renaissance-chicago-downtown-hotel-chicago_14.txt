As a Marriott Platinum Elite Member for the last 5 years, I've gotten just a little picky about the Marriotts I stay at and of course, the level of service and atmosphere they provide.  During a recent stay in Chicago, I chose to return to the Renaissance Downtown due to a wonderful past experience and its stellar location.  I was elated to again experience a consistency in the superb quality of service this hotel provides.  I immediately received an upgrade when requested at check-in and settled into a lovely, clean and spacious room that provided picturesque views of the city and overlooked the Chicago River.  Fabulous!  Their bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large but also memorable were the numerous outlets near the desk, bedstands and throughout the room for your iPhone, iPad and laptop chargers (a working executive's dream!).  The Concierge Lounge was closed Friday-Sunday, so we received vouchers for a delightful free buffet breakfast every morning at Great Street, their restaurant on the 2nd floor.  It offered numerous hot and cold breakfast items and an entire restaurant staff that was impeccably prompt and attentive in service.  You can also walk into Bar Novo from the lobby of the hotel, which is a cool hip place to enjoy happy hour with work colleagues or cocktails and appetizers with friends over the weekend. I absolutely loved the fact that I chose to return to the Renaissance Chicago.  Either if I'm dressed in my business suit or a casual sweater and jeans, the Renaissance provides a versatile atmosphere and vibe that aligns to both the classic professional and the playful fun side of me.
