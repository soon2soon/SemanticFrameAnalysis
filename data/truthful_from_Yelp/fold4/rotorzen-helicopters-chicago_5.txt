What an awesome experience, will definitely do again! Bought a Groupon and took my Ma up for her birthday with my sister. I've lived in Chicago all my life and have seen everything a million times, but never from this point of view. Ryan, down on the ground, was helpful and nice and reassuring, while John, in the air, was cool and funny and knowledgeable. Great team. The ride itself was amazing. We went out at 7pm and got some pictures that put the expensive skyline shots in stores to shame. I posted some here too, so check them out. Will definitely go back to get the nighttime effect, but daytime views were badass.
