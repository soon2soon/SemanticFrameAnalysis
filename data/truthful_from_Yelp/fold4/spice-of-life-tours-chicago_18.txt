WOW!!!!! great tour. I have eaten on Devon before but this tour gave me so knowledge of Indian & Pakistani food which I have never known. As a foodie it was all interesting. I never knew there's a restaurant on Devon which sell organic food. Not just there's plenty of food on this tour there's a good variety of it. Also, you'll learn a lot about culture and indian spices. Its worth every penny of it. Even though its not a private tour but Mr. Ali will answer all your questions in right amount of details.
