This was an experience I am not soon to forget.  I set up a helicopter tour for me and my wife's 10-year anniversary.  Neither of us had ever been in a helicopter before.  After a quick safety check inside, we waited about ten minutes while the pilot prepared for the flight and then we were escorted out to the helicopter.  It didn't take long after we lifted off to feel the effects of the turbulence.  It was a very windy day and of course the helicopter heads toward the lake.  It was only during the ride there, and getting high enough so where the wind wouldn't push the helicopter around made the situation much much better.  But before we got to 1200 feet, my stomach wasn't agreeing with me.  My wife was like "Woooo!!" and having a great time, and of course our pilot John was super calm and relaxed, so that helped me not to worry about anything too much.  Once at 1200 feet, we were treated to exceptional views of the loop, Navy Pier, Grant Park, Washington Park, Douglas Park, The United Center, Soldier Field, several historic buildings, and of course the lake, which was beautiful, and across from which Michigan was visible.  The pilot told us a little about what was below us and what to look for without being too talkative, it was great.  We took a bunch of pictures, and they came out really good because Rotorzen makes sure their windows stay very clean.  The ride is so fun that it seemed to end too soon.  However, the ride does make you hungry, so as we approached Midway I began to crave pizza or something since I hadn't eaten much before the flight (probably why I was a little ugh).  The whole experience was unforgettable, exciting, and definitely a highlight of me and my wife's relationship.  We are sure to return sometime in the future for a night flight as I hear those are breathtaking.
