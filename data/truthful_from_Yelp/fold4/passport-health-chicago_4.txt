This place is great. I needed a last minute vaccination before my trip to Brazil, and I was able to get in the same day I called for an appointment. I arrived early and was accommodated very quickly. The nurse was knowledgeable and friendly, and the price was the cheapest in town. Â I will go here if I ever need more.
