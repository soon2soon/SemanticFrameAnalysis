Can't complain about this hotel...nice suite I stayed in...love how there is no charge for the gym EVEN tho I havnt stepped inside to work out YET lolz I will tonight... Nice jacuzzi... Huge pool and saunas as well!!! Nice staff as well... Close to blue lines.... And a cheap liqour around the area... Just ask the trolley to drop u off anywhere 5 mile radius. Would def recommend this hotel. :)
