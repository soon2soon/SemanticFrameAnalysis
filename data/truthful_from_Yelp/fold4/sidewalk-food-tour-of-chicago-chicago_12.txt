This is simply a great tour.  We have done similar tours all over the world and our tour with this company was first class.  Easy to book.  We called the number and there was a helpful, friendly man that made the whole process easy.  Our guide, Jake, met us promptly at the appointed time.  After introductions and a brief overview of his background and the neighborhood, we were off for our 3 hour walk.  As we wandered through the neighborhood Jake was full of interesting details about the people of the area and places.  Then there was the food!  We started with donuts, then meatballs, fried chicken, beef sandwiches and cookies.  Delicious and so much fun to sample on our journey. The tour is for everyone.  We were a group of good friends from the Chicago burbs but I could easily see this for tourists wanting to see a personal side of Chicago.  Great tour, easy walk, wonderful food all with a knowledgeable guide.  A home run!
