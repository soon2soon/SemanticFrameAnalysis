As much as I love Union Station, Ogilvie might actually be the station I prefer. Actually, yeah, I think I love Ogilvie. It's the perfect train station, in my opinion. The first thing you notice when you step off the Metra in the station? No funny smells! Yep. This station is pretty clean, very easy to navigate, and small, but not crowded. Stuck here for an hour or so, waiting for a train? No problem. There's a spacious food court with multiple fast food options, as well as many shops through the rest of the station (bookstore, gifts, clothing, etc.). This station is also a bit more of a direct walk to State Street shops and other touristy Chicago attractions, which is nice. So... Union is definitely bigger & crazy, but this is the sweeter station.
