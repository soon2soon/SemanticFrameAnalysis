I've metra'd to Glenview from the Loop since April 2004.  Couple of pointers for the driving community: 1) Buy a 10-ride.  You'll use them eventually -- it's cheaper by 20%. 2) Get a schedule from metrarail.com a few days before you're going to go...better to plan, especially when it freezing outside 3) Sit UPSTAIRS.  Yep.  It is the best seat in the train - better view, less congested, a bit more private, and if you plan on working, way more space 4) Be ontime.  The trains NEVER wait for passengers.   5) Bring work -- it's the most productive time you'll ever have (no internet, no desk phone, no colleagues, etc). 6) Bring food -- yep, you can eat on the Metra.   Steve
