First time in Chicago for both my Girl and I so we wanted to see the architecture of the city. Seadogs has a great tour. Our guide Chopper offered a lot of information and Â kept it interesting with some trivia. I'd recommend this tour to anyone who is in town! Also Captain Dave and Greg were very hospitable. Looking forward to returning to this great city and seeing Chicago from the water again.
