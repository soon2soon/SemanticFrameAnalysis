We had a great experience on our river and lake tour. I thought that 90 minutes was going to end up being a bit long but it flew by. A gorgeous Chicago day coupled with a great tour guide made for a super trip! A big shout out to Brandon, our friendly and helpful tour guide, who kept us entertained with history and tidbits from start to finish. I can certainly see giving some of their other tours a try on other visits to Chicago.
