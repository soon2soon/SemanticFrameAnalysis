Found a new favorite place to get my grub on. This place is absolutely amazing, Ngoc, the owner is probably the sweetest and most genuine Vietnamese woman I have ever met. The food itself is phenomenal. Bar as well and they are open until 10pm if you call ahead of time there is a chance that they will prepare your meal despite that they just closed. It's not a guarantee but it couldn't hurt to try if you're in the neighborhood. Speaking of try, the pho and banh mi are exceptional ! Must try.
