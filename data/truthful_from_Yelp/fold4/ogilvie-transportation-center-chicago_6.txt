Have 30 minutes to spare before your train boards, well, you're in good company. Take a walk downstairs to the French Market and enjoy the vast cuisine! There's Saigon Sisters (Vietnamese food), fresh pasta, fresh groceries, various Olive Oils, gelato, fresh hot sandwiches, beer, wine, name it and you shall find it. Upstairs or ground level you will find more restaurants, drug store, coffee shop, and lots of sitting area. The station itself is clean and organize. The tracks are visibily labeled and there's signs everywhere reminder you to check your ticket to make sure you're on the right track number. For the few minutes I got to wander to this station I fell in love. If I ever worked in Chicago or need to take the metra in I hope to always stop at this transportation center with time to spare so I can explore.
