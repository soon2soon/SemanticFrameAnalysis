This place is amazing!!  The staff are helpful, kind, and the woman in the kitchen has got some skills!  Even if the location wasn't convenient, the rooms spotless, great amenities, the price right, it is the food that will keep you coming back.  Holy cow!!  Eggs Benedict on Sundays are a must.  Then there were the maple bacon pancakes.  Yes please.  I love this place and will return in a heart beat.
