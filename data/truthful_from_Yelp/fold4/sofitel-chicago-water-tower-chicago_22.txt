Very clean - very convenient, modern, and perfect for our trip. the rooms and bathrooms are on the small size, not cramped but def similar to what you find in Europe. but everything is like new, super clean, and fresh. can't beat the prices or the location. All the staff is very courteous and helpful. Â If you stay there you got to hit Pizanos pizza right next door - that place is awesome!
