Relayrides is amazing for people who don't have cars! The website is so easy to navigate, so many cars to choose from, and the fine print is very easy to understand. I took a trip from Chicago to Grand Rapids and it went as smoothly as possible. The security deposit felt a little harsh on my bank account for such a short term rental, but it was returned a few days after I returned the car. I am using it again for a vacation next week in Seattle. The owner of the car is actually willing to meet me at the airport for my arrival and departure. SO EASY!
