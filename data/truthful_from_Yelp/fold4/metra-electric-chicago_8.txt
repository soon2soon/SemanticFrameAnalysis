All the other reviews talk about the "ugly train." What is an attractive train? It gets you from A to B for 8 bucks with the ability to drink booz and make fun of the tourists who try to put their 'American Girl Place' bags on the seats only to be scolded by the blunt and semi-abrasive conductors: "you need to put your bags in the overhead, we have a full train tonight." great train, convenient, dependable, and CHEAP. What more do you want?
