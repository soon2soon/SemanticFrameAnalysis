When we need a rental car, we ALWAYS rent from National (Emerald Club).   The service is impeccable, and the car selection is always awesome.  When we rent near home, we always use the 203 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago IL rental location.  It provides wonderful customer service, and an easy in and out since this rental location is a smaller operation than the larger National Rental locations, such at the airport.  The hours of operation are great, too.    We see the same gentleman (cannot remember his name) at the office where the cars are located in the parking garage, and he is awesome!  He makes the rental experience super easy and fun, too, with always a smile.  Highly recommend.
