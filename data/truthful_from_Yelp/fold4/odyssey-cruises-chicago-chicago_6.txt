This is a fun way to spend a nice Chicago afternoon. We went on a 2.5 hour lunch buffet cruise. The food is great and the view from Lake Michigan is awesome. The DJ was pretty fun. A good number of people went up dancing on the stage. Once liquored up, a good number of people also started picking up the microphone to start the karaoke. The best seat of the boat, of course, is at the top deck. You get the views and it was definitely more serene up there.
