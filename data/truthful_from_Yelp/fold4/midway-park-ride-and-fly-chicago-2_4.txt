When you arrive, the shuttle driver follows you to your spot and helps with your bags! Very sweet and awesome! Short 4-5 minute ride to MDW. When you get back, call/text the number the driver gave you on the ticket when you left and they will be there within minutes (chances are other people on your flight used them and called so you don't have to wait long). Prompt drivers, car was kept safe, decent price! Can't beat this.
