I stayed here for about a week for business and it was a very nice hotel.  The two best things about this place is the location and its service.  The employees here, from the bellboys to the front desk, are excellent.  They use the term "my pleasure" and it never gets old.  They seem to genuinely care about helping you and are happy to assist in any way.  The lady who works the breakfast bar is very friendly too - always full of energy. The breakfast bar has a great variety of freshly made hot foods. The room was spacious and comfortable.  TV was flat screen, had HBO, and the view was excellent.  My only knock is...the sink's water pressure was very weak.  Free WiFi and the rooms are close to the elevator, and the elevators are very efficient in speed. Did I mention the location?  Right in the heart of downtown.  15-20 minute cab ride to surrounding areas.  Walking distance to all the fine restaurants and bars and shopping. I obviously didn't pay for the room so it's easier for me to write all of this, but if I were to come back to Chicago for business I would def welcome another stay here.
