I adore Southwest almost as much as I adore JetBlue...but JetBlue doesn't go to Chicago so Southwest is my midwest favorite.  There is enough leg and elbow room, you can get there early to determine your seating fate no matter when you bought your tickets, and the crew has a great sense of humor.  I don't necessarily need fancy meals or stupid in flight movies...I just want to be comfortable, and Southwest does a good job at that.
