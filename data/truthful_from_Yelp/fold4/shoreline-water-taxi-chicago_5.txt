This is not your usual boat rde.  From beginning to end, this was a stand out experience.  The ticket sellers were friendly and courteous.  The staff on board the ship were AWESOME!  So, knowledgeable and humorous and professional.  One might balk at the cost, but honestly, it's a great way to see and hear about the architectural marvel that is Chicago.
