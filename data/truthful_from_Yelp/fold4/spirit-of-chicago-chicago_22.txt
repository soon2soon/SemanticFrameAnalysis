Today, after being in Chicago for over a year, I ventured down to Navy pier for the first time - because, today I was going on my first cruise -- EVER! I nearly didn't go -- rainy weather and all.  The ride to the pier I noticed a very choppy lake and wondered if the cruise would be canceled It was an event for work, people from 3 offices there - I think I knew all of 6 people in attendance.  Still, it was a great time.   Food was good, the view was amazing -- both of the city skyline as well as the breakers crashing  against and over  the wall in the lake.  Awesome! Dancing proved a challenge at times -- but no one lost their balance and we were doing some step specific dancing.   The DJ was a hoot and a half -- a true cut up.  Our Cruise director was a pistol.  On many occasions, the staff joined us on the dance floor for brief periods. A fun time was had by all -- laughter and smiles all around! I have to say my first cruise experience was a good one and I'd do it again -- most definitely!
