I sort of don't want you to go to this place because I have designs on it.  I want to move in.  I want it all to myself.   We managed to book a last minute room there last weekend - Ray had a cancellation.  We'd heard of it through a friend and had not looked it up, so arrived free of expectations.  The place is funky, but beautiful in a hip, modern, eclectic way.  He has mid-century furniture and pottery that is to die for, but it's not a museum, it's a loved living space.  When you walk in, Ray has a giant map wall.  I love that map wall.  I love the small tile backsplash.  I love the color.  I love the fact that there is a shrine to an old neighborhood restaurant hanging above the reception area.  I love the bird art.  I love the tv playing the election coverage.  I love the breakfast.  The apple pie baking.  The cozy everything.  The robes.  The nice tubs.  I love the sauna.  I love the communal attitude, the washer dryer, the granola bars and water bottles.  Umbrellas.  Band aids.  Candy.  Ray has thought of everything.  Everything.  And he is generous.   Our room was tiny - so you best go there with someone you really like.   I seriously would go back for a month if I could afford it. You should go there.  I will be back.
