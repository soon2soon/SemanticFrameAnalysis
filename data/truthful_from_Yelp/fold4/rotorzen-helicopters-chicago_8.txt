WHAT FUN! This was my time in a helicopter and it was a great experience. John conducted our safety instructions pre flight and Ryan was our pilot. Ryan was a great pilot and our flight was smooth. I was a little nervous as I can get air sick and I didn't want the ride to turn into the "vomit comet." We flew around the city and saw the lakefront, downtown, us cellular field, wrigleyville, etc. I am a Chicago native and this was a fun, new way to see the city. Highly recommended.
