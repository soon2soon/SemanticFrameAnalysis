Location - great, seems that is not up for debate. Rooms - I got to see two different rooms while I was there. One on the 5th floor, King bed, no view but really spacious, clean, modern and a ridiculously great shower, with a very large bathroom to match. This room made staying 5 nights with my messy fiance actually pleasant, in fact it's an upgrade from our smaller, not-as-well-laid-out apartment in nyc. I also got to see a room with a view - this was also a King, but the layout was really odd. It had an entryway with stairs lowering down into the bed area, but that cut off a lot of potentially open and usable space. The bathroom was updated and very clean, but small and didn't have the awesome rain shower of the other. This room was an 'upgrade' from the other, due to the great view, but a definite downgrade from the non-view room. Now, onto the service. This is always so subjective - depends who you get, what mood they're in, and of course, how nice or obnoxious you are. I do think this team deserves a service shout-out though. When we arrived, they told us that the blackout curtains in the hotel were being replaced, and they hadn't gotten to our room yet. For this, they gave us complementary drinks at the bar upstairs and a few dollars to spend at the breakfast downstairs. They offered to upgrade us to a queen room with a view for free, but we chose the King no-view. The next day, they offered us a king room with a view, and so we switched. They moved all our stuff for us and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. But once in the king-view room upgrade, I realized i preferred the no-view room (see Room comments above). So we asked if we could move back down again. I knew this was ridiculous, and they couldn't have been nicer about it. They even gave us more money to spend at the cafe downstairs! Now, that's what I call service.
