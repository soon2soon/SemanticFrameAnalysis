Great neighborhood hotel. Staff were friendly. Â Wifi was free and in-room minibar prices quite reasonable ($2.50 for a Heineken, $2.00 for a Bud). These are pet peeved of mine so I liked it. Parking was $20 per day so keep that in mind, but this old fashioned European-style hotel hit exactly the right spot for me and my wife.
