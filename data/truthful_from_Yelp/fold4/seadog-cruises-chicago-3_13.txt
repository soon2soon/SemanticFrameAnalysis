My favorite part of my trip to Chicago! Seadog Cruises offers a couple different options. I really love architecture, so of course I chose that tour! The guy at the ticket booth wasn't very helpful. He told us to come back 5 min before our departure time to wait in line.....when the line was already super long!! Plus he didn't know where I could find a good chocolate covered banana nearby. There is a reason why he is not giving any Chicago tours. Â  But I digress, the real tour guide was awesomely funny and entertaining. He was very interactive and had some interesting tidbits of info for each major building. I also went during sunset, which made the photo ops beautiful. The only down side of going on the last tour out was when they went all fast at the end in Lake Michigan and everyone got wet. Water was splashing up and with the sun setting, it got cold quick. But at least we weren't on the last Extreme Thrill Ride. Everyone on that boat was soaked to the bone wet and it didn't look very fun being wet at night. Maybe save that one for a hot sunny day. I definitely recommend the architecture tour for anyone who hasn't gone yet!
