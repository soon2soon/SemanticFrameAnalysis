My experience was spectacular from beginning to end. It's such a great service and an innovative idea. I've told so many people about this service both before and after my trip and have yet to find one person even aware that this is possible -- but hopefully it catches on! You completely avoid all the outrageous fees that rental companies throw at you and you get the personal touch of interacting with the car owner, who is often very flexible and kind. The site was easy to navigate and very clear -- you see exactly what car you can get, who owns it and where it's located. You can look for exactly the sort of car you want, in your price range, AND you can factor insurance right into the cost. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to someone who just needs a car for errands or something like that -- for short, quick trips, something like Zipcar is probably still your best bet. But this charges by the day so for longer trips it's absolutely perfect. I consider this service a complete win-win both for the owners and the renters. Happy to give RelayRides 5 stars.
