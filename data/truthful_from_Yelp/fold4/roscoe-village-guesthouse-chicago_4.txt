Roscoe village property and staff was exceptional from the payment process, to check in, to helping us get our bearings around the city and being on top of everything else very flexible on our reservation. We throughly enjoyed the property. For 3 couples the place was great and easy to get to from neighborhood places. The bathrooms were gorgeous - something owners would strive for in their own home renovations. The house definitely helped to make my sisters 30th birthday a blast and we would all stay again.
