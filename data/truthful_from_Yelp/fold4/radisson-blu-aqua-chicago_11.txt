I have been waiting to rave about this hotel for a few weeks now. My boyfriend and I had been searching for a nice hotel room to get for one night for our anniversary (even though we're Chicago natives so the city isn't anything new to us). After countless days searching for the perfect room, we kept coming back to the Raddison Blu Aqua. We decided to finally make the reservation. They have the most friendly front desk employees. The young lady helping us was so helpful and truly seemed like she cared about each of us having an enjoyable stay. The room itself reminded me of a small studio apartment. Everything was sleek, clean and modern (to me anyway) with wooden floors and big windows. I can definitely write a novel about how absolutely breathtaking the views were from the Park View room we had but I'll save it, just go there and see for yourself folks. I enjoyed the room so much I didn't want to leave the room for anything! Sadly, we didn't make it to the outdoor pool during our stay, but it looked nice. They have a large modern lounge area outside and a nice bar Â inside by the lobby too. Overall, this will be my 1st and only choice for somewhere to stay in the city!
