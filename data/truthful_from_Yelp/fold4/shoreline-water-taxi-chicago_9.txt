************* REVIEW 148 **************** Who would have thought Water Taxi can be so much fun? After 8 years I had been coming to Chi Town, this is 1 of the most simple fun that I ever had & didn't cost much. I got to see some of the most beautiful sights of Chicago for this cheap, seriously. Lake Service between Navy Pier to Shedd Aquarium, Buckingham Fountain. $7 for adult & $4 for kids. River service between Navy Pier & Wells/Wacker, also connecting to Michigan Avenue. $5 for adult & $3 for kids.
