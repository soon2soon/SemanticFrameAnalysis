Took scuba classes with Rami at Scuba Sensations, and can't really think of any way that the experience could have been any better. The store isn't some giant superstore, but they have a pretty good selection, reasonable prices, and a valuable asset in Rami, who is engaged, engaging, and very helpful. Â A cool resource on Chicago's North Side.
