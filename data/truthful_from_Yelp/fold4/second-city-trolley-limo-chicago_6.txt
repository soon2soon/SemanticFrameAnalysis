I have used Second City Trolley about four times in the past year and this past experience was by far the best!! Obviously we had a wonderful time and the driver Ali was the MAN but the experience with Second City was even better because of how professional they were with the a particular situation of mine. Originally when I booked the trolley I guess I checked a box stating that I was going to put the full charge of the trolley on my card (the same one I put the deposit on). The day of the trolley I collected the money and gave it to the driver with tip included. A couple of days later I saw that there was a charge on my card of $500+ and immediately went into panic mode.  After calling and speaking to Second City, they told me that they had noticed the problem and had refunded my money. They even offered to send me a check if I had preferred DESPITE the fact that it was my mistake! The first trolley we took, my boyfriend left his iPod on the trolley and it was returned no problem as well. Moral of the story is that this company is honest and know how to provide a great time!  We will definitely be using their services again and are very much looking forward to many more successful rides :)
