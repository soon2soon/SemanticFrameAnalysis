Rami and his crew at Scuba Sensations are simply amazing!  My husband and I just finished our Open Water Diver certifications.  Rami and his staff are focused on providing high-quality, thorough, and FUN instruction/training in all aspects of scuba to produce safe and competent divers.  The dive shop also has a great selection of gear, and Rami will spend whatever time you need to answer all of your questions on the pros and cons of different types of gear.  We will definitely be taking more training courses and buying more gear from here!
