Being a native Chicagoan, I love to come downtown and stay like a tourist in my own town. This hotel isn't just one of the better hotels in Chicago, this is one of the better hotels in the world. Exceptional service- literally there are staff everywhere to attend to your needs. Le Bar is great- the bartenders and serving staff are professional and efficient in addition to being friendly. Rooms are elegantly decorated, and the bed is as good as (if not better than) the Westin Heavenly Bed. Room service was wicked fast and delicious (the french press coffee was amazing). Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel for a splurge when you're with someone special. Outstanding experience overall, I can't find a single thing to complain about.
