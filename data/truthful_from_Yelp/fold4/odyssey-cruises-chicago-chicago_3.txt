Beautiful experience overall. Really enjoyed the view and the service for the lunch cruise. The food was great--had lobster bisque and the salmon. Also had a delicious chocolate mousse dessert. The freshly baked rolls were delicious as well. Honestly, I have been on other cruises and this was by far one of the best! The bathrooms were nice too lol. And it was big and modern. They had good music and a DJ. Definitely worth the price! A nice cruise to go on with family, friends, or partner!
