This is my 2nd long stay at this hotel for work (each time was 11 nights). They do an awesome job at making you feel at home. The rooms are big with the living room separated. New flat screen in living room but super old school tube tv in bedroom. It would be nice to have it the other way around. Turn down service is great! Best part is the rewards program. Free beverages in the am (coffee, tea, juice, even red bull!), free wifi, free bottled water and free clothing pressings. This location is central to everything!! Everything is on Michigan Ave. The only thing that bothered me is they wouldn't allow me to request a king bed because my company had booked me 2 double beds. Normally when that happens, I just call the hotel beforehand or ask at check in. This time, they wouldn't switch anything and told me to call my company to change it. It just seems so small and I would never call my company to bother them wih that.
