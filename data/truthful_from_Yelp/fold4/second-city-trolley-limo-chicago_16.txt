I booked a 35 passenger Trolley with Second City for a friends going away party. I've dealt with many Trolley companies around Chicago and they are by far the best. From booking to the event, it was perfect. Our driver took us wherever we wanted and were extremely flexible with our rowdy group. BOOK with Second City if you want the easiest and most flexible company. We had a blast!
