So..I'm Loving Metra.. Especially the Union Pacific North Line which takes me out to Ravinia for some great concerts.. And.. the ride home is always the best,, Tonight lots of people were really trashed after the Glen Campbell/ Ronnie Milsap Concert and it was the party train to beat all... People popping Beer Cans and singing Glen Campbell Songs all the way home back to the city.. A nice Conductor.. except he called me Maa'm and that makes me realize how old I really am.. So.. this I did'nt like! A nice Comfy Seat, some drunk people, Glen Campbell's Galveston and Rhinestone Cowboy being sung to me.. What more could a girl want? I love Metra.. Especially the party trains.. Everybody get on board.. Nuff Said..:)
