Cannot say enough great things about this hotel...somehow lucked out and got this hotel on priceline for around $105 a night.  Great location, large room, magnificent bed, and lovely customer service.  They let me check in early at 10am and offered free coffee in the lobby.  Also, conveniently located very close to the Chik-Filet (classy, I know).
