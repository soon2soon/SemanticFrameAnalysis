I never would have done this if not for Groupon, but I'm so glad I did! I took my sister and 4 year-old niece up yesterday and it was fantastic. Our little passenger squealed with delight as soon as she saw the helicopter waiting for us, and she didn't stop smiling until long after dinner. Our pilot Ryan was cool and professional and made sure we had a smooth ride -- with, of course, a few big turns, which our little one loved. Ryan pointed out landmarks and gave us some photo tips but never came close to being too chatty. Now I want to do it again with my nephew and other niece. The views are fantastic, so grab your camera and book your flight. Don't even think twice, especially if you can get your hands on a Groupon special -- you will not regret it.
