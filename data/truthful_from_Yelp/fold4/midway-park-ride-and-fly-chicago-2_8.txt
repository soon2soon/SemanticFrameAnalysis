I shopped around for a while trying to decide where to park my vehicle when I was flying out of Midway - and I am EXTREMELY happy I picked this company. There was no waiting at both departure and arrival and the employees were very nice. They pick you up directly from your car and drop you back off there. No walking & no waiting! My flight was even delayed by 40 minutes and still no hassles or extra fees. I parked outside and used a coupon and thought the price was very reasonable. Will use again! Thank you!
