We parked here for the first time last week. Prepaid online (discount). Drove right in and was followed by the shuttle truck. Driver got out and took my bags and drove right to the airport. 5-10 minutes tops. Pick up was even better. I called as soon as I arrived and before picking up my bags. Shuttle was right out the door. Got on and arrived at my car 10 minutes later. The driver got out of the shuttle, helped me with my bags and brushed the snow off my car. I would highly recommend this service to anyone flying out of Midway.
