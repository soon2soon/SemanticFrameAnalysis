What a great find. We booked this hotel without much research, and we surely lucked out. First off, the location couldn't be better. Immediately walkable to navy pier, the magic mile, water tower place, and not far from millennium park. You can feel the heartbeat of the city here. The decor is modern with eclectic touches. The lady at the front desk checked us in with a cheerful smile and friendly offering of a map, after heading upstairs to the 10th floor, we were pleasantly surprised by our room. We were expecting a standard, two queen bed room. We got that certainly, but also a spacious desk area, a keurig-style coffee maker, and a lovely bathroom. After a warm shower (with pleasantly high water pressure) we headed for checkout. The bellhop checked our bags for free so we could explore the city for the day, and the same woman at the front desk (who remembered my name) helpfully recommended a boat architecture tour, booked it for us, and got us a 10% discount. I highly recommend this hotel and would gladly stay again!
