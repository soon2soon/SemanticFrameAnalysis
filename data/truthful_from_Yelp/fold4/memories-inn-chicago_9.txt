Decided to stop on by on a whim with my date since it was very close to her place on  a Sunday night. According to Google, this was Vietnamese restaurant. When we stopped on in, we were initially confused. We thought we walked into the wrong place. The front part of the building is a bar with quite a few European customers hanging around. There was a little DJ booth spewing some eastern European music (probably Romanian). The back half was the actually Vietnamese restaurant. It was empty so we were promptly seated and they also  turned down the music (thank god). The place is nice and clean.   Upon reading the menu, we confirmed that this was actually the right place (hehe). We both ordered the beef flank pho. The food came out within 10 minutes. The presentation of the food was excellent. The pho tasted great! I had my fair share of pho around Argyle  and this was one of the best. The flavor of the broth was savory and the beef was tender. The owner, Ngoc, was awesome and attentive to our needs.  She was extremely nice and sweet. She explained that she wanted to keep the bar so she can keep it diverse and grow her business. Anyways, the only improvement I would suggest is maybe moving the bar in the back. to prevent the confusion. We almost walked out thinking the listing was wrong. Speaking to the owner, she states that almost all her new customers has that same sentiment. That is really the only flaw. I really hope she can do something to make the Vietnamese restaurant a more prominent part of the business. It can only help not hurt. With that said, I would highly recommend this place. It is affordable and delicious! I'm planning on making a visit pretty soon!
