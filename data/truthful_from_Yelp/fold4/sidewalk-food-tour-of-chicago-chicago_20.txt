I went on both the Wicker Park and River North tours, and as a local Chicagoan, both tours introduced me to new foods/history/culture of Chicago, and also reminded me of why I love this city. Highly recommended for both locals and tourists! Better yet, locals bring your tourist friends and have a great afternoon experiencing Chicago in a tasty and fun way!
