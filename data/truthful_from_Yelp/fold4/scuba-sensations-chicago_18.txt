If you're looking for a place to get certified (or take other classes I'm sure, I just got certified), there is nothing better around! Rami and his crew are awesome, patient and well versed in all things scuba. Â I bought a ton of gear here and will go back next time I need something. I only have great things to say and recommend them wholeheartedly ;) P.S. Rami loves waffles and if you bring him some, he'll let you sleep in a bit :-)
