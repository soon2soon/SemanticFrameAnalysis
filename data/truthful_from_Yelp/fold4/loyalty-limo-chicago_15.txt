I needed a limo for a bachelorette party and was torn between Loyalty and another company. It was Vince's prompt response, professionalism, and flexibility that won me over. I was given an outstanding price on a beautiful, fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator. Vince took the extra time to calculate the deposit so we were left with an even balance for the night of our event...it was so much easier to collect the cash this way! It's all in the details, and Loyalty Limo doesn't skimp. We originally planned three stops on our way home, but at the last minute decided to cancel one of the drop-off locations. I reached out to Vince and he happily agreed to use the extra time to take us on a moonlit cruise through the city before heading home. We drove by Navy Pier, Soldier Field, Millennium Park, Buckingham Fountain...it was incredible. The day before the event I received an secondary email confirmation with all the details and a friendly confirmation phone call the day of. It was so nice to know I didn't need to worry about following up with these guys...one less thing for me to worry about! Our driver, David, showed up right on time....looking absolutely gorgeous, much to the delight of our post-party bachelorette crew! ;) He was so nice, offered to take a picture of us in front of the limo, and really knew his way around the city. It's construction season and Jazz Fest weekend, but he expertly navigated the streets so we could Â enjoy the beauty of the city on our way out. I am so glad I decided to go with Loyalty. They've made a loyal customer out of me and ten other Chicago-loving women! Absolutely the best limousine experience in Chicago.
