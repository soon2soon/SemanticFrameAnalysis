Better than Spirit of Chicago DEFINITELY. Came here for my 18 & 19th Birthdays..and oh...PROM in 1999 (how could I forget) Service is top-notch. HIGHLY organized, Very professional. They greet you by name.  I purchased some special packages for my birthday dinner  and they did not mess up one bit.  Our personal photo that they take before you board turned out nice! They have great photographers. It is very clean. Views are beautiful.  I spent more time out on the deck than inside.  Jazzy music isn't my type, but the band was still good.  I had to get out and enjoy the view! The seafood ravioli is del-ish!  and their signature chocolate decadent cake to pretty good, too. I love to eat- too bad they don't give you seconds. The portions are smaller than I'm used to. Call me fat. They brought us as far as Evanston and south of Navy Pier.   It was a good time.   Make sure you bring the right person with you if you're in a party for 2.  Remember you're stuck on a boat and over water with that one person.  I'm only saying this, because from my experience...who you bring either makes or breaks the night :) I reccommend this cruise over any other boat in the pier.
