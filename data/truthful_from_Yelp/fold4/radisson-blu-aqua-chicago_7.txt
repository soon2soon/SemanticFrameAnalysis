The best hotel I have stayed at in a very long time! We are here celebrating my friends birthday and the hospitality has been amazing! We were upgraded to a private park view balcony, the room was perfect. They also sent up a nice dessert/snack dish that said "Happy Birthday" in chocolate cursive! My friend is having the time of her life, and it's only been one night. I have no complaints whatsoever. We will definitely be back!
