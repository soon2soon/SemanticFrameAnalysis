If you're looking to do any level of PADI certification I would highly recommend Scuba Sensations.  I went into the Open Water training not knowing what to expect.  What I discovered was an awesome learning environment fostered by Rami, an extremely passionate and knowledgeable instructor and diver.  Not only did he make the learning process fun but he encouraged me to take full advantage of the certification and dive as much as possible! If you're looking for diving gear Rami has a plethora of equipment to choose from for most any budget.  He has a large selection of high end as well as an affordable selection of equipment and gear.  We went with Atomic Aquatics for our fins, mask and snorkel.  I will definitely hit up Scuba Sensations when I'm ready to purchase more gear. All in all I had an awesome experience!
