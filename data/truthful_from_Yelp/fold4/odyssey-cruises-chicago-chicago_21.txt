Sometimes, people think the view makes the food taste better... But with Odyssey...the food DOES taste better! I know it's a bit pricey, but Odyssey is well worth it.  We were on this ship for a friend's birthday and it was a GREAT time.  Top it off with July 4th fireworks, and Champagne for the occasion (included in the price)...we had a smashing time.  Ooooh...and on top of that...the dessert table...can anyone say chocolate fountain??  :)
