This is a great way to explore Wicker Park! As a vegetarian, I didn't think I would really enjoy a food tour in the city that stopped at so many meat-themed places, but Sidewalk Food Tours of Chicago made great accommodations for me! This tour was a great mix of history, culture and food...even if you know the wicker park area, you'll definitely still be able to learn something new! It was a very cool mix of major streets and more residential areas, and Ashley (our awesome tour guide) had plenty of visual aids to show off as we went. By far, Antique Taco was my favorite stop and I'll totally go back there. Ashley said it was her goal for us to leave the tour feeling full and like we learned something. Mission accomplished!
