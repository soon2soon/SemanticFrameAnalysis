I've been on both the River North and Wicker Park food tours. Â Both were excellent. Today we were in Wicker Park with our guide Ashley. She was wonderful - knowledgeable, energetic, and fun. We started with a huge 1/2 donut from Glazed & Infused...yum. We were on our way to 3 hours of interesting facts about Wicker Park, down some of the side streets to see the architecture, and inside some restaurants that I would never have known about. Chop Shop was really cool and had great meatballs. Antique Taco has the best tacos, and the coconut margarita wasn't too bad either. I can't say enough good stuff about these tours. They are a great way to learn about a part of the city, explore some new restaurants and enjoy some delicious food. Well done!
