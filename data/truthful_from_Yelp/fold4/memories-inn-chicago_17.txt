Yummy food and super friendly staff. Pho is pretty awesome here! Totally confused when walked in about the bar up front and restaurant in back like other reviews but doesn't bother me that much. Came here at Thursday night at like 10pm , def like how it's a late night spot. Also extra bonus points for playing late 90's/00's jams like destiny's child and Leona Lewis bleeding love. Def would come back
