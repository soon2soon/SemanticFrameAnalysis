I love you, Renaissance Blackstone. I hope that we can be in an exclusive relationship going forward. Renaissance met all the marks for me. In addition to it's luxury and beauty, it was pretty convenient for me. It's located close to the Harrison red line stop and the Metra station. We checked in around 8 PM on a Saturday night and had to be out right away the next morning, so we didn't get to do much exploring but the accommodations exceeded my expectations. We'd hoped we could get in at the restaurant, but they didn't have any openings, so the front desk clerk made recommendations for other quick restaurants in the area. She was so nice and actually felt bad that she couldn't get us reservations. I love great customer service! The best part about our room was that the king bed was extra comfortable. So much so that I didn't want to get out of it to head home. Another pro is that the room was spacious. Thanks for a great night's sleep, Renaissance!
