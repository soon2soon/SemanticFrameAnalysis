My first time using RelayRides - I rented a truck to pick up a couch and some stuff from Ikea. Everything went really smoothly. The owner was friendly, the pickup and dropoff were smooth, etc. I wished there were a few more options for trucks closer to me, but hopefully that will change in the future.
