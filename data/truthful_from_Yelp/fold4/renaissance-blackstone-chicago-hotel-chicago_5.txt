I fell in love with the Blackstone. It's location across from Grant Park is perfect, it's not a far walk from Millennium Park, Museum Park,  great breakfast spots such as Yolk and The Bongo Room are a few blocks out. You can catch the Chicago Double Decker trolley right next door at the Hilton. The rooms are great size, the beds are super comfortable.  And the decor is on point. I love the old meats modern feel, and the hotel staff was the friendliest Midwestern people that made me fall in love with Chicago. Will try and stay here again for sure
