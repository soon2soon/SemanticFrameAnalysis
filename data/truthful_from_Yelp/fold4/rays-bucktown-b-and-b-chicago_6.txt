It's always a pleasure to stay with Ray & friends when visiting Chicago. Located in a centrally located residential neighborhood - there's always something to do within walking distance or a short cab ride. Vegan French toast is a must for breakfast even if you're not a vegan! When my kid graduates and I no longer have to visit Chicago, I may have to find a reason to visit just to return to this fabulous little retreat.
