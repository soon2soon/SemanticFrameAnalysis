Great place to park at Midway!   I have been meaning to write  a review for a while.  They are well run and always have discount codes available online.  You also get frequent parking points to use for free parking.  Drivers are helpful and courteous.  They will pick you up and drop you off right at your car and help you with your luggage. Make sure to book well ahead of time on peak travel days like Thanksgiving!  I made this mistake and they were full so I had to book at a horrible lot down the street.
