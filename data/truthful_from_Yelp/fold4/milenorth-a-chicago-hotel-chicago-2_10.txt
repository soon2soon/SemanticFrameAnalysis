LOVED this hotel.  I was in town last week for 3 nights and I enjoyed every minute of my stay at Mile North.  The location is extremely convenient.  I was able to do the Michigan Avenue thing, get to the lake shore quickly, and meet my friend in the heart of The Loop in the middle of a work day, all with no problem. I had a Queen Suite that face the Hancock building.  This is probably the biggest hotel room I have ever stayed in; I'm pretty sure it's bigger than some apartments I've lived in.  Loved having the mini fridge in the room, but I really wish there was a corresponding microwave.   Only negative I experienced is the little Starbucks cafe in the lobby.  I bought a bottle of water and a regular sized Naked juice and it cost $10.  I know I'm in downtown Chicago and, on some level, I'm paying for the convenience - but come on.  It's only your hotel guests who are getting anything from the cafe, and you already got their money from the room.  Take it down a level.
