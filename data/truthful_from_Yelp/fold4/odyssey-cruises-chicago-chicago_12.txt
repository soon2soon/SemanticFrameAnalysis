We went on the Father's Day dinner cruise. Wonderful experience! Excellent views, great service, delicious food. Book a window seat and upgrade to premium bar package to really make the most of this, it'll be we'll worth the extra $$ especially if you're bringing a bunch of Brits like I was! The only criticism I have is that it was over too quickly!!
