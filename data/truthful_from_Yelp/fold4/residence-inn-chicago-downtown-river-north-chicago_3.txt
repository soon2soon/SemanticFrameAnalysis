The best thing about this area having SO many hotels is that all the hotels seem to step it up in order to win your business. I stayed here for about 6 nights for a conference and I'd highly recommend Residence Inn. Pros: -GREAT location--tons and tons of restaurants/bars within walking distance so not having a car is really not a big deal at all. It's also easy accessible by subway if you're coming from Midway -Free breakfast. This really helps if you're here for a conference and don't have time to run out and find something -24 hour gym. I don't even go to the gym and I ended up using this a lot (they have the machines that have TVs with them so I easily had a long workout just by watching a TV show). They also have a pool here -Cozy and QUIET rooms. You have your own kitchen but I was really happy with how surprisingly quiet it was (although if the person next door slams their door while leaving, you can hear it very well). I slept really well here. -Free beer & wine on Mon/Tues/Wed in the evening. Because who doesn't love free beer? -Helpful and friendly staff. Anything we needed, they would be very prompt in taking care of it -They also apparently have free grocery delivery service (delivery is free, you just pay for the groceries?) I didn't use this but that sounds like a damn good option. Anyway, I'm a big fan of this place. Good job Residence Inn.
