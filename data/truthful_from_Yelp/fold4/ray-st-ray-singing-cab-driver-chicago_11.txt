So its St. patty's day, and I've already had one of the more memorable nights ever in my life. I'm a little drunk and in Logan Square, god knows why I'm in Logan Square at this point in the night, but whatever. So in an effort to get home sooner rather than morning I hail a cab, and that my friends is when shit gets real. So I'm politely talking to the cab driver about my night and my band that I just hung out with, when he proceeds to go into his speel about being the singing cabdriver. Ha ha, funny.. It wasnt until he verbally went into the song selection menu where I figured I was either being filmed for HBO or probably on my way to being murdered in some alley....with my money being on the later, which is why i calmy yet carefully started to write his cab number and name on one of my cards and put it in my sock (so the police could find it when they examined the body). So I carefully select a song about taxi driving, can't get any motivation for killing and raping anyone from cabdriving, right? In the end the song was cool, he was cool, and even went into banter about buildings and old Chicago. He politely and quickly got me to where I needed and I was not murdered, just Â given a card in rememberance of a cab ride strictly out of the twilight zone. This dude is one of the reasons why Chicago is the greatest city in the frickin' world.
