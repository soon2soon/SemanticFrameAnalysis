I stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions for a business trip. Although I was doing business outside of the Downtown area, this hotel was prime location for me with traveling alone and wanting to be close to various dining options. It was in very close proximity to eateries for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is a Starbucks located less than 2 blocks from the hotel. As far as the hotel stay, it was excellent on both occasions. On my second stay at the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/River North, the hotel had a wine tasting & Italian good night for the current guests. I thought that was absolutely remarkable given the price point of this hotel that was not something I expected. Although the hotel is located Downtown, I stayed on higher floors and was not at all disturbed by the bustling of the traffic in Downtown Chicago. I loved that the rooms had a refrigerator to store leftovers, as well as options to warm up the food. When you are on a trip for more than 2 days, you tend to take full advantage of the amenities included in the room.  As far as parking, I highly recommend paying the extra buck to do valet. That is your best bet! They were very prompt in bringing my car around as long as they had adequate notification time.  Definitely recommend this hotel for either business or pleasure! For the shopping lovers, the Shops at North Bridge is close walking distant to the hotel!
