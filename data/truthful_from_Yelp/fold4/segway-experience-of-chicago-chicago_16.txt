My family and I decided to use our groupon this morning and we are still talking about how much fun we had 6 hours later. Our guide, Eric, was amazing. Before the tour starts, Eric taught us all how to ride the segways one-on-one. He made sure we were all 100% comfortable before the tour started, which was great. Once the tour actually started it was awesome! We went to Buckingham, museum campus, soldier field, millenium park, and grant park. Eric taught us many historical and interesting facts about the city without making it seem like we were in history class. This company is very professional but still fun at the same time. If you want a tour of Chicago but aren't into the old, boring bus and boat rides, this is for sure the way to go. I will definitely be using this company again!
