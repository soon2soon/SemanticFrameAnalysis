A couple friends rented a barhopping trolley on 9/29/12 for their birthdays.  I was just a guest, but I had a great time.  I'll echo other remarks that the trolley was among the better maintained that I've been on: clean, reasonably quiet, comfortable ride, good sound system. Our driver was a younger guy and dressed casually (which is good when you're partying with a bunch of 20-somethings; you don't necessarily want a 50 year-old in a tux).  He was very professional and put up with our lack of planning like a champ.  (If you're planning a barhopping trip, I suggest you research your route in advance.  Some bars are not too keen on you showing up with 30 people that are already quite tipsy.  We take up a lot of space and do most of our drinking en route.) I also have to show special appreciation for these guys helping me find my lost phone.  I had left it on the trolley on Saturday night and called the company at 3am.  Surprisingly, someone picked up at that time and found my phone on the trolley.  A really nice effort that late in the night (and also a nice display of human decency to not claim ignorance and sell it on Craigslist). If I book a trolley of my own for another event, Second City will be at the top of my list.
