I stayed here over New Year's last week and was quite pleased with this hotel. I would stay here again. The rooms are small but good enough for two people. Very clean, I even felt comfortable walking on the carpet barefoot which is something I rarely do in a hotel. The bed and pillows were very comfortable as well. A couple negatives 1) the dryness in the room. If u stay here more than 2 nights I would seriously recommend bringing your own humidifier. I thought I was going to get a nose bleed. 2) the walls are a bit thin so u can hear your neighbor. Maybe we just got stuck next to some Ahole's though. They had a kid that woke us up at the crack of dawn screaming and playing around. I fixed that real quick, I started yelling profanities about having to take a MF shit through the wall. They got the drift and that shut them up.The service here is great,I called the front desk to get more paper coffee cups with lids to use as shopping "roadies". 5 min later a women was at the door delivering. Great shopping and eating location. Here's a parking tip: park directly across the street in the public garage for $42 a night rather than the 65$ a night at the hotel. It's much faster to get your car out to.
