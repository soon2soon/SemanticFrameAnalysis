One stormy and windy night, leaving Carmela's Taqueria after a long long evening of drinking and debauchery. Two girlfriends and I crawled into the backseat of a warm and welcoming cab...once we were on our way, our well dressed driver introduced himself as, Ray St.Ray the Singing Cab Driver! Yeah, we were worried for about a split-second...Ray St.Ray gave us a selection of themes for the night and we happily chose a "A Cautionary Tale of Premarital Sex" as the song for our ride home. Ray rocked it! The whole drive was strangely surreal yet totally fabulous due in part to Ray's singing and in part to the copious amounts of vodka I had consumed. It was a perfectly surprising and random ending to the night and I hope someday soon, I will wander into the back of Ray's cab in a drunken haze, again.
