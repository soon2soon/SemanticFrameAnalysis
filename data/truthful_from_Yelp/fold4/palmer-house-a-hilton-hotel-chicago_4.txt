What a classic and elaborate Victorian architectural interior hotel! I was not expecting an exquisite entrance to this refined place and the welcome area is marvelous!   The cleaning staff was nice and went out of the way to show us the special rooms of this grand palace hotel. We got upgraded to executive suite level for our visit and stay in Chicago and it was surely pleasant!  It was super spacious for just 2 people because it had a conference room with a bar, living room and lounge area. There is Continental Breakfast and I like the tea selections with the cup containers to go.  It was great to hold the container with hot tea in the windy city of Chicago!
