One rule I have when I go to Chicago is this: I will never drive there. For less than seven dollars, I can hop on this train in Michigan City,Indiana and be in the city in less than an hour and a half. The trains arn't luxurious, or catered to be a customer service dream, but they are dependable and cheap. And with the train ride being so short, the comfort level isn't even a big issue. If you live in southern Michigan; forget the Amtrak and just drive to the nearest station in Indiana and save some cash! Thank you South Shore Line!
