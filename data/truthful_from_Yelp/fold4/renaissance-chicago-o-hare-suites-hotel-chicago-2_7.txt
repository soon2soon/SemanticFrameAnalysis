Oh my goodness! What a great hotel! I just stayed here for a wedding this past weekend and it was amazing. Great staff, awesome rooms, clean, friendly, and affordable I might add (I'm a broke college student). The hall that the reception was held in was beautiful, bartenders were attentive and fast---I just really enjoyed my stay here and I hope to come back. PS-the Starbucks located inside of the hotel was the cherry on top.
