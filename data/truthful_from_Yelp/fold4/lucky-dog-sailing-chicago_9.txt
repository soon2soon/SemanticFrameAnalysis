I took my Dad sailing on Father's Day and he had an absolute blast.  It certainly helped that the weather was perfect but Captain Tom and his wife Kristi made sure the trip was a memorable one.   Their brand new boat was a pleasure to be aboard.  There was plenty of room to move around, take pictures, and enjoy the day.  If any of you out there read this review, I will assure that I'm not the type to even right reviews but this experience was too good to keep to myself.  Tom &amp; Kristi, thanks for the great time and we hope to see you again soon!
