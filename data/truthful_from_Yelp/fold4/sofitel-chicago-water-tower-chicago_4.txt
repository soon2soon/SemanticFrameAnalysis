Stayed here for my husband's nephew college graduation. The hotel itself is beautiful (very modern chic) , and I love their eclectic flower arrangements (per the photo). The staff, very friendly and courteous - room service and front desk was prompt. However their restaurant service is very slow for breakfast, so only come downstairs if you can allow yourself a leisurely dining experience before starting your day. The room was modern and spacious, and they have Lanvin toiletries. The only time I have seen Lanvin was on a clothing rack at their boutiques - who knew that that they have ventured into this area of their brand. I like the hand cream - which came in handy for the Chicago balmy or windy weather this weekend. The bed...the BED was amazing!!!! It's like sleeping on a cloud of feathers!!! The Mr would have liked some more support but I loved it! The beds at the Four Seasons have been my favorite thus far but now I am torn! We're going to be on the market to shop for beds and I would have to find out if it's a possibility to get one of these for the house! They have a beautiful stairway off of the lobby that makes it a perfect place for photoshoots, and what do you know - when we came back one night and there was a bridal party striking poses. They also have a cool and intimate little lounge/living room area before you get to the bar where my sister in law and I sat conversing by the fireplace. The bar area seems like a very happening place. By the way, they have complimentary wifi! Woohoo! I always have thought that when a hotel charges above average prices that they should include wifi (even if they calculate it into the cost) and advertise as complimentary versus charging guests an additional $20 per day separated. The staff here greets you "Bonjour!", something about being greeted in French makes me want to curtsy lol
