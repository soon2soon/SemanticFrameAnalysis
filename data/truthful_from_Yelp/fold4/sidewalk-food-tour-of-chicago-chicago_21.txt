This tour was so fun! My husband and I live in Chicago and have been wanting to do some more city related activities and this was just the thing! The tour guide is a chef and a resident of Chicago and he was very friendly and charismatic and it was clear he loves Chicago and knows a lot about good food.  He had many fun Chicago facts that he added into the tour and supplemented the tour stops with pictures and diagrams.  The food stops were also very good!  My husband and I loved everything we tried and have even gone back to a few of the places to eat on our own.  I definitely recommend this tour to both Chicago residents and out of town visitors!
