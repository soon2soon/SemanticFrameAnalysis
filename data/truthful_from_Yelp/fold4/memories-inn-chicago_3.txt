We strolled in just after 10 when the kitchen was supposed to be closed. However, the proprietor said it's cold and we need to eat so she stayed open for us! Whaaaaat?! I ordered the pho. I'm glad there's finally another Vietnamese restaurant besides Tank that serves a great bowl of pho! Also, awesome music on the speakers: Destiny's Child, Usher, Rihanna... I'll be back just for the food and service but the jams are another reason to return lol.
