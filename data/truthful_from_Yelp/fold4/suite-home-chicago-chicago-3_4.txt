I've been a long-time customer for more than 4 years. I've stayed in two different locations myself on a month-by-month basis and my team and I at several other locations for a week or weekend. No matter where we are and what the details of our stay, the Suite Home Chicago team treats us extremely well. All of the locations are great and everything is taken care of. I highly recommend Suite Home Chicago!
