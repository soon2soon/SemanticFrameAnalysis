Loved the architectural tour of the Chicago river!  Probably the highlight of my trip. We took a 4pm boat from the Michigan Ave dock on a beautiful Friday afternoon in September.  The gentlemen who gave the tour didn't stop talking from before we left until we got back (about 75 minutes), and he had a lot of great information. I have been to Chicago before on business, but this was the first time I took an opportunity to learn more about the city, it's buildings, and it's history.  I'm really glad I did! We used the Go Chicago multi-day discount passes, which included a Shoreline tour.  It was easy and well worth the cost (when combined with the other sights we hit in our trip).
