This review is for the bar only. Specifically the Bloody Mary. I was ordered to go here. Told I could leave Chicago without having one of the Bloodies here. I actually don't even really care for them. Funnily enough, neither is the person who made the strong suggestion! But he wasn't wrong. In fact, it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. How can something with a long, thick piece of bacon not make something amazing? I mean, really? Â Sitting in the beautifully ornate lobby bar is super fabulous in and of itself. Pop in and check it out.
