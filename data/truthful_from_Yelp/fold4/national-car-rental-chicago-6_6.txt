I absolutely love renting from National at the Midway Airport in Chicago, IL.  Ruby (I hope I got it right) is friendly and a wonderful customer associate.  She has a great personality and will help with whatever is needed.  If eveer I've had an issue, they fix it immediately and get me right back on the road.  The only place I'll make my car rental reservations!
