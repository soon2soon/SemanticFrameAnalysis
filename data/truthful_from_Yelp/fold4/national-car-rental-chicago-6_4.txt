This facility is top notch. It is inside the rental car facility. Bit of a bus shuttle ride to and from airport though. About 8 mins driving time so be prepared to give it at least 10 mins extra or the shuttle total time. All rental counters are on first floor. The National car level is second floor where all the cars are so go to the elevators to the right when you walk in to the rental car facility. This is also where Emerald club service goes to. They always have someone to greet you when you come out of the elevator to point you in the right direction. Drop off is only one location for all airlines which is the top floor where all the ticketing counters are. Return is easy and generally quick. This location is ran like a well oiled machine!
