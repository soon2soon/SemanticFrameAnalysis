As many have said, this is a very clean train station. I've never had any issues here. Of course there are the couple weird times you are relaxing and someone who's been drinking too much comes up to you and asks for directions. But that's kind of a given sometimes that'll happen. Sooner rather than later I'll be going here every day and I don't mind. I feel so safe in this building.
