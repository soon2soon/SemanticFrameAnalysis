GREAT! AWESOME! INFORMATIVE! DELICIOUS! I had a BLAST on the this tour, each stop just kept providing me with new life! Muhammed Ali is so friendly, warm, and informative. I could tell he LOVES what he does. By the end of this tour he felt like a friend of mine, taking around his old neighborhood. I just wish it was a little closer to where I stayed I come back time and time again to keep experiencing the culture. Don't sleep on this tour, get it and you will love it as much as my Fiance and I did. P.S. Come hungry, you will eat, and eat, and drink and leave happy and stuffed!!
