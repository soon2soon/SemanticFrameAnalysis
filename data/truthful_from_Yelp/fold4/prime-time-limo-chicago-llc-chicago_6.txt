This business exceeded my expectations as far as the limo business is concered.  We had a very professional driver named Pat and mentioned certain places where we should take pictures.  The limo was amazing, it was very clean inside and out.  I have used this service many times and they get my vote for being the best.  From making a reservation to the pick up Prime Time Limo Chicago is the best.  We use them for all of our airport runs to nights out of town and for various sporting events and concerts.  Thanks again Pat and Prime Time Limo Chicago.  I'm glad I don't need to shop around for another limo company, you are the best!
