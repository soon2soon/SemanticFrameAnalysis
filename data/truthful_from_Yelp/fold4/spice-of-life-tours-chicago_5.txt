I sooooo enjoyed myself on this culture and food tour!! It was a chilly fall afternoon but a great experience emerging ourselves in the culture of India Â and the food was delicious!!! I got to taste things I would never order and it was Devine !! Our guide was super nice and an expert , so knowledgable !! Can't wait to go back Devon Ave and enjoy everything again!!
