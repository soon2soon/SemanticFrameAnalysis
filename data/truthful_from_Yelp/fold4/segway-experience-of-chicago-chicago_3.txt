I bought a Segway tour for my husbands 28th birthday. It was a great experience from start to finish. When I called to set up the tour the person on the phone was very friendly and quick with setting up my reservation. Immediately after I got off the phone and looked at my calendar I realized that the time I had chosen wasn't going to work out. I called back and they helped me switch to a later time in the day and were very friendly and didn't seem inconvenienced at all. I was a little nervous about riding a Segway for the first time but the guides were very patient and reassuring. They take you out to the park and teach you how to ride them by taking time with each person individually. Casey was our guide and he was great! The tour is very flexible. They take you around to the different sites around Grant Park and give you the freedom to ride around a bit. For example, we stopped at Buckingham fountain and we took pictures and rode around before we moved on to the next location. Overall, this was a great experience and I highly recommend it!
