Had a glitch during my rental. Discussed it upon my return and check out. Both Dion D and Muchael S. (Branch a manger who happened to be at the returns area) were committed to listening and resolving the issue. Great customer service and commitment. Highly reccomend national. It's Low in the garage and makes for a quick in and out.
