My wife and I went on the firework dinner cruise for celebrating our expecting first baby and for having romantic time before baby coming. It was perfect. The staffs were wonderful, the cruise was great, and the night view of skylines and firework were also good. I recommend Blue corn crusted crab cake for the first course.
