Better than any place in Argyle and Hoanh Long on Lincoln. You just have to get pass the weird bar in front. Their Pho is good portion and great presentation. It was also piping hot! The broth was flavorful but didn't leave you super thirsty afterwards. Will have to come back to try their Bun Bo Hue and Banh Mi :)
