I ONLY have great things to say about Scuba Sensations! The owner Rami and his whole caring, informative staff of master divers are like a warm family.  I thought the classes, pool sessions and open water dives were fun, high quality and well organized.  Rami is very generous, patient, knowledgeable and full of funny stories and aquatic wisdom as are everyone who works with him.  There is plenty of laughing but it doesn't overpower the seriousness and importance of the education one gets at Scuba Sensations.  They make sure, once, twice and three times that you know, understand and don't forget what you are being taught.   The classes are small and personal.  WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT!  I will be back with them for more training in the future.  I wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!!
