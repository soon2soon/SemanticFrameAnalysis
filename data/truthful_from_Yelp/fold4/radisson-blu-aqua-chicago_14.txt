Okay so the employees were really nice and helpful. This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in so far! The balcony and the view was so incredible! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel really other than not liking the check in time and the fact that we couldn't check in earlier. We would have liked to stay on a higher floor, but I loved the room we got so it really didn't matter. I love how the room was floor tile instead of carpet! Just amazing would definitely stay here again. It is pretty pricey but worth every bit of it!!!!! Oh and I felt really safe here also love how they make it so you can't enter a floor without your room key!
