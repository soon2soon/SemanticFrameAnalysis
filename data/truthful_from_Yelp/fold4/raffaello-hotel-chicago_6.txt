My mom and I stayed at this hotel one day and night in March 2014 when we were visiting grad schools in the city. We got a room with two full size beds for about $99 which was a steal. This hotel is located right next to the John Hancock Building and steps away from north Michigan Ave. There is a doughnut shop located in the lobby of the building, excellent doughnuts! I enjoyed the the modern bathroom with a rainforest shower head. Wifi was free with our room but was really slow in the evening, worked a lot faster the next morning.
