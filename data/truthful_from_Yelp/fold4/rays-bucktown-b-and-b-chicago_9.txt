Stayed 8 nights here with Ray and the rest of his crew, and despite my deep abiding affection for the monastery b&b in my beloved Pilsen, Ray's Bucktown B&B will likely become my home away from home until I move back to Chicago (and even then I may still make it an annual staycation event). Amazing staff, immaculate quarters, the ready access to a washer and dryer (no additional charge) spares me from having to drag my clothes to a laundrymat mid-week (and if I wanted I could use the detergent they have onsite). Breakfast special every day but if it doesn't meet your fancy, Ray's has a made to order menu, which includes Jake's Country Meats bacon and ham (Iowa farmer who raises pastured pigs and practices no nitrite processing). Lastly, if you can manage it, Sunday is eggs benedict and it is to die for.
