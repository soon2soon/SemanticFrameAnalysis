LOVE!!!! Not only are the Germans generally nice (in my experience) but this airline is super accommodating. When flying to Italy on a 13 hour flight I received 2 hot meals! Not to mention that I was constantly bombarded with stewardess's asking me what type of water I wanted, would I care for a chocolate bar, etc. They really go above and beyond to see that their passengers are well taken care of and it is much appreciated!
