For me, Ogilvie is exactly what it means to be a Chicagoan. Others might disagree and say there are so many other things that capture the spirit of the city, but something about the trains with all the people in their casual clothes and suits keeps reminding me of why I moved here. I love the Metra, I love Garett's Popcorn, Jamba Juice, Dunkin Donuts, Border's and the bars. There is so much to do while you wait for trains and even the people watching is primo. Anytime I'm coming into the city I get excited if my train is pulling into Ogilvie.
