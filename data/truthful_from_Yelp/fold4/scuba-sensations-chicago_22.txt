I went scuba diving for the first time a few weeks ago as part of a Scuba Sensations "Discover Scuba Diving" experience. I was completely impressed with the owner Rami's knowledge and teaching of basic scuba skills. Rami did a great job coordinating and leading the experience for my Â boyfriend and I who were first timers. If you are thinking about trying scuba diving on your next vacation, I would highly recommend paying a visit to Scuba Sensations.
