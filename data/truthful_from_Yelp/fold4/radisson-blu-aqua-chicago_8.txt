I can't say enough wonderful things regarding our wedding we hosted here and our hotel stay. The staff is genuine and went well above and beyond for everything. The hotel is located in a perfect Chicago location with views of Navy Pier, Michigan Ave or the river. You can't go wrong. Every amenity you could ask for. Please stay here, you will not be disappointed.
