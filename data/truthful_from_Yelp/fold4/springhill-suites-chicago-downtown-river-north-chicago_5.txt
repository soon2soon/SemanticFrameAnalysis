This place has a very welcoming atmosphere! The staff was really nice and helpful. We asked a lot of questions about the area and transportation options and they were really patient and told us everything we needed to know. The suite was clean and spacious. It was great for five people - 2 doubles + sofabed. The bathroom is separate from the sink, which made it easier/faster for everyone to get ready. The hotel is right next to a couple of bars, which was awesome for a nightlife. It was also located next to the CTA - red line, which made it convenient for us to travel without a car. I also really enjoyed the complementary breakfast: cereal, fruits, oatmeal, waffles, etc. They also had complimentary coffee, hot chocolate, and tea throughout the day, which I thought was amazing since it was always cold and windy in Chicago. I really, really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to everyone!
