I loved my night in this hotel! I booked last minute through HotelTonight and I got a great deal! The beds are super comfy, there's is a beautiful rooftop bar, and a cute little coffee shop downstairs that also serves beer. Very close to high-end shopping and dining. Highly recommend this hotel.. You can't beat the location!
