We really enjoyed this tour that went from about 11am-2:30pm in River North. Our tour guides, Jake and Aaron, were very friendly and informed. I feel like we got a great architectural tour, history lesson, and food tour. It was pretty warm out, but we were able to go inside and sit down to try the food at Lou Malnati's and Carson's. I thought it was definitely worth the $24 we each paid with the Living Social deal. If it comes up again, I'd love to try the Wicker Park tour.
