Metra is one of the best commuter rail systems in the country, and we're lucky to have it here. Want to take a ride out to Elgin for lunch on the weekend? Buy a $7 pass and enjoy the ride out. Tired from a long bike ride on the Illinois Prairie Path? No problem, take your bike on Metra to get home (check black-out times!).
