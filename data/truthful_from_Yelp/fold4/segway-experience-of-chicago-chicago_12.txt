When my dad was coming to visit me for Thanksgiving in Chicago, he found a Groupon for the Segway Experience of Chicago and, after some convincing, I agreed to take a Segway tour with him. At the end of November. In Chicago. I think Segways are pretty ridiculous looking, and frequently cackle at the people riding Segways around the Loop in large groups, peering down at humble pedestrians (yeah, I'm the worst). I crossed my fingers that no one I knew would see me. We decided to use our Groupon on November 23... Black Friday. We knew enough to bundle up in multiple layers and wear hats/earmuffs and gloves. We arrived a little early to the building (right near DePaul's downtown campus, next to the Corner Bakery Cafe and the Chicago Architecture Foundation), signed some paperwork, and went next door to grab a warm drink and waste some time. Our tour wound up being pretty small - just me, my dad, and one other person who had taken Segway tours before. We watched a little safety video, then our guide, Damian, offered us snowsuits. We all declined - my dad and I are pretty used to the cold, and we had plenty of layers already. We were assigned Segways and brought them out across the street for a little lesson in Segway riding - which is very easy - then we were off! It was freezing, obviously, but that was expected, and the only things that were a problem were my face and, after a little while, my hands - but that couldn't really be prevented. Some of my favorite bits of the tour were riding around the Museum Campus and Soldier Field, and down by the lakefront (though that was the coldest part). Damian was a great tour guide, very friendly and eager to answer any questions. And I have to say, I really loved riding the Segway... But don't tell anyone, because I will deny it.
