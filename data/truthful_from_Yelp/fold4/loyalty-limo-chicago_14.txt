My partner and I were hesitant about the need to rent a limousine on our wedding day, but I was referred to Loyalty Limo by a friend and decided to give them a call.  I spoke to a guy named Vince, who was extremely professional and friendly.  He walked me through the various package and pricing options and discussed the benefits and convenience of their service on an otherwise hectic wedding day.  I was quickly convinced and all the more surprised by the affordability of Loyalty Limo.  I booked the reservation that same day.  Vince even called several times before our wedding day, just to confirm the date and times.  He was really helpful throughout the entire process. On the day of our wedding, the driver David was waiting outside immediately after the ceremony and drove us to the reception.  The package we booked even included complimentary champagne and beer so we were able to start our celebration early!  David was very professional and accommodating.  On the way to the reception our photographer got lost, so David was kind enough to take some photographs for us!  I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of their service. On such a special occasion, Loyalty Limo made our wedding day all the more memorable and fantastic.  We were so pleased that we even booked an SUV with them to drive us to the airport for our honeymoon the next day. I would highly recommend Loyalty Limo for any occasion!  Thanks Vince and David!
