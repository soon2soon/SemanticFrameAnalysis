Worried because it was my first time flying out of Midway, but turned out I had nothing to worry about.  Reserved in advance with no problems.  Shuttle was super fast.  Easier than parking at the airport.  The shuttle picks you up right outside baggage claim and drops you directly at your car.  I never had to wait for the shuttle to the airport or back to the lot.  They have a great system.  Drivers are super friendly. Tip them!
