If I traveled between New York and London and Chicago this would be the only place I would stay. Great restaurants great bar and great service. We went during the soft opening and really had a good time. The drinks were creative and tasty. Refreshing on a hot night. Â I am curious to go back to eat at the restaurants they look really great. I really like this idea if you have to travel to the same city lots of times. A great place that is also Familiar.
