Had a most beautiful dinner cruise on the lake. Katelyn (sp?) was our server along with Amanda, and they were both wonderful. We ordered the filet Mingon and baked chicken. Both were absolutely perfect and delicious. Cannot say enough about how well we were treated as well as how spectacular the views are at night from the lake!
