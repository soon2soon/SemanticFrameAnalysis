I've been on a few different boat tours and this one was by far the best that Navy Pier has to offer. If you have a chance be sure to go on the tour lead by Brian, he is funny and takes no breaks when giving awesome information all throughout the Chicago river. What I really liked was he told you when to "get your cameras ready" and even offers to take pictures of your group with neat backdrops of the city. They Sea Dog gives you a "best of both worlds" tour with the Chicago river slow tour and then it ends with a wonderful boat ride out on Lake Michigan that really lets you see the entire skyline. I've lived close to Chicago for years, and visited the city countless times, but this really gave me a perspective of the city I will never forget. Thank you Sea dog for the awesome tour!
