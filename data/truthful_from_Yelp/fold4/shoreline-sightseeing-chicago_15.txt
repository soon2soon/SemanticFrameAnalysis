Took the Architecture Tour a few days ago while in Chicago and it was so much fun. Tour guide Kevin is a man of all trades, not only does he know his stuff but plays a mean tune before you leave the boat. Kevin makes the trip very enjoyable and points out many things that we take for granted as far as building construction and exterior art. We had a cloudy day so during our tour we started to get sprinkles and at one point half the seats were emptied since I guess we are all afraid of a little rain. They passed out ponchos and we were back enjoying our tour. Nice crew.
