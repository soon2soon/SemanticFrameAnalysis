MySpa is a wonderful oasis in the middle of all the downtown hotels.  I went here as part of spaweek and had the TRU customized facial.  My friend had the 45 min swedish massage.   The facilities are spacious, it takes up a good part of the lower level of the Fairmont hotel.  You have access to the gym and the sauna is perfect for relaxing in after your treatment.  Upon checking in, I was escorted to the locker room and shown the waiting room area. After changing into my robe and slippers I walked over to the waiting room, poured some tea, and filled out a quesionaire on my skintype.  Kristin then came in to escort me to the facial room. The facial was wonderful and very relaxing. During the enzyme mask, Kristen messaged my arms and hands, and towards the end there was a shoulder message.  The mask itself was a mild exfoliating mask that was perfect for waking up and revitalizing my skin.  My friend also had a wonderful experience with the massage, also finding a great person to come back to for future treatments (I didn't get the massage therapist's name). I would definitely recommend the spa to anyone visiting.  Afterwards we went upstairs to the first floor for some of the best sushi I've had in a while (the spider roll was perfect with a light tempura and the spicy tuna was original with a spicy tartare).  I will definitely go back.
