I had a great 4 night stay at the Palmer House and really have no complaints. The front desk staff checking us in were friendly and made the process quick and easy. The room was large, clean, and modern. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet- we were in a corner room on the 20th floor and didn't hear anything. I liked that there's a lot to do in the building- bars, restaurants, Starbucks, and shops. There are also several entrances depending on the street you're on. I got a great rate through hotels.com and so can't comment on it being overpriced. The location was walking distance to everything touristy that we wanted to do, like the Bean, art institute, millennium park, etc. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.
