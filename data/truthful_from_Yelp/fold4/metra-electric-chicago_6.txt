Southshore is amazing! Surely, there is usually drunk people on it during the weekends who are far too loud, but for a $9 train ticket I don't mind. It is always on time, in fact, so early that I get to board early and find a comfortable place to sit. Best part? It's always on time, which is so lovely.
