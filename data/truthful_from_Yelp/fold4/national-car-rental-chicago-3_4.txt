I would like to report excellent customer service from Richard and Darius at the National Car Rental location on LaSalle. This past Thursday, I made a reservation for a compact car for a conference and your team was extremely patient. I had to push my pickup time back several times and due to our large luggage and unexpected passenger we were accommodated with an upgrade. I've been a loyal customer of this branch for years and it is so great to see familiar faces. I do believe this is one of the best branches Downtown and I will look forward to returning soon. Thank you guys for the awesome services
