I knew from the minute I stepped foot out the car onto the sidewalk of the radisson, that I was going to leave a review. Pros Amazing staff Great food *filini* with amazing servers Great room Awesome gym Huge plus it was by a cvs since I literally forgot so much.... Along with running out of diapers for my baby The list goes on about how amazing this hotel was. Three instances that really made me appreciate this place was 1. When they decorated the room for my oldest sons 6th birthday and gave him an awesome cupcake 2. Gave me a complementary fridge in the room to store my pumped breast milk 3. Went above and beyond when one of the valet attendants had a little boo Â boo with my car when parking. I will be back.... Minus the kids and with my husband :)
