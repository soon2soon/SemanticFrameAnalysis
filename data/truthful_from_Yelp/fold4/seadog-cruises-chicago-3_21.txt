This Architecture and Lake Tour is the BEST!  Our tour guide, Jake, did a fantastic job. He encouraged us to point out buildings we wanted to hear more about. He had lots of facts about the Chicago fire, how the city was rebuilt.   This was my daughters second tour and she said each time the guides were fantastic.  I highly recommend the Seadog Cruise - they make it fun~ Cindy in Boise, ID & Kayla from Chicago
