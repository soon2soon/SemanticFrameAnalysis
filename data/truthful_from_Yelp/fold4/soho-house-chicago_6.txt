I ate at the chicken shop, and you simply must try the mac and cheese. I really like the ambiance of the place, and the wait staff was very attentive. I will definitely return to try out other items on the menu. This is a nice place to grab a bite to eat before a night out on the town. This is a great addition to the West Loop.
