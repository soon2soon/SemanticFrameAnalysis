My friends came to visit from Cleveland and I wanted them to be able to stay in the city instead of with me in the suburbs.  The apartment that they stayed in was great.  They have thought of everything that you could need during your stay.  The building was nice and it was only 2 blocks from Michigan Ave.  There was a grocery store and a restaurant in the building and they could walk anywhere that they wanted.  The friends did not want to leave the apartment.  They have already requested to stay there when they come back.  I think that you can use the fitness facilities in the building while you stay there.  The rates are really reasonable compared to what you would pay to stay in a hotel in the area and you would not even have as much room.
