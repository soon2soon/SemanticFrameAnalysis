This is without doubt the best transportation hub, outside of O'Hare, in the Chicago area. Ogilvie is well lit, the temperature is always maintained well, and the space is large enough for the crowds. Entry from both the north and south Â ends gives you plenty of options to avoid the long lines to get into the building during the rush hour. Access to the trains is easy and navigating the platforms a breeze. The beautiful glass enclosure allows plenty of natural sunlight into the building. The ceilings are so high that the building never gets too loud even in rush hour. It would be nice if the escalators weren't so often under repair. The food court in the main floor makes it unnecessary to leave the building for most essentials. The bathrooms are easy to access and very clean with no lines (for men at least). This is one of the architectural gems of the Loop. Good job on the design.
