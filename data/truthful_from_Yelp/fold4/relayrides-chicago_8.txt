So I was hesitant to use RelayRides at first but I heard about it from a buddy of mine that wanted to rent his car out using this app. Well, I'm glad he told me about it. My first experience was great! My uncle and my 2 aunts were in town from Canada and my present car cannot accommodate all of them with two kids in tow. So I said what the heck. I gave RelayRides a try. I love the fact that you can rent and reserve 2 months from now or tomorrow and even the same day if it's available and the owner approves it. So I was in dire need of a minivan. Then I found one! A few in fact. I found Salvador's Sienna on here and he was great to work with. Honest and reliable and the minivan was clean in and out. I hope other owners on here keep their cars clean and in great working order to keep the renters happy and safe. It definitely alleviated any worries I had using RelayRides for the first time. It's also nice to know that you help out regular people like you and me by lending their cars to the public. Talk about ride sharing huh? So screw Zipcars and Igos lol. No need for an annual membership and a decent amount of vehicles to choose from. I for sure will be using RelayRides again in the near future. Thanks for making my experience with you guys awesome! I also recommend using Salvador's vehicle if you ever need to accommodate up to 7 people. Deuces! #relayrides
