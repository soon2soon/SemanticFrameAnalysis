I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel last week when visiting Chicago. Â I got a good deal on the stay and it was right off the Magnificent Mile. Overall I had a great stay. The employees were friendly and the room was clean. I walked to most places and had a lot of food choices in the area. I even bought the hop on hop off bus tour which had a bus stop one block away, which made it very convenient.
