this hotel is in a great location for visiting downtown Chicago.  My wife and I will spend the night or weekend in Chicago 3 or 4 times a year.  MileNorth has become our hotel of choice due to the great location, convenient parking, and friendly staff.  the rooms are not the cookie-cutter type you find at the big chains.  they are interesting, comfortable, and clean.  The hotel is just a block off the Mag Mile, so it is really convenient for shopping, entertainment, and dining.  This summer we walked over to the beach and enjoyed a beautiful day on the lakefront.  the rooftop bar is great.  It was remodelled in the last year and it is a really nice space.  we frequently will meet friends there for a drink even if we are just in town for the day.  We have stayed there several times and have always had a good experience with the staff.  Very personable and helpful.
