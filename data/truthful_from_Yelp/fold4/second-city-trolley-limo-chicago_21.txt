I don't typically write reviews however the service I received from Second City Trolley and our driver for the night, Ali, was absolutely TOP-NOTCH. Ali was able to amaze us with some very epic sights and scenery of the city. He was very polite and accommodating to our group. He had impressive customer service skills and was able to win over everyone within our 20 person group. I recommend Second City Trolley and Ali to anyone looking for an affordable way to celebrate your birthday in very memorable way.
