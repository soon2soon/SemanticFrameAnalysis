This review is for the Mercury Canine Cruise. Living in Chicago we sometimes forget to appreciate everything that makes our city truly amazing. This was the push we needed because where we were able to learn about the city architecture while also spending time with our pooches. The tour guide was great, and we like how they don't discriminate on size and breeds of dogs. Our pooches had a great time sticking their head out the side (like they were riding in a car). We even wrote a bit more about it (with photos!) here: pittiesincity.blogspot.câ€¦
