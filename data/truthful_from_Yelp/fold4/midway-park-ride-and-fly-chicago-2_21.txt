I'm a fan!  I've been using Park Ride and Fly for three years now.  It's fast and efficient.  You drop off your car,  the shuttle picks you up at your car and drops you off at your airline terminal.  When  you come home, you simply send them a text and they come pick up at the airport and drop you off at your car.  Quick and easy and costs the same as a taxi but you get the convenience of driving home. I really needed this service because of the baby car seat. Moms will appreciate this info.
