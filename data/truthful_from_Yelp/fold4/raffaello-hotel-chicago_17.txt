I couldnt have been happier with my stay here.  The rooms were beautiful and spacious and I'd high recommend  booking a suite if ones available.  The rainforest shower is reason enough to stay here, and the staff is incredibly accomodating.  The location-- right behind the hancock building, and two blocks from the lake-- couldnt possibly have been better.   I love smaller boutique hotels, and always have a much better experience at them then in the giant overcrowded lobbies and cookie cutter rooms of the big name chains.   I highly recommend the Raffaello for anyone visiting Chicago.
