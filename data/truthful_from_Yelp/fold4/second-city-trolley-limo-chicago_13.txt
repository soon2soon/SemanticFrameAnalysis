We booked Second City Trolley for our October 19th, 2013 wedding in downtown Chicago.  The communication and professionalism was very good, which lead to a wonderful experience.  We rented the 737 trolley which is specifically used for weddings only, which was nice that you didn't get a trolley that had been used the night before for a pub crawl.  The driver the day of on time (in fact early) and was very courteous while in the trolley.  He even hung our "Just Married" sign on the back while we were in the ceremony.  Afterwards, we got charge an accidental overtime charge, but when I called, they reversed it without question.  Overall, I would recommend Second City Trolley to anyone!
