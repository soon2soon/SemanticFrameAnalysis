Honestly, I love Relay Rides. I think the premise is fantastic and it appears that they do a great job doing a thorough driving history check prior to authorizing users to rent cars. One problem I did run into though was that it required I upload a picture of my old, MD drivers license. Unfortunately, when you go to the MVA to change your drivers license to another state, they take away your old one (I know that at least in MD, it's illegal for you to have more than one driver's license). Lucky for me, I had a picture of my license just because I wanted to remember my old one. I've used Relay Rides twice - once in MD, and once in Chicago. The car I used in MD was a Honda Civic and it got me to and from where I needed to go. Unfortunately though, the AC was working 50% of the time. I told the owner when I got back and he apologized for the inconvenience. I did not get charged for it because he had just gotten the AC unit replaced and perhaps the repairmen had misconnected the wiring. The car I used in Chicago was great. The owner and I walked around the car, she identified already existing problems for us not to worry about, and that was it. Pick up was easy, drop off was easy, car was right around the corner from where I lived, owner was pleasant, and car was gas efficient. Relay Rides charges significantly less for drivers under 25 years of age than any commercial company, which is why I chose them. I would recommend Relay Rides to others if they wanted to plan a trip ahead of time. I would not recommend Relay Rides for someone that needed a car urgently or within the next 24 hours. I will be reusing Relay Rides again, even after my 25th birthday in November. :)
