What more can one desire in a hotel??? It has beautiful rooms, a modern lobby, great views of the city, perfect location, one of the best hotel gyms around, indoor and outdoor pools, and a cheerful and helpful staff! They also offer free wifi. I was only able to stay here for 2 nights and didn't spend as much time as I would have liked at this gorgeous hotel but I will definitely be back. It will be my first choice when I go to Chicago. Rates vary a lot....from around $130 to $400+/night. I was able to book in advance for $180/ngt for my stay. Can I say I LOVE the Radisson Blu? Because I really do. It is one of the very best hotels I've ever stayed in.
