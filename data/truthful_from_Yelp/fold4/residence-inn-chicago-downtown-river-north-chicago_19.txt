No, it's not the Mandarin Oriental.  But when the upcoming and soon-to-be-Elite Yelper Dee Y. offered me the option of couch surfing* and getting some beauty rest in River North (in preparation for my big day at University of Chicago) I had to say yes. This particular Residence Inn has a very new and modern feel to it.  The room was complete with refrigerator, kitchen sink, etc. so Dee and I hit up Jewel like we were contestants on Supermarket Sweep.  Wine and complimentary snacks are served at 6pm and those of us with willpower can head up to the fitness center for a run (not I). The internet connection is surprisingly fast for hotel wifi, the breakfast is extremely substantial (DIY Belgian waffles with chocolate chips, anyone?), and the proximity to all lines on the L all made my life so much easier. * urbandictionary.com/defi…
