Very pleased with my experience! The service was friendly and prompt and my rate was much lower than if I would have parked elsewhere (reserve online ahead of time and google search for a coupon code before checking out). The shuttle picked me up at my car as soon as I parked and when I returned the shuttle was waiting for me as soon as I left baggage claim (I just texted them when I landed). The driver dropped me off at my car and even put my suitcase in my trunk for me! The lot seemed secure to me and my car was in the same condition as when I left it. I read a lot of discouraging reviews for other discount parking options around Midway and I'm happy to say that I had a great experience at Midway Park Ride & Fly and I would definitely use them again in the future.
