I couldn't have picked a better hotel for our first visit to Chicago! My boyfriend and I came from Boston for the weekend. The hotel itself is gorgeous! Clean and modern, just what we like. We were greeted as soon as we got out of the taxi we arrived in by the kind doorman. The service at this hotel was like none other. Every single employee from the front desk to the concierge are nothing but friendly and helpful. We have never had such amazing service at a hotel before. Both the restaurant and bar were great for breakfast and late night drinks. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to the John Hancock building and Michigan avenue for walking to shops and restaurants. There is also a Starbucks about a block down from the hotel. The room was spacious, super clean and again modern. We had great city views from the 23rd floor. The bed was VERY comfortable. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone! If we ever come back to Chicago, we will only be staying here! Thank you to all at the Sofitel, you made our stay memorable!
