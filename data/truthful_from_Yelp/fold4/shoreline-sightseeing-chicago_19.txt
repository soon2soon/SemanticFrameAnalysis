We actually did a architectural tour with another company last year and didn't love it, but since we came with my step son this year and he wanted to do a boat tour we decided to try a different company.  I am so glad we choose Shoreline.   They have tons of boats going through out the day so there is always a convenient time.  They have huge multi level boat that can fit huge tours, but if you sit up top you will have a great view of the skyline, no matter where you sit.   We had an awesome tour guide, Victor, who was informative, funny and just a delight. For us, it was what made this tour so superior over the other company. I would highly recommend them!
