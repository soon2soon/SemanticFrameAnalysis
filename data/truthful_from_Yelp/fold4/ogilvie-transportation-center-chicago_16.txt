Let me set the scene for you. You get out of work late and run until you are blue in the face but you are still two seconds too late and you miss your train. Yeah, that sucks. Lucky for you, you are at Ogilivie station. I am always amazed at how much they have packed into that place. You have so many choices if you are hungry from Mickey D's to Cajun food to Corner Bakery and everything in between. Plus you can look around the bookstore, movie rental place, two bars, etc. You definitely won't be bored while you wait for the next train. (I speak from experience. The bookstore in the station has saved me from total boredom in the past.) Plus, it is the cleanest train station ever. Ogilivie rules.
