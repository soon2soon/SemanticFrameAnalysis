Things I didn't know prior to flying with Lufthansa: -That such good customer service still existed. They make customer loyalty inevitable! -Plane food could taste so delicious My husband and I took a very full flight from Chicago to Dublin, stopping in Frankfurt along the way. We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon, and despite the amount of passengers, they were able to upgrade us to Business Class, with seats in the corner next to each other. The gentleman who took care of us for the evening absolutely doted upon us! He was so kind and gave us more food and drink than we could consume! I walked off the plane, and swore that I wouldn't eat for two days. We had mushroom-stuffed ravioli, cheese trays with wine, champagne, the best olives I've ever had in my life that were definitely NOT from a can, and a very generous breakfast, amongst others. We really could not believe how good the food was, considering that we were on a plane! Travel perk: The seats in Business Class recline to almost an entirely flat "bed," which is REALLY handy for overnight flights where you are going into a timezone that is 6 or 7 hours ahead of your own. I am a pretty price-conscious person, and am constantly on the look-out for deals. But Lufthansa was such a wonderful experience that I would pay more to fly with them again if they were more expensive. We received such excellent, professional customer service. In my opinion, Lufthansa has put other American airlines to shame!
