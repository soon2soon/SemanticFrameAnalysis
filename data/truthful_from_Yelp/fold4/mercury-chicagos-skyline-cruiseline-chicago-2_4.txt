My wife and I did the architecture and lake cruise.  If you are a hardcore architecture enthusiast this is probably not for you.  My wife and I are from LA and just visiting for the weekend.  It was perfect for us.  You get some history and a few jokes.  The views form the lake are incredible especially during sunset.  I highly recommend it for any tourists.
