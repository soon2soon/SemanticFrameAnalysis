We recently spent a week at Ray's BnB and had a great experience.  We stayed in the Cardinal room which was small but comfortable for 2 people with  a simple layout and nice furnishings.   This is an interesting BnB with a large commons area and lots of cool collectables to catch your attention.  The Breakfast is amazing...Pretty much anything you can dream up for breakfast they will make it for you...I was so full each morning all I needed was a mid day snack then dinner....The staff were great, everyone was friendly and helpful...The L was within walking distance through a great neighborhood with great brownstone houses.   We loved our time in Chicago and would stay again....Cheers
