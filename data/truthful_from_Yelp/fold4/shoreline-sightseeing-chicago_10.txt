I highly recommend this tour! Victor, the tour guide knows his stuff. Very informative, funny and interesting. 75 minutes went by fast. I well do it again the next trip to Chicago. Beautiful views of the Chicago skyline and the history behind the architecture of the buildings. Victor had a true passion for what he was doing, and he was awesome!!!!
