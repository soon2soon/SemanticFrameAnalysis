Fantastic food and culture tour! Â I was looking for a fun adventure for my mom and I to have while back in Chicago for the holidays and booked us both tickets on the Spice of Life Tour. I have done a few food tours in Denver and was excited to spend an afternoon out on Devon Avenue. I knew we would be sampling Indian food and learning more about the culture but we truly received a wonderful education and new appreciation for this area of Chicago that often times go overlooked. Muhammad was patient, very informative and very generous with his time as we were his only guest on the tour. We both left very full (be prepared to eat!) after eating delicious Indian Food and are excited to bring other people with us to introduce them to this fabulous tour.
