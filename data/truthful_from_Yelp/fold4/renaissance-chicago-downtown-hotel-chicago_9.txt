One word: OBSESSED. We stayed here over Labor Day weekend and I figured the hotel would be packed, and we'd end up with the scraps. NOPE. Apparently, this hotel doesn't offer lame ass rooms, as all of them pretty much have a view to die for (see picture). They were having a wedding on the patio deck and it was breathtakingly beautiful. We opened the windows to hear a jazz band playing and watched lots of gorgeous people celebrate love. It was perfect. Front desk staff - super friendly. Fabulous bath products. Super comfortable bed and pillows. And if you want ice, a suited gentleman brings you a bucket of ice on a platter and asks if he can make you a drink (whaaaaat?!) And don't forget that stunning view.
