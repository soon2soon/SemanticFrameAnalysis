We used Second City Trolley for our June 15 wedding.  We booked the Orlando Trolley and it was clean and photographed well... perfect for wedding photos.  Our driver was great.  I can't remember his name but he was very nice and excellent at navigating those oh-so-narrow Lincoln Park side streets.  He was on-time and knew how to navigate the city and avoid traffic jams.   Price was a little on the spendy side because the trolley is air conditioned, but I was willing to shell out $200 to not be sweating profusely in my lovely gown.   Overall, they gave top-notch service and I was very satisfied.  Highly recommended!
