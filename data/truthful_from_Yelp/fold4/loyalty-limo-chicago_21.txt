I found these guys on craigslist when I was looking for a limo for my best friends bachelorette party and checked out these reviews but still had no high expectations because I am from Cali and well lets face it everything in Cali is better!! But was I blown away! I even had to suggest they open a business in Cali! We were a group of 12 woman, had planned only 3 stops within the 4 hours but turned into 8 stops for 5 hours because we decided to make some last minute changes and our driver was so accommodating to everything! We went from schaumburg to downtown and back and such a clean wonderful ride filled with so much drinks we didnt need to drink at the club! can you say pregame galore?! Oh and My girlfriend also decided to change her limo service for her wedding last minute to Loyalty Limo and we're about to have another awesome time this weekend! Cant wait!
