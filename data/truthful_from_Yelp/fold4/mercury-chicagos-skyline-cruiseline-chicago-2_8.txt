Yay!  Finally after wanting to do this for the past four years, I had time off of work to go on the Canine Cruise.  I purposely waited for one of the September dates, as this past Summer was just too hot for my liking.   Yesterday's weather was absolutey fantastic.  The tour itself is very touristy.  It is actually the architectural tour that many of the boats offer, cruising down the Chicago River and then heading out into Lake Michigan.  My favorite part was when we were on the Lake portion and the tour guide was taking a break.  The sun was out, it was breezy and I had my boy Romeo with me to take it all in.   It was one of the most relaxing things I have done in a long time.   I just love having things to do with all or one of my dogs.  I think that I will make this an annual event.  Both me and my Romeo had such a great time.
