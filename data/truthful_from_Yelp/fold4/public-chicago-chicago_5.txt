My spouse and I went to Public for a daycation and it was an excellent time. The service provided by the staff was exceptional, from the doorman,  front desk attendant to the manager. The lobby was chic, hip and very tastefully decorated. The room was luxurious and well designed. They even provided a crib for my toddler! The only drawback was the cost for parking -$55! Next time, we'll have to take the train into the city. But, overall,  we had an amazing time. I can't wait to go back and use the bikes they have for guests to use. We'll just attach our kid's seat and ride over to Oak Street Beach,  which is a couple blocks away. :)
