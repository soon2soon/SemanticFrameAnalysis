I booked a trolley for my soon to be sis n law's bachelorette party! I communicated with Thomas for the planning part. He was so nice and was very easy to work with when I had questions or changes in our plans. We rented a 25 person trolley and it was perfect, roomy enough to walk around through but intimate enough we could take pictures, laugh, talk and not have to scream at each other. Salvador was our driver!!! He was amazing! He showed up on the dot at 10:30pm and single handed placed all of our drinks and ice into the beer tubs and coolers. He had called me earlier in the day to confirm pick up location and asked questions about the night we had planned. He was very knowledgable about the streets in the city and when our plans changed he moved fast and without hesitation. My sister n law, at the last minute decided she did want to do the museum tour! In a blink of an eye, Salvador said "it's so easy, let's go!" In the end we were so glad we did, we took some cool pics with the city behind us. He even took pictures for us of the group! We were able to play our iPods from our phones, but really the mix he had playing we were happy with and the sound was great! After driving around awhile and not having stopped yet he swung through a gas station and we were able to have a pit stop. During the time we waited for everyone, he chatted with us and he was just a great guy!  A big thanks to Salvador for putting up with 15 tipsy girls who threw out their original plans out and just went with it. I hope he sees this because at the end my bachelorette said in a tipsy voice "can we do this next weekend too" He definitely contributed to her fun! When he dropped us off he hugged us and told the bachelorette  "congrats" he looked sad to leave us!! Haha, and with a wave he was gone! Great customer service!! Beginning to end!
