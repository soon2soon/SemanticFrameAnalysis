This is a truly lovely hotel.  It has old style charm with modern conveniences. It is located across from the Drake in an excellent part of the city.  Just about every major attraction is within walking range or a short cab ride.  The room was clean and very comfortable.  The bathroom was great with a spa shower and euro toilet (that was mounted at a perfectly reasonable height and I am only 5'5".  Maybe the past reviewer got a weird room.)  The Martini bar is fabulous, both food and libations.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful; the cleaning staff especially. I spent a week here and enjoyed every minute of it.
