We came in after finding out that the pho place we were planning on going to was closed. As other Yelpers have said, the first impression was, "Are we in the right place?" Eastern Euro bar in front, Vietnamese food in back. The music was a bit on the loud side, but the waitress and owner could not have been nicer. We had the sausage spring rolls, which were very tasty. The rare beef pho was awesome. I would encourage you to try it out!
