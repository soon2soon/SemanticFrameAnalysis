The building is not shiny and new like some other glistening towers in Chicago, but keeps it's own identity.  First off I love places like this--historic buildings that are renovated/ updated for today.  If you decide to stay here remember that every room is different, and finding a plug may be a task, but how much time are you going to be spending in your room with the Hancock building and the the Magnificent Mile staring you in the face?   If there is something in a room you are not quite satisfied with just call down and ask.  We travel a lot and they have a very accommodating staff.  Our room was great!  Spacious.  The entire hotel is styled in a modern Euro/ Mediterranean style.  The rainforest shower head is amazing.  We even stayed an extra night.
