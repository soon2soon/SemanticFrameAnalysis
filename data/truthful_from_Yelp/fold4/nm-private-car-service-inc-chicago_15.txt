This car service is the best! It was a perfect process from beginning to end. Neil was amazing, and patient, answering every question to every email, (and I did send several). Neil is very professional and a complete pleasure to work with, paying attention to every detail, and all my requests. Our driver, Bernie, was also wonderful. He made sure we were completely comfortable, the SUV was great, his timing for pick-up and drop-offs was impeccable and so was his driving! Great service, very affordable and and completely well managed. I want to highly recommend NM Private Car Service for all your transportation needs. I will surely use them again. Thank you Neil and Bernie for helping make our city "adventure" easy and fun!
