My wife, son and I decided to stay here for a summer "staycation". Upon approaching the building, not 25 feet from the door, we're greeted by the doorman. His warm smile and "hello" were a great way to walk in. The desk staff was friendly and accommodating. Kristen in the lounge was great too. I was just blown away by how they make you feel so welcome. We had a suite and was incredibly lavish. I can't wait to stay here again. This place is top notch!
