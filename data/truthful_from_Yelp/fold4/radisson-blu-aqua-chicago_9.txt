I've stayed at many Radisson's, but Radisson Blu Aqua is amazing!  Prime location, beautiful hotel (inside and out), and great service!   Chicago has amazing architecture and RBA does not disappoint!  I loved the welcoming, modern feel of the foyer.  I wish we got the chance to enjoy the fireplace.  The staff is very friendly and was always asking if we needed a cab.  On our last morning, I saw that they were lending out umbrellas to some guests.  Our park view room had an amazing view of the city.  Millennium Park is literally down the street!  RBA is pretty much walking distance to many great eateries and things to do.   I was so bummed out that I didn't pack any workout gear!!!  The fitness room was well equipped with a lot of machines, weights, and kettle bells!  I was itching to get in and start working out!  Instead, the hubs and I went to the jacuzzi and pool.  Nice place to relax.  It was clean and even had an ipod dock so you can play your own music!   The staff was nice and friendly.  Our check-in and check-out was painless and fast.  The free internet was actually pretty fast, too!  Everything about the hotel was beautiful and didn't put too much of a dent in the pocket.
