The Spice of Life tour of Little India was so much more than a simple tour of a place.  We learned, we touched, we smelled, we TASTED (a LOT of food and drink), we listened, we experienced such richness.  Everything from amazing food from all Indian regions, to trying on Indian clothing, to visiting a Sikh temple... it was a wonderful, kaleidoscopic journey that was the next best thing to actually going to India.  Mohammad was a perfect host.
