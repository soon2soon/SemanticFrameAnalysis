This review is for the Hoffman Estates location. I decided to go here rather than the giant local hospital, and it was a decision well-made. My nurse and I spent the entire appointment laughing, product and vaccine recommendations never crossed the line to being forced sales, and I got what I needed, except for what I didn't have time for. Main points: 1. The earliest appointment I could get was two days from my phone call. 2. NO INSURANCE - cash, check, or credit upon leaving. (Side note: this can get expensive. If you're doing a full series of Japanese Encephalitis or Rabies, those go $300+ per shot (JE is 3, Rabies 2)) 3. $10 discount on the office fee if you're a student, missionary, or senior citizen. (yay!) 3. Yes, they make you watch a video, and yes, it is ridiculous; However, I did learn two things - apply lotion, sunscreen, and repellant in that order, and a hilarious rhyme that will stick with me forever (it distracted me from reading my Hepatitis A handout!) "Malaria bites from dusk til dawn, but everything else bites all day long." Oh, yeah.
