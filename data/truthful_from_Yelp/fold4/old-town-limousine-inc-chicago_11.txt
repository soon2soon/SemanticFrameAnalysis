I have been using Balal as a driver to and from the airport and other work events for several years, after another car service kept getting less and less reliable. I'll never use another service again! Why? * His cars are incredibly clean and well maintained. * He is always on time, if not early. If he's early, you can find him right outside your door buffing up the shine on his car. * He helps you with your luggage and the door. I know car services are *supposed* to, but more and more I've found that they don't always. He does! * He's always courteous, polite and did I mention on time? It's a thing for me. * If you feel like talking, you can chat. If not, his car has *comfortable* silence. Other cars I've been in have right-wing-AM-radio silence, listening-to-the-driver-have-a-fight-on-their-Â­cellphone silence, or staring-at-you-in-the-mirror silence. None are comfortable. Balal is a normal person who just happens to own a car service. * The rates are totally reasonable. * He has access to several car sizes depending on your needs. Sometimes for work I have to have several people go at a time and he can provide for any size that I've had (from one to eight, no problem). * When I call last minute with small changes or ask for the drop-off address to be different, or drop a group of people off in a different order, he always has the same response: "sure, sure." We've forged a good business relationship now and I can't recommend him enough. Don't let the address fool you, he's available to provide service downtown, to and from the airport, we've even had him drive a group out to the Q Center a few times in St. Charles. My only fear in writing this review is that everyone will realize how amazing he is and I'll have trouble booking him. :)
