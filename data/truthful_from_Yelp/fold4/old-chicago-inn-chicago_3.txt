dave and virginia were beyond accommodating during our stay at the old chicago inn. from arranging a romantic birthday surprise for my boyfriend to giving us tips on things to do in the area, we couldn't have been happier. we will definitely be back, probably sooner than later. i will recommend this place to anyone i know who is travelling to the area and is looking for a place with charm and character. jk and dl worcester, ma
