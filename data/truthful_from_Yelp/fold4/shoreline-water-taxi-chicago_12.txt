Right out of the gate let me exclaim that if you haven't done the Water Taxi thing then you have NEVER truly seen Chicago. I say this as a resident who has always intended to see the City from this unique and yet obvious vantage point but somehow never quite made it happen. Until recently. And I realized that I am not exactly an anomaly; most Chicagoans have not seen their city from the river.  We are all so immersed in expediting the getting from point A to B that the street canyon route has been the default behavior. In this regard we are missing out on a very good thing, if not life itself. I took the Shoreline Water Taxi from the base of the Mag Mile to the Union Station/Sears Tower stop and back.  A beautiful autumnal day in pre-autumn September (2009 has provided Chicago with truly memorable conditions to be out and about without suffering from the more typical sticky heat of summer).  The cityscape simply stuns.  It begs so many questions that the obvious next step would be to arrange to take the Chicago Architecture Foundation's guided tour from the same water-borne vantage point. That is next on my agenda. The round trip cost from Michigan Ave to Union Station is $6 per ($3 one-way).  So, it is very much a value proposition and far lower in cost than a taxi and far more attractive circumstances.  The short trip is simply an extraordinary vacation from one's otherwise hectic day and life.  If you visit Chicago and leave your water-framed impression of the cityscape to a somewhat distant Navy Pier view, your impression will be severely lacking. If you are a Chicagoan and you haven't done the river view thing, then you have a gaping hole in your residential actualization. If you profess to imparting your sense of Chicago as an architecturally iconic city and you haven't done CAF's river tour, then you are simply sharing your ignorance with others.
