Had Such an AMAZING time!!  The food was amazing!!! I will be back for the Butter Chicken and for the Samosas. The tour started with Samoas and this refreshing Mango Lassi and Sugar Cane drink.   Two of my friends did the henna tattoos, So PRETTY!  I loved the Gluten Free options as well. The wine was great with the Masala Dosa .  I will definitely be back on this tour. If you love FOOD then this tour is for you!
