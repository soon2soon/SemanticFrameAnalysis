Went on the River North tour with Aaron as our guide and it was fantastic, I have zero complaints! Even though I've lived in Chicago for 3 years, these were all places I have never gotten the chance to try and the food was so delicious. Aaron knew his stuff, I learned a lot, he was very friendly and funny, I look forward to taking the Wicker Park tour next! I definitely recommend this to visitors as well as Chicagoans!
