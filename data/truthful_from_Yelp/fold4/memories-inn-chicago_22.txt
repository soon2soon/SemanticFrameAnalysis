Truly good food at a great price! As a beef-eater, their Turkey Burger puts most beef paties to shame. Not kidding. It was huge, it was good, and it came with really good seasoned fries. Wide variety of food including Italian, Mexican, American, etc. Atmosphere was intimate, CLEAN and full of welcoming people. Great place to take a date and/or hang out. Good music too!
