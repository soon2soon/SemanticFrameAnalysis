Ogilvie to Palatine tonight. Track 6. 5:16pm Express Metra. It was 5:14pm and a dude hands me a pamphlet about the train being a quiet car during rush hour. Excuse me? We hadn't even left the station yet. I can't call my Mother to let her know I'm on my way? Shush yourself and mind your own... Overall, it's a pleasant experience and a nice ride. You hardly ever run into someone who is an Asshole. I wouldn't trade what happened tonight for waiting on a platform. I avoid Clybourn station. It's scary standing there on any given time of day. Â  Ogilvie is clean. It's safe. It has food, bars, restrooms and shops. It's warm in winter and cool in summer. The price is reasonable. $8 for buying my ticket on the train. It took 45 minutes to get off at the Palatine stop and walk to my Aunt's row house on the other side of the tracks for dinner. Can't beat that!
