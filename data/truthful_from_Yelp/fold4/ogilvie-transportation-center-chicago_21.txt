Gotta love OTC. It kinda feels like a mall with all the shops, the food court, and the restaurants. I really like that I can get a haircut, a smoothie, a new cell phone, eat sushi, oggle beautiful lovelies in business or casual attire & holler at them, and have drinks with said lovelies at a bar, all of which are just steps away from the train. This is definitely my favorite train station. Holla!!!â„¢
