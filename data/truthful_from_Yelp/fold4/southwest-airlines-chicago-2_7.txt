There's not many negative things I can say about southwest. It's been my airline of choice (and what I fly 90% of the time) for years. I also have the southwest credit card. I use it for EVERY single purchase, and as a result- I rack up the points that go towards free flights. Love that you're allowed free checked bags! And they mail me so many free alcoholic drink coupons! I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience with a southwest employee. You can tell they actually enjoy working for this airline. I've received so many drinks "on the house", and if I ever had to call customer service (and yes they are Americans that speak good English, unlike some other airlines!) they always pick up right away and answer any questions with sincere kindness. I guess it's kind of a pain to have to line up when your group is called and not have an actual seat assignment- but on the bright side, it allows you to "pass by" that undesirable passenger and not be forced to sit in close quarters with them. Then again- with all of those free drink coupons, I might be THAT passenger lol. Thanks southwest for always providing outstanding service, free bags & of course free drinks!
