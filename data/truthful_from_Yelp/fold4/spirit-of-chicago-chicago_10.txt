I'm writing this review for the Entertainment Cruises company as a whole...you'll see why later. I had my bridal shower on the Spirit of Chicago in Sept of 2012 and everyone LOVED it. We had a Sunday brunch cruise and all of my guests couldn't stop raving about the whole experience. Originally we were scheduled on the Mystic Blue for the Sunday Brunch but for some reason we had to be moved to the Spirit of Chicago. Now as a bride-to-be you would think I would be freaking out, lol. Nope, the entire staff at Entertainment Cruises was extremely helpful, calm, and apologetic. Even though the Spirit is more expensive than the Mystic, they didn't up charge us and they even comped our entire group 2 drinks. WOW. Talk about customer service. I was definitely not mad, more excited since I knew the Spirit was a "better" boat! Only down side was that I had to inform my guests after I had sent out invites, but that wasn't a major issue in the end. The day of the cruise was great. It was a bit windy but hey, that's Chicago! The food was okay. Typical brunch foods but I wish they had more of a variety. They had two lines going so it moved fast. The staff were accommodating and very warm. Kinda cheesy with some of their on-board entertainment with the DJ but it was fun. Overall, I felt like Entertainment Cruises did a fantastic job with handling the situation. Great customer service. Highly recommended for any event or special occasion!
