My experience with Scuba Sensations includes the PADI Open Water Diver course, gear consultation and purchase, and the Open Water Dive Certification. Every class and every transaction was a positive, human experience. I always look forward to visiting the shop whether it is for a purchase, gear fitting, or practice a scuba skill. Rami helped me select the best gear for me, which I appreciated since I had never considered dive gear before. The classes taught me to be a self-sufficient, safe diver and I had a ton of fun learning scuba and meeting people in my local community. Rami's classes go above and beyond what PADI requires by teaching best practices which make diving more comfortable and fun. You are learning when you don't necessarily realize it, and you are certainly prepared to embark confidently as a new diver. I am thrilled with the prospect of diving and would recommend anyone considering gear purchase or classes to consult with Rami before making a final purchase/decision.
