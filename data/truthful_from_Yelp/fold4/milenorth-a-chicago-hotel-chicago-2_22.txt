Spent our 24th Anniversary evening at the Mile North, what an outstanding place!! I spend a great deal of time in all kinds of hotels, this place is head and shoulders better than most big name places! Super friendly staff, neat bar and restaurant , great location, clean, comfortable rooms, we really were thoroughly pleased!! Â We will definitely be back!
