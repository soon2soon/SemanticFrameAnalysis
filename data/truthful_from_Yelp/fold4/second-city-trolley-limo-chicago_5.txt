I just used Second City Trolley for my wedding.  It was a terrific experience!  Their customer service was terrific; it was easy to contact them and reserve the trolley, they were clear in their costs, I called to confirm and everything was fine.  We rented the Tango trolley for 4 hours and it was waiting for us when we exited the church.  The driver, Ali, was awesome!  He had picked up some buckets full of beer and ice at no extra charge!  I had previously mentioned that we would have beer and sandwiches that we needed to keep cold, so I knew that there would be ice, but the beer was an added bonus.  He drove wherever we asked him to and even stuck around about 10 minutes after our time was up because we were a bit behind schedule.   My one caution is the capacity of the trolleys that are listed online.  We had 30 people on the Tango (listed at capacity 38) and it was comfortable.  We probably could have squeezed 2 more people on the trolley in wedding clothes and managed, but there was no way that 38 people in wedding clothes were going to sit on the trolley comfortably with beer and sandwiches.  I think the capacity must include people that are standing.   Because we fit perfectly, the day and the trolley company were delightful.  I would recommend their service to anybody.
