Had a great stay at this place. The staff is great. Complimentary drinks downstairs and water in the room. Very spacious rooms and comfortable beds. The bathroom is huge with a bathtub and shower. Towels that are actually big enough to dry yourself with! Motor operated window shades with a great view. The jacuzzi and pool are great and they have a great fitness center.
