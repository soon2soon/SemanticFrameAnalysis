When I first moved to Chicago, I was fascinated by these double decker trains with diesel engines and dignified bells ringing to warn you of their approach.  I was hooked from day one.  I guess I'm a bit of a train nerd - I really, really enjoy riding Metra.   The conductors wear old-timey uniforms and punch your tickets.  The trains are ON TIME nearly ALL OF THE TIME and they tell you when a train is late, give you the reason, and tell you how late it's going to be.   It's clean and comfortable, and a great way for me to get to work.  Yes, it would be nice to introduce automated ticket machines and offer a better 10-ride purchasing system than the half-assed "Ticket by Internet" that involves you mailing them a canceled check, but I won't take away stars for that.
