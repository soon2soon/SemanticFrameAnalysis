We just celebrated our wedding on Saturday, July 26th with Second City Trolley getting us to and from the church in raucous style!   My wife and I were scrambling for a trolley two weeks before our wedding and Thomas was able to accomodate us with the Iowa trolley that fit up to 30 people at a reasonable price.  Thomas was very prompt and courteous at getting back to us.  We were lucky to have the Iowa trolley since we used every inch of space.   The driver Nick was very prompt and an excellent driver.  He had the difficult job of manuevering through the busy streets of downtown Chicago and did it with clear expertise.  Again, Nick was on-time and even filled the two coolers available on the trolley with ice for us.  Not that he offers this service as well, but Nick was kind enough to run to the store for us to get us two more cases of beer!  He was a lifesaver!  The audio hookup in the trolley was excellent as well.   Again, I would highly recommend Second City Trolley if you're planning a special event in the future and need prompt and second to none party transportation.
