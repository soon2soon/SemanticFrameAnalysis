I have been lucky enough to spend lots of time in Ray St. Rays company. He is delightful each and every time you interact with him. Its always a new and entertaining expierence. Really, look him up and have him take you places- he will regale you with wonderful songs, intelligent conversation and pithy one liners. And hes adorable. I never thought that I would ever say that there was a cab driver that I wanted to marry, make sweet love to and have babies with, but for about 6 months last year I harbored some very dirty fantasies about Ray St. Ray!
