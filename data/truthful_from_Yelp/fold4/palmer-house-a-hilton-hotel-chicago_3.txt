Tired of cookie cutter hotels? Enjoy history and architecture? This is the place to stay. While the rooms may lack a few things like a mini-fridge and coffee maker, they make up for it with charm and comfort. While you can't miss the amazing lobby, don't forget to check out the main floor museum while you are here.
