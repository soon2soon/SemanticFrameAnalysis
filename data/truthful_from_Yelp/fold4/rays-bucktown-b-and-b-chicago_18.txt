Best. Friendly staff, amazing layout and design of the building, amazing food, great location. I had not a single complaint. I normally only stay at starwood hotels (not to sound to snotty) and I would rather stay here then any one of their locations, anytime of the year any day of the week. I stayed for about a week in january and even tho there was a good 3 feet of snow on the ground It was a good location to still go out and enjoy the area. Also there was one day that the snow was so bad I didn't go out and it was honestly divine to lay in bed and watch t.v all day. I can't even begin to say how great it was.
