My girlfriend and I decided to book our stay here at the Radisson Aqua Blue Hotel while we were visiting Chicago. The location was awesome, because everything was in walking distant for us whether it was to Michigan Avenue, Chicago River, the lake, Shredd Aquarium, and Willis Tower just to name a few. The architecture of the building itself is pretty nifty. The lounge area is very bright, warm, and golden. There's even a little art gallery. Our room was clean and spacious. It provided everything we needed andddd there was Free Wi-Fi for hotel guests. Finally, the staff here is very friendly and courteous. Â  I would highly recommend this place to others!
