What a great way to travel in Chicago! When the CTA can't get you to where you need to go, the Metra is a great option. Trains were on time, relatively clean, quiet and an overall enjoyable mode of transportation. We ran from Ogilvie to Arlington Park and back and it was well worth the weekend day pass.
