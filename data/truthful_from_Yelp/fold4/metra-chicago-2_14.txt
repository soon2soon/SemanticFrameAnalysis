Holy smokes--up until this weekend, I've had no need to ride anything but CTA which is what it is.  I've gotten used to the rhythms of public transportation in this city based solely on the Red Line.  Who knew there was the joy of Metra sitting there so close. Bought a "weekender" for $5 (SERIOUSLY...mile per mile, this far exceeds anything CTA has to offer!) and schlepped all the way out to Geneva and back.  I felt like it was a steal.  Any other form of transport out that way would have been way more expensive and likely would have involved some level of road rage. Everything was really nice: people, environs, and time schedule.  Of course, this was a one shot deal for me so I can speak nothing of consistency or longevity.  What I know is that I'll never hesitate to use it in the future.  SO, SO EASY. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio, where public transportation is something people laugh about as a joke...this "other" rail system here to the 'burbs just blows my mind.  Well done, Chicago.
