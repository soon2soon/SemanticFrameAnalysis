I booked Second City for a bar hopping trolley for my best friend's bachelorette party.  Her party was on Saturday night and we were really, really pleased with the service.  They answered any questions I had prior to the event, called to confirm, our driver was on time and very pleasant, and the entire trolley ride went without a single hitch.  Thanks Second City!  I will always recommend you!
