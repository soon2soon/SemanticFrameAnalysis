My husband brought me for Mother's Day. (We celebrated a day early). Our experience at The Odyssey was unreal!!! We LOVED the experience. Wonderful customer service from the staff. The food was delicious. Sean, our server, was unbelievably sweet. David, the man in charge of music, was awesome! It was an incredible experience and we recommend it. We hope to return soon!
