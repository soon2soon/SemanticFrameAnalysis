I don't know what it is about Southwest, but I love them. Maybe I am seeing it a bit differently because I am the A-listed member due to my frequent business travel. I like the flexibility to seat where you wish, the pleasant crews, the crews that are often funny, joke, sing songs etc....and it is not expensive. It is a solid airline :)
