Been to The Allis (bar/lounge at a Soho House) twice at night for drinks and once for breakfast. Big fan of the vibe at Soho House. It's trendy yet not pretentious. LOVE the table of food next to the bar!!! I like walking up to the table to see what they have that I can order. Even when I have no intentions of getting food when I'm just there for drinks, the table of food makes me want to eat and that's what I end up doing. The whole food table display concept is so down to earth. Reminds me of Jamie Oliver. There are very few places where I rave about the old fashioneds (Bavettes is my #1 fav) and The Allis makes a mean one too. I look forward to more visits.
