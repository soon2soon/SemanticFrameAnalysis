Thanks to Groupon.com, we took a 2-hour morning sail a few weeks ago with Lucky Dug Sailing on Captain Tom and Kristi's BEAUTIFUL and brand new (50 ft ?) sailboat. There was only a total of 8 of us on the boat, and it was great to be on a real boat and have space to spread out. While some people might not care about this, I want to also note that there were two clean and real toilets on the boat (you trying being a girl who drinks tons of water and needs to pee ever 47 minutes - toilets are important!). Tom and Kristi were very friendly and it was as close as one can get to hanging out with rich friends - but like cool rich friends (is there such a thing?). You could bring your own drinks and snacks, and basically hang out on your own and pretend that somehow you don't have a day job to go back to where you are lucky if you even have a view of the lake. Douche Warning: If you like boating where you hang out in a too-small bikini, drink excessively, and the boat is completely run by a motor, then this is probably not your scene. Your are better off with some guys from Michigan who went in on a boat together and now hang out at the play pen, where sunscreen, condoms and penicillin are must-haves. In sum, even if you can't get a great deal for sailing like we did on Groupon, it's still not that expensive and a great way to spend 2 hours.
