The experience of scuba diving with Scuba Sensations exceeded my expectations far beyond what I could have ever imagined. I started my certification with pool dives and classroom training in Chicago and finished my certification on a trip through the shop in Roatan, Honduras.  Everyone I met, from Rami, the owner of the shop, to the dive masters to the people on the trip, were amazingly supportive, fun, funny, down to earth and friendly.  I went into the scuba trip with people I hardly knew, had one of the most amazing experiences of my lifetime, and left the trip feeling like I had a scuba family. Thanks to Rami and the crew at Scuba Sensations, becoming scuba certified was easy AND fun.  The trip to Honduras was coordinated so well and the people were incredible - it truly was one of the best trips I've ever taken.
