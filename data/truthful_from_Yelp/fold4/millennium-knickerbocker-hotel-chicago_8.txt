Fabulous hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. A couple blocks from the lake front, couple blocks from Hancock Tower. I loved the overhead rain shower. The hotel bar is the place to be on a Friday night, the jazz band was AWESOME and the bartender makes rockin Martinis and Irish Mules. Hotel room doors are a bit loud, but great place altogether.
