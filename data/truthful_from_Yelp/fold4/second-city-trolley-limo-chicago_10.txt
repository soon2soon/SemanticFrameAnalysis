I'm not one who really loves a bar crawl, so when I was asked to organize one I wasn't really sure where to start. We had a great experience with Second City Trolley. Our driver, Eric, was friendly, prompt and (most importantly) patient! I can't imagine being at the helm of a vehicle full of drunks like that. The trolley was clean, the AC worked, the sound system was just loud enough. Reservations were easy, and customer service was excellent.
