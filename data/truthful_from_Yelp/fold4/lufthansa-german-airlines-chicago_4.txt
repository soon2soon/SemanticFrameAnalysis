This was my first international flight, so I'm not sure how many of these things are par for the course, but I was a pretty happy camper flying with Lufthansa. International flying had always been a worry for me, since I have a slew of stupid problems: 1) I'm tall...but I have to fly economy...because dollars. 2) I have the attention span of a five year old 3) I've never been able to sleep in anything other than my dark, quiet, cozy bedroom. But when work offered me the chance to go to Europe for free...I jumped on it. All of the lovely things: - Good food - and plenty of it - Free liquor - woohoo! - Wonderful staff - especially the flight attendant who came around and asked if we wanted a bailey's on the rocks after dinner. Turns out...yes...yes I do. - Great movie/music/TV selection - Moderately comfortable seats - AND with the aid of a sleeping pill and some melatonin, I slept peacefully almost all the way over the Atlantic. Five stars all the way.
