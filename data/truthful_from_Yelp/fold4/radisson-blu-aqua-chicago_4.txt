Stayed here 3 nights for our honeymoon. We upgraded to a business package that included free continental breakfast that was delicious, free access to fitness center etc. The service was great! The bathrooms were newly remodeled on the 17th floor and I always look for clean , snazzy bathroom for romantic gateway. The tub is big and shower lovely. The bed was comfortable and sheets so nice! The room style is minimalistic, modern. This hotel has balconies (upgrade room) which is great for fresh air or any smokers. The Italian restaurant on the first floor was so good! Not many vegetarian options but the tricolore appetizer, artichokes and spinach pasta were delicious! The semifredo chocolate desert was so good too. I'd go back just eat! The outdoor area was nice for hanging out- they have grills you can grill your own dinner! Gym area has small basketball court and there is media center where I think you can load and watch your own DVDs (like a mini theatre). The location is walking distance from millennium park -just like 2 blocks and state street shopping- about 4 blocks. There is even a CVS right next door for snacks or whatever you may need. If you like clean, modern and good service this is the place.
