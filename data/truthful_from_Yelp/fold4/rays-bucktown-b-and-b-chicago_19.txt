This review is long overdue, but I was recently talking about my trip to Chicago for Pitchfork Festival last summer and remembered I had to give Ray's a shout-out.   I really wanted to stay at a B&B in one of the neighborhoods, not a cookie-cutter hotel in or around the Loop and Ray's had one room available when I decided, unreasonably close to the date of the festival, to book a room.  The room was in the Annex which, as others have noted, wasn't glamorous, but it was more than adequate, with a comfortable bed and clean everything, and the price was certainly right.  Annex rooms weren't entitled to the prepared breakfast (apparently a zoning/licensing thing), but Ray provided plenty of baked goods, fruit, yogurt, etc., plus free bottled water, which was very much appreciated during the long days in the sun at Union Park. The key for me was the feel of the place--tending towards artsy, but without the rough edges that that can imply.  Plus the neighborhood is fun, with some good restaurants and bars nearby.  Basically it was a fun place and Ray was a super nice guy.  He even let me borrow his bike to get back and forth from the show--awesome!  If I go back to Pitchfork I'll definitely be staying here.
