I have stayed in a lot of hotels. I have never written a review though I have been in some amazingly fancy places. However I just had to recognize the fact that Every single employee at this hotel is genuinely kind. Every single person that passed by me whether at the front desk, elevator or hallway always said Hello and have a good day, evening etc. I have never seen so many people in one place so wonderful to everyone! They locked up my gear in their office while I wandered the city a bit on my last day. I stay in Chicago at least every other month. Loved this location. Right across from Top Chef Fabio's new place, Siena Tavern. A block from Rick Bayliss restuarants and a dozen other great choices for food just steps outside the front door. The lobby is beautiful. Lots of chairs and couches. Free internet and free breakfast!
