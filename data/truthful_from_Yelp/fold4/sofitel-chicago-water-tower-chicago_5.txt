Bravo Bravo Bravo Wonderful experience. The staff at the Sofitel really put the guest experience as their #1 objective.  We had some requests at check-in and additional requests as our 2 night stay continued.  The staff was prompt and outstanding in their professional attitudes.  I was so pleased I stayed an additional night despite numerous nearby options. The rooms are modern, the desk chair very comfortable, and the bed so nice and cozy.  I especially appreciated the quiet of the hotel.  One of the best parts was the gorgeous bathroom.  With a large tub perfect for a bubble bath, a separate marble shower, a lovely sink area, and a toilet tucked in the back it was so very nice.  I suggest different art work for the bathroom.  All the other art work is modern and lovely. Highly recommend a stay here.
