Very interesting afternoon.  Mohammad is an excellent tour guide and incredibly knowledgeable.  The food was varied as were the stops.  While we have eaten on Devon many times, even at some of the same establishments the tour visited, we tried new dishes and gained a better understanding of the regional differences in Indian cooking.  We highly recommend the tour.
