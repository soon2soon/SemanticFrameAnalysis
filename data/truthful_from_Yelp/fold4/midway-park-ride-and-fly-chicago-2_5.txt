We used this lot for the first time over the weekend. We usually fly out of O'Hare so were not familiar with what Midway has to offer in terms of parking. I have to say the service was OUTSTANDING! Just the fact that when we walked out of the terminal there were 2 busses waiting is enough to give it 5 stars. We didn't have to call anyone or wait or walk across a busy street to catch the shuttle. The drivers were polite and more than helpful especially when we got to our car and it was covered with a thin sheet of ice. The driver got right out and helped my husband scrape. I can't say enough about this service! AWESOME!
