Great location just off Michigan Avenue, the rooms are modern urban funky style with spacious glass showers. Near the Hancock tower, right next to a Giradanos (?) Pizza, with a parking garage right across the street. My wife and I have stayed here several times, and we're always happy when hotwire sends us to the Milenorth.
