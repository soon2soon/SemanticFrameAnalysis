Alert, Alert! Major shopping center!!! This would make any traveler happy.   When I think of train station, I really think, in and out and out and about. No, Ogilvie is filled with many shopping centers for you to take your time to walk around and shop til you drop!  They had a Berry Chill (my brothers favorite), Jamba Juice (BF's favorite), Corner Bakery ( my favorite), Walden Books (LIttle Girls favorite), etc. As you can tell, it suits interest from all ages.  If I were a tourist, I would definitely spend some time in here to grab a quick bite to eat, grab dessert, and walk around to look at all the venues located in this conveniently place. I have traveled to Union station before and I have to tell you, that place is more confusing than here. I guess it could be because the Metra and Amtrak are al in one building (that really confused me when I had to take both one time) Ogilvie is also easy for anyone that needs to take a cab immediately after.  You walk out one door and there are cabs. Whereas, the Union Station, you have to walk out the right doors to grab a cab. There are certain spots that cab are only allowed to drop off and not pick up. You would then have to walk across the street to the other side in order to grab a cab (weird rule!)   I've only traveled to Ogilvie twice, this past Saturday and today, and it made my trip so easy!  I knew that if I were to stop at the Union it would take me longer.  Before you start laughing, I'm a girl that comes from a place where we drove everywhere and the use of trains were rarely used.
