My husband and I thought it would be a great Father's Day gift to set sail on Lake Michigan.  Captain Tom and his wife Kristi exceeded our expectations and provided a fantastic experience we'll remember forever.  They aren't too hands on and are there when you need them.  They are super flexible and have maintained their boat impeccably.  This is a great way to see the city from a different view and I'd recommend Salty Dog Sailing without hesitation.  I'm looking forward to future sails!
