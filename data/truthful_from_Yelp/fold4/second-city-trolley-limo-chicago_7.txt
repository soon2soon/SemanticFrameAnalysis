I booked this trolley for my friend's bachelorette party. It was a wonderful experience! Our driver, Tom, was extremely helpful. He called us before the event to confirm all of our details. He helped us load the trolley with our ice and drinks. He also took us to a few really scenic areas in Chicago, so we could take photos with the bride. At every stop, he helped the ladies get on and off the trolley safely. The trolley itself was very clean and spacious. We rented the 25-passenger trolley. It had an awesome open balcony-like area in the back. We had more than enough space to walk around and dance while Tom drove us through the city. It was amazing to be able to party with the city as our backdrop. The bride-to-be and guests had a wonderful time. I hope I have an opportunity to use their services again!
