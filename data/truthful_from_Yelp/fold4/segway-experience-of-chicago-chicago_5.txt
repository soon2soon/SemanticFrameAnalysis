Great experience.  We recently took the museum campus tour and had a great time.  Our tour guides definitely took the time to make sure each person was comfortable on the Segway.  We had a large group (maybe 10-12 people) so we tended to spread out a little bit and had to wait, but it was fun none the less.   A note of caution... remember while riding the segway you have a strong breeze blowing on you so it can be a bit chilly compared to the surrounding temperature.
