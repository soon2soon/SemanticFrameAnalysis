Three of us went on the architectural tour.  My mom was in a wheelchair but can walk with a cane.   They will hold the wheelchair for you while you're on tour and they were helpful to assist my mom on and off the boat.  No steps, just a ramp, and was easy! The tour was tons of fun and we learned some cool facts.  Jake, from State Farm, was our tour guide and he was hilarious and knowledgeable.   At the end, you get a fun little speedboat ride and the crew will walk through and take your groups photo if you'd like.   This was a neat way to see a different view of the city!
