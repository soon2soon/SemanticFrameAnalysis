i love this hotel! The location is near the activities of Rush Street yet situated in a lovely brownstone neighborhood. What I genuinely loved about the hotel was the staff. I would have my coffee in the lobby prepared by barista Kristen. She knows her coffee and she knows the history of the hotel. Kristen is passionate about working at Public Chicago.  David, Dir. of Operations,  gave us an impromptu art tour of the art in the lobby. I felt that everyone of the staff welcomed us as a guest to their home.  Loved it!!
