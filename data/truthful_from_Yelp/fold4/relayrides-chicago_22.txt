I rented from relay rides for the first time this past week.  The cost was half as much as we would pay from a rental company and we were able to select from several options for the size vehicle we needed and our budget requirements.  We got an amazing, accommodating owner and an older, but well maintained Lexus.  Relay rides will be my first choice from now on when I need to rent a car and every time someone tells me they are traveling, I tell them about relay rides.  It is an awesome service!
