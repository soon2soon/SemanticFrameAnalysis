I saw an ad in the Tribune for a Canine Cruise on the Mercury Skyline and given how spoiled my mini poodle is, I couldn't pass this up.  The tour lasted 90 minutes and cruised around and Lake Michigan.  The cost was $22; $10 for kids 4-12; $7 for dogs.  The narrator provides dog biscuits throughout the tour, which all the dogs seemed to enjoy.  The Canine Cruise is only on Sundays at 10am during the summer months (July - September).   The tour was both informative and fun for humans and doggies.  It was so cute to see all sorts of dogs on board, big ones and small ones.  My dog loved the summer breeze and she had so much to look at.  My pup loved the boat tour!  I've also been on the Chicago Architecture Foundation's First Lady and I believe the two cruiselines are connected.  The First Lady is definitely more informative when it comes to learning about Chicago's architecture.  But this cruiseline was definitely entertaining.  There are tons of great photo opportunities, especially when on Lake Michigan.  I would highly recommend the Canine Cruise to all dog lovers.
