Best service at a reasonable price! I used them for my boyfriends birthday and we could not be any happier! I had heard about Loyalty Limo from a friend that had used them for a bachelor party. He had nothing but good things to say about them so I gave it a try. Have you ever been in that situation that you order a limo and you never hear from the company and when the time approaches for the Limo to come your heart is pounding and you are anxiously waiting and praying that the limo actually comes? Well that is NOT the case with this company! They verified the address and time of pick up a couple of days ahead of time and made sure I had a contact number so if anything happened I could let them know. They made our night amazing and stress free! When the Limo dropped us off at a Lounge in downtown we had asked to be picked up again at 2:30 am. Well one our friends had a little too much to drink and I called the driver and asked if he could pick us up at 2:00 am instead so that we could get our friend back home. The driver was so nice about it and he asked if I wanted him to come back right then and there. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT IF YOU GO WITH THESE GUYS! I am not the type of person to write a review unless something absolutely blows my mind or I am completely dissatisfied with. This company blew my mind with such AMAZING customer service!
