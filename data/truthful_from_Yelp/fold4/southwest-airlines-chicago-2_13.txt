Awesome airline! Flies out of Midway in Chicago which is not the most convenient airport to get to for us but the airport is a lot smaller and easier to navigate than O'Hare so we don't mind traveling from Midway. The plane was clean and the regular economy seats were quite spacious! The flight attendants were not only friendly and helpful but they were hilarious!! "...and to those of you traveling with children, what were you thinking?!" Love the outgoing personalities I encountered while flying SW. They make me want to be a part time flight attendant. They just seem to have fun with their, I'm certain, highly stressful position. Ie. crabby travelers, high maintenance fliers, and screaming kids! Wait, maybe I don't want that job... I will definitely travel Southwest again. Not only are they a more reasonable airfare, they are also cleaner and more enjoyable than most other airlines. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights!
