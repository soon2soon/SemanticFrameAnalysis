I just rented a car in Phoenix for a training I attended. I plan on using this service every time! Â No more Budget, Enterprise, or Hertz. Relayrides is the way to go! Pros: cheaper rates, ease of use, picked up at the airport, meet real people, Cons: Didnt have a GPS, but my phone did so no worries.
