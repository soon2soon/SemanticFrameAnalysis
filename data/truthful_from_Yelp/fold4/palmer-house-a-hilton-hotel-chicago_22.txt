I've stayed in a lot of nice hotels but this place really sticks out because of it's character and a ceiling that is so beautiful to look at that you'll leave with a neck cramp if you've never seen it before. From the moment you walk in the doors, the Palmer House proves itself to be a class act. You also get the sense that a lot of conversations that changed the course of politics in the city of Chicago have taken place in the lobby bar underneath that ornate ceiling. You'll get the typical high end Hilton amenities while staying here. The rooms are typically large, but the hotel is almost 90 years old and you probably won't be spending much time lounging when the location of the Palmer House lends itself to exploring the downtown area by foot or hopping on the L. Do yourself a favor and stay here, especially if you've already seen the Drake, which I believe to be inferior to this property. I can't wait to get back!
