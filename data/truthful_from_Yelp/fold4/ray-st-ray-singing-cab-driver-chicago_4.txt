I'd heard urban legends about this guy, but in a city this large, what was the likelihood of me encountering the only singing cabbie? It was raining, I was tired, and my aching feet would not survive another semi-hike to the Blue Line. So I flag down the first cab I see. I get in and the first thing he says is "can I sing you a song?" Holy smokes, apparently the likelihood was better than I thought. He provided me two songs, witty banter, and the most enjoyable cab ride I've ever had in life. I love living in this city.
