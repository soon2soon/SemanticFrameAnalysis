Fantastic Marriott property in downtown Chicago. It's on South Michigan a few blocks from Millennium Park - an easy 10 minute walk. The building is old (completed in 1910) but it's completely renovated in the style of the day. It was once considered the finest luxury hotel in Chicago and in 1998 it was designated a historic landmark. As for the hotel today, the rooms are big enough and well appointed (there's a television in the mirror). The bed is great and the shower glass and stone. Rich dark wood and brass is everywhere. The black and white contemporary photography is a nice offset and its especially well executed. Usually this format has overblown contrasts and poor composition - not so here. The staff was very accommodating. My only complaint - and it's the same one I have with most US Marriott top properties - is that the Concierge Lounge is completely inadequate. It's much too small, not enough seating, early close (yes, locking the door at 10PM is a too early close), etc. This doesn't make sense for a property as nice as this one. One of the coolest things I've see in any hotel ever can be found here - the elevators each have a big brass clock-like dial like a clock that tells you where the lift is as it moves from floor to floor! So cool. I can only imagine what it must have been like to walk out of the big brass revolving doors in 1920 and stroll down the avenue or along the lake.
