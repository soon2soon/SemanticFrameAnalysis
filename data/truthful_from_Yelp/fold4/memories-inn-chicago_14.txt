This place has new owners. Its actually called Sunset Pho Caffe now and lemme tell ya, this place rocks!!! Very clean, the staff is friendly (beautiful bartender), the food is great!!! I had the combination fried rice and it was amazing! The chef even spiced it up a little more for me! I highly recommend this place for food and drinks. I give this establishment 5 stars out of 5!
