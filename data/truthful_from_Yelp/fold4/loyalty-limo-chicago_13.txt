I recently used Loyalty Limo for my wedding on Oct 12.  After calling around a couple places, I decided that Loyalty had the best package, and Vince was the most responsive.  He put me at ease that things would go the way I wanted. Day of the wedding, I received an email first thing in the morning to confirm when and where the limo would make the first stop to pick up my bride to be.  Limo was on time and clean. After the service we wanted to drive around a little and take some pictures.  Our driver was very friendly, and even had a few suggestions of his own.  He dropped us off at Wrigley Field and knew he couldn't park there, so he gave me his cell number and drove around the corner to park.  When we were ready, I gave him a call and he was back right away to pick us up for the next stop. Second stop we ran into some problems because it started to rain.  So we decided we wanted to drop our photographers off at our hotel, and since we still had some time left, I asked if we could just cruise down Lake Shore for a while.  No problem.   Inside the limo was clean, well stocked with clean glasswear, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Our driver was friendly, professional and helpful.  If I'm in need of a limo again, Loyalty will be my first call.
