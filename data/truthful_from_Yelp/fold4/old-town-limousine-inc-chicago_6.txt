Coming to Chicago, you can imagine how many car services there are to choose from. I relied on Yelp and couldn't be more pleased. Belal and his crew are professional, timely and courteous. Â And the cars are clean and comfortable. On our second leg back to the airport my business meeting ended far earlier than it was supposed to and when I reached out to Balel he informed me that our driver was waiting outside the door of our hotel! :-) The good reviews for this service do not fall short of their promise. When in Chicago again, I will definitely use Old Town Limousine!
