The crew on The Spirit of Chicago make the best out of a less than ideal situation... We booked a lunch cruise for the Air and Water Show on 8/17/14 but because of bad weather / clouds, the show was canceled.  The Spirit of Chicago opened the bar to all passengers even if the passengers hadn't purchased the bar package enhancement.  The Air and Water Show cancelation was COMPLETELY out of their control but they made every effort to 'comp ' the passengers.  Even de-boarding was an 'event' as the crew line up at the bottom of the ramp and and you for cruising with them (extra points for de-boarding cookies) I'm not sure what the other reviewers ate, but our food was very good.  The cavatappi, yum and the short ribs were moist and delicious.  And don't get me started on the desserts... A huge variety and each one we tasted was great.   The boat is clean, the crew is friendly, the DJs on our cruise were interactive.  We are thinking about having our parents' 50th wedding anniversary here, now, because of the positive experience we had.
