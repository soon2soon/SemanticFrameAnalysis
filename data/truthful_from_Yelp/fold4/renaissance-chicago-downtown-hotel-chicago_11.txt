We just had our wedding here 1 week ago. Wonderful experience for us, our family and our guests. Our wedding went perfectly. Guests that came to the wedding and stayed there had a great time. Those that stayed repeatedly told us how accommodating the hotel was to them. We absolutely love the hotel bar and the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The food at the hotel and during our reception was great. Would recommend to anyone needing to stay downtown and also anyone looking for a great venue for their wedding. Ask to work with Megan Goehler, she is amazing! Cocktail hour on the terrace is unforgettable!
