I got a reservation here last Sunday night.  Wasn't expecting much for $130 in the middle of Chicago, but I was blown away.  This place is super nice for the price.  Great lobby, service, location, and the room was one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in.  All nicely furnished, and a large bathroom with walk-in shower.  In the morning my friend and I went up to the top deck to check out the views.  How cool is the deck?  I could have hung out there all day. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll be looking to stay here! p.s. - I read some other reviews on Tripadvisor about the elevator being slow, don't believe it.  It's not slow at all, and if that's the only thing to complain about consider it a good thing.
