This hotel is one of my favorites in the area. The staff is friendly and always makes our stay as comfortable as possible. The rates are reasonable for the location, which is the heart of Chicago's downtown Streeterville area. We stay here every time we come home to chicago. We are even getting married here in May. The Director of Catering, Victor has been very helpful and attentive through the planning process. The Crystal Ballroom is very elegant, which is what I have always dreamed of for this special day. The hotel has a 1930's feel to it, which also makes for a unique experience. The rooms have been renovated, but I like the fact that the lobby and ballroom still has that old chicago feel to it. I hope all of our guests enjoy the knickerbocker as much as we do.
