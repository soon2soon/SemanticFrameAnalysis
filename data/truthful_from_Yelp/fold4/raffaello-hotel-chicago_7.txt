My girlfriend and I stayed at the Raffaello for three nights in late August, and we could not have asked for a better experience. Being in our early twenties, we are more than used to condescending and presumptuous service and hospitality situations, but we received nothing of the sort over the course of our stay. Upon arriving we were upgraded to a suite by Alicia who, along with the bellhops (whose names escape me) were nothing but kind, helpful, and enthusiastic. The room itself was great- spotless, spacious, and had one of the most comfortable beds either of us had ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. I can't speak to the restaurant, but we did stop by the bar upstairs for a cocktail before dinner. It's a bit clubby/loungy, but nothing too over the top. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, which were crafted perfectly. It's definitely a mixology bar and if you're into that stuff (like we are,) you'll enjoy your time. Our stay here was perfect. We could not have asked for anything more from the staff who went above and beyond to ensure we were attended to. We've found our hotel.
