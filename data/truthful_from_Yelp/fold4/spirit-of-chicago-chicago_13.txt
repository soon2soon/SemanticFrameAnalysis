Of all the boat cruises that I've been on, I enjoyed the Spirit of Chicago the most.  THe food was much better than expected (compared to other cruises) and the views were amazing - especially during the summer when Navy Pier does fireworks every Wednesday & Saturday nights at 9pm.  Also, if you get an Entertainment book - they have a buy one cruise, get one free special!
