I love flying Southwest!  I've never had a bad experience with them, and I fly quite frequently.  On the rare occasion I check bags (1-2x a year if that), 2 bags fly free and I've never had a lost bag with them.  Price wise, I've been able to find cheap flights with Southwest.  I've also been able to change flights for one that is cheaper should flight prices change after you book your flight and the difference can be used on future flights.  They also have sales throughout the year (I purchased tickets to San Antonio for 40% off with their last sale). In terms of check in, you can begin checking in 24 hrs before the flight departs.  You're lined up in the order you check in (A 1-60, B 1-60 and C1-30) and once you board, you choose whichever seat you'd like.  They're beginning to incorporate wi-fi on flights.  I've had a few delayed flights, but most have been weather related.  The last one was from BWI to CMH due to storms and tornado watches in Baltimore, but anyone who ordered alcohol on the flight got the drink for free.  Southwest takes care of their flyers, does community service and helps those in need, so they sit well with me!
