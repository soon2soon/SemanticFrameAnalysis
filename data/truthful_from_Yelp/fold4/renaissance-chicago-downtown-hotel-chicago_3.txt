I Love Renaissance Chicago!!! Every time I plan to visit the beautiful windy city, this hotel pops up! in my mind! automatically!:)   Our stay #1 was amazing, so! it was followed by stay #2 & then #3.   The front desk staff members in this hotel are some of the most helpful people in the planet.  We have encountered a few unexpected problems with arrivals & schedule changes due to some unavoidable travel circumstances & they were always there listening, helping us work things out.  Yay! we still got a room! I miss being there! in the 'happy rooms' (that's how I call it) with a view. I love the vibe of the city river & the bright lights of the Chicago Theatre right by the window. It's exhilarating. The lobby decors are always cool & trendy.   The breakfast foods, YUM!
