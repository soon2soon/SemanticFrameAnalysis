From entering to exiting everyone we dealt with was professional and helpful. T,he best in service. Jeff at reception was nothing short of amazing and can't forget to attentiveness of Joseph, food and beverage manager. The suite we had was very clean and super comfortable. After all the walking around the city, we felt at home when we came back. Le Bar was very relaxing (by the fireplace) and the bartender was awesome. Cafe de architectes was a delight. the staff was what a restaurant staff should be.
