I love this stop! I lost my husband here, (haha) and the security guards were extremely helpful! (What? I'm the crazy Californian who isnt attached to a cell:) Clean station, friendly staff. Its a hard choice, as another reviewer mentioned- between here and Union. Ticket lines can be a hassle, however, its 3 dollars extra to buy your ticket on the train...so stand in that line, folks. Lots of places to eat, get a drink and use a payphone if your cell battery dies like mine did (its funny NOW;) Good luck, and safe travels!
