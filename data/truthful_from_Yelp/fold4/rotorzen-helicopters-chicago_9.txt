Well done guys.   Had to schedule with 5 days notice, over the holidays, scheduled without a hitch. Imagine my surprise with how simple this was, drive up, show the voucher to the guard, and into the terminal we went.  Met Ryan, and then the Pilot, John.  Very friendly, helpful, personable and knowledgeable fellows.  John was an absolute pleasure in the air, even reminded me of the Docents of the Chicago Historical Society's boat tours. The ride was comfortable, and over way too soon. Will go again, and am telling all my friends...
