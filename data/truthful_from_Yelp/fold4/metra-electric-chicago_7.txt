Parked at the Dunes and took the hour long ride to Millenium Station. Very comfortable, announcements were loud and clear, conductor came by frequently to collect tickets/cash. $7.50 one way for one person - not bad for a relaxing ride and no driving/parking headaches - try to drive and park in less than an hour!!!
