Loved this hotel!  Great location, clean, spacious, and great view from our high floor, huge window!  Wonderful, comfortable bed and best dining experience we have ever had at a Residence Inn!  We had dinner on wed night which had a nice salad bar, pork, cheesecake, and free beer and wine...perfect after traveling.  Service at the free breakfast buffet was fantastic. ISMETA kept everything running perfectly...no long lines and she made sure that ALL buffet items and coffee were available at ALL times.  She even made waffles for guests and delivered them to their tables!  We have stayed at other Residence Inns and although we appreciate the free breakfast buffet, none were run as well as this one.  We think ISMETA would be great at training Marriott employees at other locations!   We would  highly recommend this hotel...so convenient and economical to not have to search out and pay for breakfast each morning.  We enjoyed the extra space a Residence Inn provides (couch, chair, table, desk) and love having the kitchen with a full size fridge, microwave, stove top, dishes/pots & pans, and dishwasher.  If we return to Chicago, we would definitely stay here again.  Thank you ISMETA for making us feel very welcome and making our stay so enjoyable.
