We were very fortunate to spend a morning with Captain Tom and his wife Kristi. My friends and I got together a bought a 6 groupons for this incredible experience. Captain Tom and Kristi were gracious hosts and their boat is a beauty! Kristi took plenty of pictures for us and took part in our conversations - regardless of how silly they got. For 2.5 hours we sailed out into Lake Michigan and enjoyed a champagne/minosa brunch. This was definitely a luxurious way to spend a Sunday morning. The weather was perfect and the views of the city from the lake were breathtaking! We definitely lucked out on cost b/c of the groupon deal, but I'm pretty sure my friends and I decided it would be worth it to go again - groupon or not.
