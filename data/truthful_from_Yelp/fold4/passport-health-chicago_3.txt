It has been a long time since I needed to visit a travel clinic of any sort, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was greeted by a very warm receptionist and settled into the waiting room, dreading a long wait.  However, as punctual as can be, I was seen by one of the specialists who took me into her office and passed me a detailed and specific booklet (probably 20 pages) of every recommended immunization and precaution needed for my specific trip. She walked me through each risk one by one and answered my questions thoroughly. She told me the upsides and down sides to different types of malaria medications and typhoid shots/pills.  She gave me recommendations for updating some of my older shots as well.  After a thorough explanation, she asked me which of the immunizations I wanted and which I would pass up. She helped me to make the best decisions based on my personal preferences, risks, and needs. I ended up deciding to get three shots (Tetanus booster, Typhoid, and also a Polio booster I should have gotten a long time ago). She also prescribed me malaria meds and an antibiotic. I did not  feel pressured or like she was trying to up-sell (I was worried about this going to a specialized travel place). I spent a significant amount of money, but it seemed comparable to anywhere else.  Additionally, after spending the money, I did not feel regret, like I made the wrong decision. In all, my visit was less than an hour, and that is with me asking a lot of questions. They were never impatient and never seemed to rush. They gave me the attention a client deserves, and treated me better than I could have ever expected. They were also knowledgeable. I asked some questions, thinking she would get caught up, but the nurse knew her stuff! I would highly recommend the Chicago location.
