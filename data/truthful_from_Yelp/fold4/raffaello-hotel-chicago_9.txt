Spent the night last night.  Got a great rate on Expedia and had stayed here one other time.  But since our last stay they added an 18th floor bar w/outside patio(unfortunately raining so we couldn't enjoy) and a coffee/doughnut shop w/in the lobby. Bartender had fun stories of the area and the past of Raffaello(supposedly it was a hospital long ago).  Rooms are very nice size w/king size bed.  In room snacks were available and not outrageously priced.   We received texts upon our arrival asking if we needed anything to let them know.  Also received one in am at checkout asking if we needed help with our luggage.  Nice touch!  Location is w/in walking distance to great restaurants, the lake and shopping
