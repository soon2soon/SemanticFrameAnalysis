Mike was our tour guide and he was AWESOME!!! I highly recommend the tour but even more highly recommend him!! The Donut Vault was soooo sooo sooo soo good!! Lou Malnami's (sp) was great. Xoco wqs so good we went back to Frontera Grill for dinner. Al's beef was yummy and fab cakes was fabulous too!!! We purchased the Grouon for the tour but it was well worth the full price. I would love to rent Mike our out for a full city tour!!!
