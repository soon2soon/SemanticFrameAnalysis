Through price line negotiator, I was able to book this great hotel for a  3 night stay. Zero hassle and the staff was more than courteous. After checking out, I received an email from Simeon, stating that a bag was found in the lobby area. Although there was no name to be found, Simeon was able to match the last 4 of my credit card number with the last four that was on the receipt in the bag.  I was so grateful the items were returned and was so very appreciative of Simeon for going above and beyond to return my bag of souvenirs. The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and Humberto at the bar was also very helpful with recommendations on what to do while in Chicago! I would definitely recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anyone looking for an affordable & classy hotel.  Thank you Simeon!
