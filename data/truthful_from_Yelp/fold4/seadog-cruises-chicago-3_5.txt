I love the architecture & lake tour!  I've been twice and had the same guide, Brian, who every time teaches me something new about the city.  You can tell that he has a passion for what he does and he makes everyone feel welcome and wanting to have a good time.   You would think your typical architecture tour would be boring, but no way.  Brian tells you interesting facts about the buildings you really care about and lets you know when there's going to be a good photo opportunity.  Some of his jokes were hilarious, example:  "is anyone here on a match.com date? we want to make sure you guys are having a good time."  hahaha.   I went with my parents and we had a blast.   Not only do you go through the river but you're also going on Lake Michigan for a bit  (I wish this bit was longer!).  I definitely want to try the extreme thrill ride- that's next!
