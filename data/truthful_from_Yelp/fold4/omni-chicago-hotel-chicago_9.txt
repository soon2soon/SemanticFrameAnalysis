Great hotel.  Great locations. Great service. Good beds. Good prices and a good size of rooms - especially for downtown Chicago.  I will definitely stay here again when I visit Chicago.   I'm not sure if you could ask for a better hotel.  If there was one thing I would ask that they improve it would be the speed of their internet and not charge for it.  I just think good internet speeds (at least 5mb or higher) for free is the way to go.  Charging for internet is like Frontier charging for carry-on luggage in my opinion. Overall-great hotel!
