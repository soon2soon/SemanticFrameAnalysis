I just rented second city trolley for a barcrawl for my birthday and it was great! I had the smallest group of 25 and actually upgraded a day before to the 30. Of course, some people called sick the day of and I wanted to downgrade back to a 25 person trolley. They said it was too late in the day but since they never mentioned a specific time and rather said "you can call the day of and see" - they honored their word and gave me a discounted price. They have great customer service but it is hard to get someone on the phone on the weekend. Our driver was great and was very prompt on timing picking us up from each location. They provide coolers and garbage bags and the seats are on the perimeters of the trolley rather than all facing forward (huge plus!). Get all the details before upgrading if you're not sure but I would say, our experience was as good as it gets. I would recommend them for any friend renting a trolley in Chicago!
