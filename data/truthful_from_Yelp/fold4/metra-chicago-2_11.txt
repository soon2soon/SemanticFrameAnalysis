I just started taking the Metra to work (UP Northwest Line) and it is amazing. Sure, the trains aren't perfect and they aren't always on time, but this beats sitting in the logjam of traffic like I used to by a mile. The overall commute takes a little longer by the time I walk to the station, ride the train, and take the bus to my work out in Rolling Meadows, but it is so much more enjoyable now that I can spend the time reading, sleeping, listening to music, etc. Thumbs way up!
