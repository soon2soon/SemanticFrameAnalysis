Though you wouldn't be able to tell upon entering the lobby, their rooms are very contemporary and modern. Their beds are super comfortable. Their service is impeccable. I came here for a conference, and was able to get a room here for only about $100 per night after all taxes and fees, along with WIFI. Inside the room, there's a 32 inch LCD TV mounted above a desk. As for other amenities, there's a small fridge, which is perfect if you are looking to save a bit of money by buying a little convenient food from grocery stores instead of dining out every night. Chicago restaurants are pretty pricey. There's a Trader Joe's within about a 7 minute walk. There are multiple Walgreens nearby as well. Almost directly in front of the hotel, there's a bus stop if you decide to take the metro. And if you are in a pinch, the hotel staff is very fast as calling a cab for you. If you decide to take a stroll, the Magnificent Mile district is only about a 15 minute walk north. The housekeeping provides plenty of condiments like coffee, cream, and sugar. Oh, and of course they provide a fluffy robe as well. Their AVEDA toiletries are very soothing, clean, and have a very pleasant but faint scent that is gender-neutral. Lastly, the walls are pretty thick, and the area is very quiet as well in general, particularly for downtown. Also, once you roll down the blinds, the room stays dark even during the middle of the day. So if you stay out late, you can definitely sleep in late. Check out the attached pictures for some additional shots. Often, the professional pictures hosted on hotel websites do not necessarily represent what the rooms actually look like.
