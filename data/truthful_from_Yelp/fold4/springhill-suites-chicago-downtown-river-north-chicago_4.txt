I've stayed at both the Spring Hill and Residence Inn it is connected with. Both have been great choices. Clean rooms, very friendly staff from the front desk to the guys out front. Free breakfast in the morning. Great location with a lot of solid restaurant options within a couple blocks. Highly recommend.
