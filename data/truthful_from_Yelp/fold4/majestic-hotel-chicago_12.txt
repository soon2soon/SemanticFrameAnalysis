In a word...wonderful.  Our kids live in Lakeview and we have tried several places and this one is perfect.  Our room was fresh, and the continental breakfast is served in the beautiful fireplace room was a nice touch.  We met two staff members, Mona and Dan; very helpful.  Made sure that our stay was lovely.  Skip the hassle of the city.  We'll be back!
