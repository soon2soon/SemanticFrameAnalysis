This was our first trip to Chicago together and the Park Hyatt was the main reason we had such a great time.   We arrived after a short cab ride from O Hare and were immediately greeted by the BEST doorman we've ever encountered. He was funny, always smiling for our entire three day stay, and  even gave a cab driver an alternate location for a breakfast spot we wanted to visit that was closer and therefore costs us less in cab fare! He made us feel like celebrities every day and even called us his VIP'S. LOL Wish I could remember his name, he deserves to be mentioned.   One of the highlights would certainly be visiting the NoMi lounge on the 7th floor.  Great stiff drinks, wonderful ambiance and views of Lake Erie, and a terrace overlooking the city. If you go, hopefully you will run into Andrew. He is one of the nicest, most knowledgeable bartenders we've ever encountered. Truly an asset to the Park Hyatt! Make sure to order the Part N Parcel drink. Yummy The shopping nearby is otherworldly. Everything at your fingertips for every budget. Want a scarf at Nordstrom Rack? Done. Or how about a $1.5 million Bugatti from Gold Coast? LOL. We stuck with Nordstrom Rack and some goodies for her from Saks and Neiman Marcus. She loves her "Lolo's".  Seriously, the best shopping outside of Vegas we have ever seen.
