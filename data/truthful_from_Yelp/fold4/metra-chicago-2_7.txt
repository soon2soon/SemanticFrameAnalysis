I used to ride the Metra every day from Berwyn to downtown Chicago. Boy, those were the days. I'd be downtown and at my desk in less than an hour. I no longer need to do that commute, but I wanted to do a shout out because Metra is truly what mass transit is all about. Comfy, fast, efficient and affordable. What else could a transit rider need?
