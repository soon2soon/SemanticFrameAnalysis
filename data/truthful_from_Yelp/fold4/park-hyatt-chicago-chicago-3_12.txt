Great property. Great customer service. This place was home away from home for a few days, and I really enjoyed the view. Everyone there were so sweet even with the chilly weather! The gym was a decent size, 24 hrs!!! I didn't like the elliptical machine though, not used to those. The complimentary coffee, hot water for tea, and hot apple cider was so nice for the weather. The location is so convenient. Smack in the middle of everything!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't mind going back!!! Thank you!!!
