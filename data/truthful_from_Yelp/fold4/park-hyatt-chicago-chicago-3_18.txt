My favorite hyatt in downtown Chicago. Location is a little confusing because the entrance is on Chicago ave, not michigan as the address says so be careful when you call an Uber, you'll have a hard time meeting up unless you give them 110 Chicago. Gorgeous bathtub in the room with bath salts, toothbrush, toothpaste and great soaps and lotion. Lobby has free water bottles (yay!!) and free coffee and snacks in the morning. Haven't checked out nomi yet but can't wait to do so. Housekeeping comes twice a day which can be a little annoying if you're napping after work, but they are gracious and understanding when you grumble a "no thanks" when they come. Overall, a luxury hotel I can't wait to return to.
