My boyfriend and I stayed here for our weekend getaway. This hotel was beautiful, our room was immaculately clean and we had a beautiful river view.  What I really liked is that we were centrally located to restaurants and shops.  The hotel bar was reasonably priced as well.  The staff was very courtious and helpful.  We will definitely stay here the next time we are in the area.
