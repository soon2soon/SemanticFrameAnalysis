The boat tour is actually one of the most informative things I have done since I have been here in Chicago. On top of that, the tour guides are hilarious. Throughout the entire tour our tour guide had a random accent and the moment he talked to us normally it was gone. You get a good ride through the loop and some nice information regarding the history of Chicago as well as some of the more popular buildings that you see. Oh...and they didn't mind that I was shirtless which is a plus.
