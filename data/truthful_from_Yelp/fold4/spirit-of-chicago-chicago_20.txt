We had my daughter's wedding on the Spirit 10/23. I had done the dinner cruise a couple years prior and just remember it being nice. First I'll get the obvious out of the way. Weather was great, the skyline was magical, we had a full moon, the excitement of Navy Pier, and about 20 min of fireworks in the best possible location. As I'm writing this I'm considering if my judgment is skewed because of the emotional night along with the breathtaking views but actually...No, not at all. The food was fantastic, I couldn't tell I was on a boat, we danced until my feet hurt (and the floor was packed the entire time), the DJ did a great job of mixing it up (we even did a little Latin) and they threw in some Karaoke which I thought was perfect, but seriously... the service was second to none! I just jumped on Restaurants.com and picked up some certificates for the cruise. Won't be able to use them on a Sat. for fireworks but I can't wait to go back.
