Saturday I went on the River North tour with my dad (visiting from out of town) and we had a great time.  It was fun to learn about the City and try out different foods.  I had a hard time finding the meeting spot (probably my fault) but aside from that, the tour was great and I would go again!  In fact, I think I'll take my next out of town guest on the Wicker Park tour!  The tour guide was personable and very knowledgable about Chicago and food.
