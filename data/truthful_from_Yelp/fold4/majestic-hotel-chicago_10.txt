This charming little hotel is on a picturesque residential street blocks from the lake and walking distance to great restaurants. I spent every afternoon sitting in front of the antique fireplace and enjoying a quiet cup of tea and homemade cookies. Â Every morning, I was greeted by Dan, the dapper manager who always asked if there was anything the hotel could provide - the answer was 'no'- it was perfect.
