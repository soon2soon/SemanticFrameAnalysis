This is my new most favorite Chicago hotel ever. For $150 a night, we have a bigger room than the usual for that price, in the best part of downtown Chicago. The interior design of the hotel is super cute. There's a flat screen tv, microwave and fridge, plus the bathroom is huge, with a fancy (also huge) shower head. At the cute bar downstairs the bartender told me that if I want to buy a bottle of wine I can just run across the street to a little corner store. In the past I stayed at the Wyndham. This is way, way better. On the (limited) downside, the elevators are mini. There's not a real bedside table for a clock or enough surfaces for stuff in the bathroom. But, I can deal.
