What a way to experience Chicago in a fun and entertaining way. I love this sea dog boat excursion. I took the fastest one. Not much history on the tour but a fun and exhilarating rude and great way to cool off. The weather was perfect and the speeds these boats reach is amazing. I got some awesome pictures of the Chicago skyline. Buckle your seats for one of the best boat rides ever.
