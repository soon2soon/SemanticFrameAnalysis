I adore this hotel! My friends booked two nights here on Hotwire and got a great deal. Only complaint was coming in with out luggage up the stairs, there was no ramp. Otherwise, we really enjoyed our stay here. Its a beautiful place and conveniently located on Michigan Avenue. It's got a retro feel to it, reminiscent of the Great Gatsby. Stunning detail and architectural aspects complete the look. The room was spacious and modern, despite the historic component of the hotel. Loved the artwork scattered about and the room had at least 4 mirrors which is fantastic. The bathroom was nice and had a cool showerhead. The fitness center was clean and had a variety of machines and weights. I love labels and this place did not disappoint. The fitness room provided headphones, water, towels, and even apples. Wish I could've checked out the art hall and the ballroom. Friendly staff, easy checkout and prompt with storing and retrieving our luggage. Excellent hotel and I highly recommend staying here!
