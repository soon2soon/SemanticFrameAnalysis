I was about 45 minutes into a grueling wait for a cab on New Year's Eve when my hero, in the form of a limo service operator, walked into my Lake Shore building. Ms. Hero: "Anyone going downtown?" Me: (emphatic) "YES!" I jumped into her new + shiny black Lincoln Navigator, along with my big bag of booze. The lovely Eastern European woman introduced herself as Irina, owner of Signature Limousine.  I told her I was headed to a house party in River West but needed to make a stop in the South Loop first to pick up a friend.  No problem, she said.   Now for the best part... she was open to negotiation on the price of my 2-stop ride.  $35 with tip!  And I was prepared to pay much more, considering I was running (unfashionably) late. Comparable to the cost of a taxi, AND we rolled up to the soiree in style. She gave us her card, and said she'd be available 'till 5 am.  I called her shortly before 3 am and she arrived within 15 minutes! On a snowy New Year's Eve no less! Impeccable service-- I will definitely be calling Irina again.  Eastern European love :)
