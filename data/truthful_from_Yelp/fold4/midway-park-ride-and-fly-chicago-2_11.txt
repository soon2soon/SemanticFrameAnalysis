I decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews! I reserved my parking online and paid in advance. When I arrived there was a shuttle ready to leave out shortly after I arrived. I like the fact that the shuttle picks you up wherever you park your car, and you do not have to actually walk to it. Getting to the airport the shuttle goes as quickly as possible (hold on tight). When I came back I was a little worried because my flight was more than an hour delayed. I texted the number as instructed and when I got outside there was a shuttle waiting on me. Although it is a shared shuttle, they do not wait until it fills up. The company has shuttles circling often so there is not too much wait time. I did not have to pay any extra money (as I thought I would) because my flight was late. I will definitely use them again, whenever I park at the airport!
