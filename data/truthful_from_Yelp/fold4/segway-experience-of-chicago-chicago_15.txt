Yes, we were those people you saw riding Segways around Buckingham Fountain and the South Loop, wearing helmets to prevent certain death from the ground and snowsuits to prevent certain frostbite from the cold. You laughed at us but we had the last laugh because Segways are so fun;-) I have Segway-d before in Philly and enjoyed that tour as well. I think Segways are just a great way to see different parts of a city quickly, and fun and knowledgeable guides complete the experience. Our guides were Andrew and Tim. We did the Park Glide tour. I had a Groupon but it would have been worth the full price as well. Our favorite part was the ride around Soldier Field. So cool that you can get up close without having to score tickets to a Bears game. (Okay, yes, you can walk around there any day, but it's much cooler on a Segway.) Anyway, I highly recommend Segway-ing, and this company was great and accommodating. We switched our tour date twice and it was no big deal.
