Just had a fabulous stay at this quaint boutique hotel.  It was super easy to get to, just off Lake Shore Dr.  The gentleman at the front desk was very professional and helpful.  We needed a cab to take us to our restaurant, so he sent the bellboy out ( in the rain) to summon one for us.  Needless to say we tipped him very generously!  When we returned to our luxurious suite after dinner, we had a quiet, and cozy evening in.  Breakfast in the a.m. was a step up from the typical breakfast buffet, served in a room that definitely had the feel of a library reading room.  The fire in the fireplace was a nice, and cozy touch.  This hotel is very quiet and comfortable.  It is easy to get anywhere in the city from it. Hotel staff made sure our needs were met.  The courtesy bar in the room was very well stocked, and the prices are an amazing deal.  $15.00 for a bottle of decent white or red wine in the room is unheard of in this city!  The elevator is a real trip. . .Just large enough for 2 people with their suitcases!  I just brought an overnight bag for our stay, so resorted to taking the stairs.  I definitely recommend this hotel!
