Wow.  I've been going to Devon Street for several years and thought I knew everything about...ok, somewhat.  I joined a friend for the Spice of Life Tour and found that there was much more than I expected.   The group met at a Book/Media store that gives you the option to get an idea of Indian/Pakistan culture.  The tour guide, Ali, gives a brief taste of some food and drinks.  My friend received a Henna Tattoo, which was really cool. The tour goes through a few restaurants to sample various foods. I love Indian food and not afraid to try something new.  However, if you've never had it before it can be rather confusing on to try.  Ali was very helpful on explaining what some of the foods were made of and how they were prepared.  It's an excellent chance to find out what you like, so when you go to any of the restaurant you'll be able to order like you've been eating for a long time. We also visited a temple, which I had walked by many times without realizing what it was.  I've never been inside one.  There are rule to follow!  No shoes and hair must be covered.  Unfortunately, the service had ended before we arrived. Also on the tour, you'll stop in a few clothing stores.  Don't expect to find blue jeans and tennis shoes.  You'll learn about traditional Indian/Pakistani clothing.  One of the women on the tour was fitted in a Sari to demonstrate Indian fashion.  The clothing for men and women is quite interesting. Overall, I learned about odds and ends that I just never crossed my mind.  If you want to learn/experience Devon Street, I would highly encourage you to join the tour.   Thanks Ali!
