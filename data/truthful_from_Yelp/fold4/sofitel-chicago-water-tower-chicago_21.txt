Wonderful place to hold a wedding! My husband and I held our ceremony and reception at the Sofitel in September 2011, and we cannot express how grateful we are to them for making our day so wonderful! Especially Rachel, the catering sales manager and our coordinator at the hotel- nothing would have been possible without her constant support and kindness, as well as ability to work smoothly and quickly to accommodate all of our needs. Everything was perfect, from the lovely decor to the exceptional staff to the copious amounts of food. I got fantastic comments from several friends and family about the sincerity and professionalism of the staff, as well as the very very delicious food. The Sofitel is also a perfect location for all out-of-towners. A block from Michigan Ave, the Hancock Tower, shopping, Gold Coast, tons of restaurants and bars in the area, easy to get to public transportation. The hotel itself is phenomenal- contemporary European decor, lots of open space, fantastic restaurant and bar. The rooms are pretty sizeable and the suites are huge. The bathroom is beautiful, clean and spacious as well (love the Hermes toiletries). Although a bit pricey for the average stay, it is a perfect location to hold a large event (especially wedding) or for a luxurious weekend away in the heart of Chicago.
