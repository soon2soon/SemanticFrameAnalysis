By far, one of the coolest experiences of my life. I didn't get the Groupon and paid full price. Totally worth every penny. The whole process was seamless. From the appointment, to the orientation, to the flight. I highly recommend to everyone. Ryan and John are just awesome and make it just a wonderful experience
