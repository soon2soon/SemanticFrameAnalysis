MySpa is a beautiful and spacious spa inside the Fairmont Hotel and in the loop.  I've been there twice since their opening in February and I've had amazing experiences both times. They have a terrific workout facility with brand new state of the art treadmills (there's a personal tv and ipod dock on every treadmill!!) and ellipticals. Awesome locker rooms with showers, steam room, restrooms, and all the amenities you could possibly need (shower caps, razors, toothbrushes, tampons, EVERYTHING!) Before you go to your treatment room there's a relaxation lounge with tea and water and magazines. Everything in the spa is so pretty and makes you feel fabulous. The first time I went I received a treatment called Nirvana and it was too amazing. There was a scrub applied by my massage therapist, Amanda,(all the body treatments are done by massage therapists because they all incorporate a massage element in them!) and then removed with hot towels. Followed by a massage that was most of the treatment and then wrapped up to let my body soak in the nourishing oil. While I was wrapped I received a scalp and face massage. It was soo wonderful!! The best body treatment I've ever received by far. The next time I went to MySpa I did a big workout with my friend in their fitness facility and was going to have a massage afterwards while my friend Lauren, was having a facial.  My therapist, Nicole, was friendly enough to suggest trying thai massage since I wanted to stretch my muscles out. I had never had thai massage, but it was the perfect end to my workout.  My muscles felt relieved. My friend Lauren said her facial was amazing and I'm looking forward to having one the next time I go. The front desk staff was really terrific showing me how to use the lockers (which are huge!) and where the relaxation lounge was. Overall, on both occasions I had the most amazing spa experiences ever. I've already told others about MySpa and I can't wait to go back soon!!!
