Rock the boat, rock rock the boat... Actually there was no rocking on this boat except if you considered all the hot dancing on the dance floor. I was a bit nervous to be stuck on a boat for 2 and a half hours but I'm so glad I took the bull by the horns and took the opportunity. Â  My friend happened to have her birthday on a day I was invited to take this cruise so we both enjoyed an evening at Navy Pier. The sun was out, the drinks were delicious and the ship was alive. We had perfect service I couldn't say one bad thing about staff aboard, not even the tourist/guest! Our server was energetic and prompt. When we decided to enjoy a smoke on the deck he made sure to make his way up to us and refresh our drinks. The food was great and nice variety of choices, from Cous-cous, tilapia, chicken and pasta. The DJ was sweet and gave shout out to all the special occasion guest and played music from every era. I got the chance to get my salsa on and juke slide, Along with asking my server to join us on the dance floor. The bathrooms are the cleanest I've ever seen on a boat, plane or island. So A+ right there, service another A+, Food A+ really I could go on with handing out A's but you get the point. It's a shame other yelpers did not see this as a great cruise. Spirit is owned by the same company who owns Odyssey and the other boats cruises on the pier so I will definitely try the others.
