Loving renting from national.  The cars are clean, newer and they have a great selection.  Their prices are good for what you are getting.  I've never had an issue or concern (unlike experiences with other rental car companies).  They've actually completely earned my business. I rent only exclusively from them now. :) I had a Jeep Compass this visit. Nice vehicle. I love sitting higher than the "normal" traffic.  Comfortable.  No real blond spots.  Good access to cup holders and USB plugs.   Seemed good in has mileage.  Not overly fancy but it had everything I needed for sure :) Thanks national!! :)
