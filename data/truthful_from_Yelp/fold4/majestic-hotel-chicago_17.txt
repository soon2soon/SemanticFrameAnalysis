My boyfriend and I spent the weekend in Chicago, and our main reason for choosing the Majestic Hotel was the easy walk to Wrigley Field, which was great, however I'd go back whether I was going to a cubs game or not! The honor bar was more than reasonable (which is rare) they have robes, flat screen TVs and quaint decor. The Hotel staff was warm but professional. They offered FREE wifi, and complimentary breakfast. I stayed in Chicago for a convention the following week, and my company put me up in the Hilton Chicago. The Hilton doesn't hold a candle to Majestic!
