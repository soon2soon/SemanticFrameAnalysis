This was my first trip to Chicago and I truly lucked out with the Blackstone! The most beautiful historic hotel I have ever seen. Great historic touches in the common areas and modern touches in the well designed rooms. Friendly and helpful staff...convenient Starbucks and well rated restaurant inside. The location: perfect! On Michigan Ave in a part of town that is mostly college students. 0.5 mile walk to the center of the loop and 0.25 mile to both blue and red rail line stations. The walking is quite pleasant and beautiful. Food Nearby: Umai (amazing Tonkatsu Ramen!), Sofi Restaurant (Romantic Italian Option) and Devil Dawgs (open until 3AM on the weekends). Catching cabs is easy...but the rail is so convenient you shouldn't need them. Pound for pound, I can't imagine there being a better place to stay in all of Chicago!
