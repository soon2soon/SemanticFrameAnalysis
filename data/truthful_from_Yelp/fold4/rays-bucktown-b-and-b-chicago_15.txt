After having bad experiences at other B&B's I have fallen in love with Ray's. Very cool and definately not your mother's b&b! To start with, you aren't required to meet for breakfast at early hours-you get to tell them when you will be ready for breakfast..and the breakfast? WOW. Local culinary students cook up some of the best breakfasts you will ever have, complete with fresh herbs from their garden. We were able to use their laundry facilities, sauna, and they were very helpful with local information. Also, the location is perfect, with just a few short blocks to transit and wonderful resturants and bars. We'll be staying here everytime we go to Chicago. Such a great, unique place.
