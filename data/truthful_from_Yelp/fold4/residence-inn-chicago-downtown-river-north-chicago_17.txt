OK, having basically lived in Chicago in the Renaissance across the river for 6 months on a work assignment, I was pretty spoiled with Chicago hotels.  However, it's different when work isn't paying anymore and you're here on your own!  Being a Marriott girl though, I still gotta support my peeps... enter the Residence Inn/Springhill in River North. What an AWESOME hotel and location in the city for reasonable $$!  It's pretty new, only about 4 years old, I actually remember them working on it while I was here.  There are two matching towers with the same lobby and shared top-level pool/gym area overlooking the city. I stayed on the Residence Inn side, which was really nice.  The service was nothing but friendly.  Great room, on the smaller side but clean and well-organized.  Best thing about this brand of Marriott is the comfort of having a sofa and kichenette area to spread out and get a touch of home.  No tub, only a walk-in shower.  I actually LOVE huge showers, but I know some people may not.  Also can't argue with FREE breakfast and internet, and the location can't be beat!  Walk everywhere downtown or hop on the nearby train line to go to one of the neighborhoods.  If you have to park though, that may suck, as the valet is $50/day.  Leave your car at home if this is your overnight resting place. Will definitely be back for future stays!
