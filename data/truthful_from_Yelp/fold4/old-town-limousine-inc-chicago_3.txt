Belal and his drivers are expert, professional, kind, on-time, helpful and friendly. I've been using his car service for over a year now and I've gotten pretty spoiled by how great he is. He's always on time. He's flexible and easy going when plans change. I agree with everything the other reviewers have said. On a recent business trip I had a conversation with him (I was feeling uncharacteristically chatty, and he obliged) about getting stuck in St Louis during bad weather in Chicago. I told him about renting a car but wishing I didn't have to drive myself. He told me he would have driven down to pick me up! I was surprised to learn he could accommodate long distance drives. I wish I'd known that then but it never occurred to me. It would have saved me some white-knuckle driving and turned a stressful situation into a much more bearable travel experience. I use Belal's car service exclusively now but only for my business needs. I look forward to expanding that at the next opportunity. I'll definitely call him for any personal needs that arise.
