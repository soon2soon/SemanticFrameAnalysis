It's not unusual for a company to talk about "customer service".  Ryan is a company that not only talks about their service, they deliver outstanding customer service from the top managers throughout all levels of the organization. Jay A's review does a good job of listing the level of amenities that the apartments are stocked with upon your arrival.  I can just add that my own personal residence doesn't have both a stand blender and an immersion blender in the kitchen - but the Ryan apartment had both. Check In and Out are very easy and accommodating.  On the few occasions where I had a problem, they were always fixed quickly and efficiently. My only criticism is more a comment on today's technological world than anything else.  The electronics (TV, DVD etc.) are pretty sophisticated and unless you are a 13 year old, it can be difficult to operate the 3 different remotes.   They do provide a "cheat sheet" with your check in package, but it's still a challenge.  If a single unified remote exists, that would be nice. All in all, I would not hesitate to use their services again.  They are a quality organization.
