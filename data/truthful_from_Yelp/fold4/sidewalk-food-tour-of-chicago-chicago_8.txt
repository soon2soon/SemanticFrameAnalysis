Ashley was our tour guide for the River North door tour. She was fun, energetic and very friendly. This was definitely a great way to learn a little bit of history about the city and get a taste of great food in Chicago as well. Ashley not only told us about the places we went on the tour, she was also very good at giving extra recommendations of various places to check out in the city. Would definitely recommend this tour to others!
