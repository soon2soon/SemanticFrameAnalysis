Very nice hotel in a fun neighborhood.  Rooms are very good, a bit on the small side. For this they get 4 stars. Why 5 stars? Fantastic service.  I went looking for a place to grab a very late dinner, and got lost in downtown Chicago.  I called the front desk, and she pulled up a map on her computer and stayed on the phone with me until I found the restaurant I was looking for.  For this they deserve 6 stars.....
