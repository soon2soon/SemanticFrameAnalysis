We booked the Lucky Dog for a sunset sail as a surprise for my mother-in-law. The boat is pristine and Captain Tom and Kristi are fabulous hosts. We happened to choose the perfect evening, with calm waters, a fiery sunset and a brilliant full-moon rising as we made our way back to the harbor. We brought our own camera, but Kristi also snapped some great shots and sent them to us following our sail. This was our first sailboat outing on Lake Michigan, but it will almost certainly not be our last now that we have sailed on the Lucky Dog. Give Tom and Kristi a call the next time you are looking for some fun on the water. You won't be disappointed!
