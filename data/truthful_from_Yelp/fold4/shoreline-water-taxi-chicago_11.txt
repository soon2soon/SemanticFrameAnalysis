Errand to run on the dreaded Navy Pier.  And I only have an hour to do it.  Do I rent a bike?  Walk to the #29 and bus it?   Let's go one step better.  Water taxi!!  This is a perfect alternative for getting to Navy Pier.  No train runs close and the buses are a ways off.  So I step out of my place of employment and hop right on.   The water taxi leaves every 20 minutes from in front of the Shedd Aquarium and Navy Pier (there's two running at once at all times).  I believe the cost for adults is $7.  For Museum Campus employees it's FREE!  (psst!  Joe!)   So when I have a 10 minute errand to run at Navy Pier, this is my own personal taxi.  Cheap, great scenery and the whole ride takes 10-15 minutes depending on how choppy the water is.   Another one of Chicago's gems.
