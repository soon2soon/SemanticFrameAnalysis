The Segway tour we took of the Lakefront was definitely the highlight of our weekend trip to Chicago for our 1-year anniversary. Our guide, Andrew, was so awesome! He was very knowledgable about the city and its history as well as the operation of the vehicle. And he was just a cool guy who was easy to talk to and fun to be around. Luckily, riding a Segway is super easy. It took us about five minutes to get the hang of it and by the end of the tour we were pros. It was a blast and I can't recommend this company enough.
