This is a wonderful hotel in a truly fantastic location along Michigan Avenue near Nike Town, Apple Store, Under Armour store, Saks, Nieman Marcus, Bloomingdales, etc. The room rates are reasonable. Although the rooms are a little outdated, a makeover is underway. The room is huge with a suite with a pull out couch, 2 flat screen TV's. The hotel caters to families as it offers small backpacks with coloring books to the young kids. Valet parking is available. Many restaurants nearby. I highly recommend this hotel for many reasons.
