If there was a hotel heaven then this would be it. The hotel was the nicest I've ever stayed in. I was here for a wedding and only had 2 nights here. The hotel is huge! There are lots to see. I suggest taking an hour just to walk around to see all of the nooks and crannies of this place. Check in was quick and breezy. Door man was always friendly. Rooms were beyond amazing in style. I was lucky to be able to see many suites. Bridal suite is practically an apartment in itself. Gym was nice with sauna and steam room. Location is superb. Many landmarks are within walking distance. We were able to get here from the airport by subway and a 15 minute walk.  The bar inside was a bit pricey but that was expected. The room(s) where the wedding & reception were held was incredible in style. Bed was comfortable and balcony was nice with a view of the park.  Every time I'm in Chicago I plan on staying here. Only thing I would change is that elevators needed key card access. So if you are having someone meet you then you have to go down to the lobby to let them up. Along with the bathroom, in itself is amazing. But, I wish there would have been a vent fan in here for sound & steam.
