Its very very hard for any airline to beat Southwest, in any category: 2 Free Bags checked on every flight Frequent flyer points for travel with no restrictions Free soft drinks and coffee Free snacks Flight crew that actually have a sense of humor! They don't call it the LUV airline for nothing. I LUV this airline, as A-List Preferred member and a Companion Pass holder for all of 2015 Wahoo! It really is as good as it gets.
