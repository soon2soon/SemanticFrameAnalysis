Quick work trip in Chicago and first time at this hotel.  Loved it.  Great location, really can't beat being by subways lines, shopping, the city, quick walk to lake.  Small grocery store around the corner, plenty of stuff near by and great area of the city.  The hotel is beautiful, warm and inviting lobby, comfortable sofas for relaxing and very nice staff.  Rooms are smaller but its the city.  Comfortable beds and nice bathrooms.   Would return in a heartbeat!  My quick trip report at  chiliandtart.tumblr.com
