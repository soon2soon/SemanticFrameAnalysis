Balal and his team are awesome. He is always on time (actually, always early), always gracious, and a genuinely nice fellow - a sight for sore eyes after a long plane ride and the chaos at O'Hare. He is responsive, proactive and very professional. Our company has used a lot of services in the past, but after having Old Town & Balal a few times, we begged our employers to always use them. Our absolute favorite.
