This is one of those rare experiences that actually deserves five stars. Devon Ave can be intimidating, but the tour's value is in making this wonderful Chicago neighborhood accessible and exciting. Mohammad, the tour guide, public school history teacher and company owner, lived on Devon for more than a decade and grew up with the places he visits. His passion and generosity is great and it's obvious he cares more about the community than the money you'll pay. It's more than food too. It's a cultural experience. Although, don't eat before you go. The tour can be a bit long because of the meals so plan accordingly, but no minute is wasted. It's worth a day to discover parts of the "real" Chicago.
