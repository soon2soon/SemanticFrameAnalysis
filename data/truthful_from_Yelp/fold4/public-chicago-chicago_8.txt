Fantastic stay at The Public.....beautifully, restored classic hotel with tremendous attention to detail. Loved everything about this place from the inviting lobby and lounge/library area to the sexy Pump Room to the minimalist yet sleek modern bedrooms with super comfortable beds to the unique clocks throughout the hotel and in the guest rooms. This hotel is full of history and has pictures of celebrities and dignitaries on walls throughout the Pump Room (reminds me of the 'wall of fame' at the Hotel Nacional in Havana). Great staff all around that greeted me with a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe King when I mentioned I was a light sleeper. Convenient walk to the shore, Magnificent Mile, Gold Coast, and Old Town. Includes complimentary access to the uber trendy David Barton gym (though a short cab ride is required). Pump Room at the hotel is hottie central with many good looking people working there as well as people frequenting this popular place. The food is amazing--restaurant is run by Jean-Georges and is drop dead to die for. Best tuna tartare I have ever had; same thing for the charcuterie platter. I have stayed at many chic, boutique, uber trendy hotels that were nice but most were lacking something--not here. Probably the best US hotel I have stayed at in years. I would definitely recommend this place and plan on returning again on my next visit to Chicago.
