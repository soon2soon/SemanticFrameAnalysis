Living in California, we have trains that go all over the place, but they don't really meet up or *join* together which would actually entice one into taking public transportation. That's why everyone in California drives. Someday we'll have our BART extension in early 2025 or so and we'll have bragging rights like Chicago. I was ecstatic when I was able to download the *Embark Metra* app on my phone a do a trip planner to get into Chicago, and I also found an *Embark CTA* app for the *L* also. What is nice about the Metra UPW line that we took, you are able to pay the conductor once you've boarded. Upon our return to suburbia, the departure screens told us which track that our train was on. (You may think this is funny that I am pointing something out as simplistic as a labeled train track, but I dare anyone to go see if they can find their way out of San Jose Diridon by reading the non-existent signs.) Very punctual, not overly crowded, and relatively clean trains. I was a bit surprised that the windows are still tinted green. I thought that was put on there in the 70's so you didn't notice how dirty Chicago was back then!
