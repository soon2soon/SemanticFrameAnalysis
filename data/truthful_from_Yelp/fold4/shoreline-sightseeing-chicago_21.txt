The boat tours in Chicago can sink or swim by how good their tour guides are. We went on one last year that was a snooze fest because of the awful guide. We had Victor this year and he was awesome. Great stories and tons of jokes and just mad the whole thing very entertaining. Shoreline is nice because they leave right off Navy Pier and have massive boats that can fit a few hundred people. And there are tons of tour times so whatever you want usually works.
