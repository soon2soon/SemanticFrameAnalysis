I use the commuter service from Erie Park most mornings and am astonished how few people use this service (approx a dozen per trip which constitutes a busy day).  What could be better than a cool breeze, the open air, lots of space, America's best urban skyline and a leisurely 12 minute cruise down the river.  There is virtually no interaction with the crew so any complaints about service are totally spurious.  Anyone who doesn't think that this is $2 well spent should be thrown overboard!  For those of us who like our space let's keep hoping Shoreline never hire a marketing intern.
