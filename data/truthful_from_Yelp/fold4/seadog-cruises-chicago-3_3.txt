The Seadog Cruise was a ton of fun. We went the first weekend of October. From the moment we got on, I wasn't sure what to expect only b/c it was freezing cold and overcast and we were on a speedboat! Were we going to go all around Lake Michigan in this artic freeze?! The music was so chill and the vibe was energetic and fun. We got started and Grace was the tour guide of the boat. She was fantastically knowledgeable and witty! We enjoyed the tour, loved learning all of the quirks about the city, and got a fantastic recommendation by Grace on where to get deep dish pizza. The locals know! Overall despite the freezing (unexpected) temperatures, it was a great experience and so glad we chose Seadog. I think you can get a coupon in advance through the double decker bus info guide, so if you want to save a few bucks, wait until you get there. We got there about 20 min early so Navy Pier was a great spot to grab a quick bite prior to taking the cruise (and to escape the cold). There's an indoor plaza with multiple food vendors and shops like a famous Chicago style hot dog, fresh greek gyros & pitas, and a mexican choice too to name a few. It can feed all appetites and preferences.
