This was a great hotel. Room was clean and beautiful and spacious. Went on a girls getaway and asked for robes and slippers and when we got back from the theater they had also left us a cute note, bottles of root beer and a small tin of Garretts pop corn. The pool was clean and warm. This location is in the theater district and close to state Street shopping making it a perfect location. Great views also!!
