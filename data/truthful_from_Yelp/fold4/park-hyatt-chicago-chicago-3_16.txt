Was lovely and comfortable. Very good service all 4 nights. Incredible rate even over a holiday weekend. The restaurant Nomi is very good. The location is very central to so much fun stuff. Since we had mentioned it was our anniversary, they gave us free champagne and cheese delivered to the room when we arrived which was very classy. There is free water soda coffee etc in the pantry downstairs in the very comfortable lobby. A few times we just hung out down there on the couch. They also provided a driver for us to go eat one night in a very nice car. We only had to call down when we needed some random thing like more ice, a razor, some batteries, etc and they came right up with it. All in all this was just a very comfortable classy place to stay. The service really sets it apart. We will definitely be back!
