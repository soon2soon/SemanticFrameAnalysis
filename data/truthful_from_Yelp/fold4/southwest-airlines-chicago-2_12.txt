Southwest is the best airline out there. The reward points add up very quickly, there are no bag fees, there are no change fees. Southwest is the only airline that doesn't nickle and dime you. You get where you're going cheaply but comfortably with friendly staff no issues (just accept planes will appear to be a bit late, but that's built into flight times, you always arrive on time). I fly frequently and Southwest is always my airline of choice. The one time recently I didn't fly Southwest (Southwest didn't fly to that location), I got stuck with a $200 change fee, massive security line, and a pain in the ass. Just proved how terrible every other airline is.
