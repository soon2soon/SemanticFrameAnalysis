I booked this hotel based on kid friendly. Let me tell you how super awesome and kid friendly it is! Â We arrived and the kids were greeted first and given a welcome bag complimentary. We booked the Easter package 2 easter baskets were in our room filed with goodies for the kids along Ruth eggs hidden all over the room so we had our personal egg hunt . We left for dinner and when we came back to our room after dinner cookies and milk for the kiddos. Rooms are spacious and have all the necessary amenities. I recommend that you take advantage of becoming a member because of all the perks they offer with specials dinners and promotions. Highly recommended this hotel if you have kids it's in the middle of Michigan Ave off of Huron right by all the action Decent pool and fitness center open late.
