Chicago is a great place to visit.  I have been here many times living in St. Louis and having lived there as a kid.  Visiting downtown is a treat for me.  I have stayed in many hotels over the years. The Blackstone is hands down the best hotel I have experienced.  The architecture of the hotel is beautiful inside and out.  The coziness factor......WOW!!  I love a hotel that can maintain the historic feel but yet have all of the modern amenities.  They have an excellent restaurant, Mercat a la Planca, a nice bar hotel and Starbucks.  The rooms are extremely clean, the beds heavenly.  The bathrooms are awesome, especially the showers.  Get a lakefront room and enjoy the view.  Play pool in the lobby.  The hotel is near the museums and you can walk to the Magnificent Mile.  Close to everything.  I suggest you explore the hotel.  It is a real treat!
