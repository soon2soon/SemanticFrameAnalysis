Not thinking, I grabbed the metra line without enough cash and realized quickly that they don't take credit payment at the Lake Forest station.  I was going to get the weekend pass.  I had a couple of dollars in my pocket when Jeff the attendant asked me what I was purchasing.  When we both realized the predicament, Jeff reduced my fair for 1 way with good faith that I would pay the difference once I reached my destination.  Hard to forget the kind man with a smile on his face and a pink tie to accessorize his work attire who was flexible to my circumstance.  I later gave him a thank you and a handshake.   It's employees like Jeff that make life easier when you're in a bind.   Thanks Jeff.  2:24pm Lake Forest UP-N 2nd or 3rd car on Sunday April 6th, 2014.
