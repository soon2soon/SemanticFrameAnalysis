OPRAH!!!!!!!! I know of this hotel because of Oprah, so yeah I was really excited to stay here. Seriously, who doesn't like Oprah? I trust her taste, so why not stay? This hotel is on the magnificent mile so you will have great access to stores and restaurants. The hotel was great, very nice rooms, great service, awesome location, and has the rich hotel feel to it. I would stay here again when visiting Chicago.
