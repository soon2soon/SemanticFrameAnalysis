I had such a great time at this hotel! Â The place was clean, friendly and helpful staff! I have to say this place was so centrally located and was right there in the middle of the downtown action! There's an Asian fast food place, cafe and Kinko's business center in the area. Moreover clean, clean, clean. I got a great deal on this location via Priceline and will certainly be back to visit next time I choose a place to stay in Chicago!
