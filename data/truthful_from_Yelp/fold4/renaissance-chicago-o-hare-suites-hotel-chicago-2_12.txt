This place really had me not wanting to go out at all in Chicago! I just wanted to stay in my room under those super-comfy cotton sheets! We had a suite with a huge amount of room for our family of four, but it worked well. I didn't like that our bathroom had 2 entrances but other than that, the layout was great. I loved the fact that they had a Starbuck's and the small market where we could buy a candy bar or a small salad. It was expensive, but it's not unheard of for hotels. The staff were helpful (Hello upgrade!) and they were efficient in everything we needed. The rooms were very, very clean and had what seemed like fairly new fixtures and furniture. Â The hotel itself is close to the train and is easily accessible from the freeway. The only downside for me was the restaurant had a total of about 5 items for lunch. (Veggie wrap, burger, salads, panini.) I would have preferred more of a selection.
