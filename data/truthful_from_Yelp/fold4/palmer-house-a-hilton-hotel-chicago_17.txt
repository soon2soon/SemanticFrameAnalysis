I stayed here for three nights due to work.  Wow!  The only drawback was the popularity of it and the crowd to check in and get services in the lobby area.  OK, negative aside, this facility is absolutely gorgeous.  I could walk around looking up all day in the lobby area, enjoying the intricate details only found in designs of yesteryear.  I truly felt like I stepped back in time with all the amenities of the 21st Century.  I wish I would have had more time just to observe and enjoy the Palmer House.  Service was impeccable! Location is perfect for what one might want to do as a tourist.  Walk straight out to State Street for low key affordable shopping at stores like American Apparel, Forever 21, Target.  Or, walk a couple of blocks up to Michigan Avenue for the ritzier stores, Millennium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago (my favorite!), dining (Giordano's Pizza is just a few blocks down Michigan), and incredible people-watching.   Rooms are small, but considering the fact that this hotel is old, old, old, I can settle for small in exchange for the charm and lavish atmosphere.  Linens are great, toiletries are expensive, and the bathroom is pretty.  The shower/water pressure leaves much to be desired, but the water is always hot.  Television is big.  No fridge in my room.   Downstairs is a Starbucks, a place to get a snack, and a couple of hotel restaurants.  I tried the Starbucks for convenience since no coffee is offered in rooms.   I will definitely come back here next time I am in Chicago.
