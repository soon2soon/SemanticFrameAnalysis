Rami is the absolute best! First off, some of the greatest customer service I have ever experienced! I have been open water certified for 12 years and my experience with Rami and Scuba Sensations is one of the best I have experienced for my gear. *I did not dive with Scuba Sensations*. I did take my gear to be serviced after collecting dust for far too long before a big diving trip to the Cayman Islands. I took two regulators and a BC (all of different manufacturers) to Rami two weeks before my trip and he was more than accommodating for drop off AND pick up times. Even with the poor Chicago winter weather, he stayed open late to let me drop off my gear before my trip. When pick up time came, I was having an issue with picking up during regular hours so Rami opened the shop for me to pick up my gear! The prices were reasonable and living in the Northside of the city, it was difficult finding a shop near downtown that would service my gear on shorter notice. This was above and beyond all expectations and I will absolutely be using Scuba Sensations again!
