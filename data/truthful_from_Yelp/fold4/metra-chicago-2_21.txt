The Metra took my mom and us kids downtown to visit my dad at work. And today I take the same line out of the Chicago to my own job. I feel lucky being able to commute to work via the UP North line. Actually, its SO easy commuting to and from work that I have been less gung-ho over finding a new job that may not be public transit friendly. After a refreshing 1/2 mile walk to the stop, the express train gets me there in 18 minutes. Yes I said 18. The ride home is only a half hour and I can read or eavesdrop. I can always find a seat (even if that means sitting on the stairs to the upper level.) Just don't be an asshole and try to take up a whole 2-seat bench. Maybe you can get away with that on the CTA but you better believe someone, such as myself, will be there looming over you to take that extra seat.
