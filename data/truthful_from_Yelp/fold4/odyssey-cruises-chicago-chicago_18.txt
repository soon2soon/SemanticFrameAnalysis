Went on an Odyssey cruise earlier this week with friends and colleagues.  We had a fantastic time.  The weather was perfect and from the moment we arrived at the Odyssey the staff was attentive to our every need.  Cocktails were great.  The wine was tasty and first class.  The wait staff was fantastic.  The food was plentiful and delicious from appetizers through desert.
