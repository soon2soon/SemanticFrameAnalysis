I stayed here on Labor Day weekend in 2012.  I know it was a long time ago but I loved my time in Chicago that I had to write a review. It's very large and spacious.  There's also a nice hotel bar which has a good selection of drinks and eats.  I loved the exercise room, a good size with multiple machines and located downstairs so there's no distractions.  Also free bottles of water for working out, not that cheap water cooler crap that other hotels have.  Awesome! While all that is great, the reason this is for 5 stars is because of the location which is right next to the CTA which takes you anywhere in the city.  I wasn't sure what I was going to do when I arrived but the staff explained how to access the train and what cool places are in the city.  It was easy to access and you can go anywhere you want.  I recommend buying the 3 day pass, I think it was 25$ but it's unlimited access and you can use it as much as you want for 3 whole days.  Add to the fact that the CTA is 24/7 and you'll always have somewhere to go. Bottom line: Chicago is an awesome city and even if you don't stay in the city itself, lodging somewhere like the Renaissance is just as convenient because of the transportation with the CTA and the friendly hotel staff.  This will NOT be my last visit!  I love Chicago!
