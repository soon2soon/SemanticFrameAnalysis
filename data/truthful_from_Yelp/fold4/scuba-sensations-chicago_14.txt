Great place to learn scuba for PADI certification and buy gear! Rami and staff are very flexible and knowledgeable. The gear is competitively priced and there is a diverse collection to choose from. They are always there to guide you at every step of your scuba life. They also have a scuba community going and arrange trips locally as well as national and international scuba getaways.
