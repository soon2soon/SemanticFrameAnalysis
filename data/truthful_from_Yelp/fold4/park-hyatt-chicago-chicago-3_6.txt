Our stay at the Park Hyatt was absolutely amazing! We stayed in a corner room overlooking the lake, the views were amazing. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious. We also got a couple's massage at the spa, highly recommend the massage therapists here. We also loved the aromatherapy that was involved, the pool, and the steam showers. The garden deck has great views and drinks, and the hotel overall has a really good vibe. This was one of the nicest places we have ever stayed and will definitely be back!
