Ive had half a dozen our of town guests stay here at Residence Inn, and I'd recommend it every time!!   THE LOBBY is cozy, lots of inviting couches, fireplace, seats and tables along the huge windows that overlook Dearborn.   THE ROOMS are large and meant for long term stay- with full kitchens.  Rooms are modern yet comfortable, great color schemes, huge windows that look out onto the city, granite counter tops, lovely clean bathrooms, nice fabrics, flatscreen TVs, and overall a very comfortable place to spend an evening, or a week+ if you need. STAFF  The front desk staff has been outstanding every time I've been here.  They also help with concierge type tasks, making reservations for me, calling valet, etc.  And they seem more than happy to help. TIP- For great views, head up to the tippy-top to see the pool & workout room, and the windows up there.  And- free breakfast with your stay, AND free WiFi!  Many hotels in Chicago charge $10-$30/ night for this!
