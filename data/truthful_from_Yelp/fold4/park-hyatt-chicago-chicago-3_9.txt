I always aim to stay at a Hyatt, since I have status, but before the staff knew that, they treated me like royalty. The rooms here are beautiful - marble bathrooms, open spaces and a window seat/day bed. The pillows beds are divine and honestly like sleeping on a cloud. The staff at this Hyatt are some of the best hotel staff I have ever encountered. Joe, the valet manager, knows all the regulars by name and greets everyone with a smile. Kevin and the rest of the front desk staff are always friendly, helpful and knowledgeable - even on the nights I turn up after midnight. The maids do a phenomenal job every day, making sure the rooms are the cleanest in Chicago. I couldn't ask for a better home away from home!
