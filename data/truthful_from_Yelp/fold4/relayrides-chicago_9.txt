I needed a car to get out into the suburbs for just an hour errand. Guys, lemme tell you that the way this worked out was amazing. A friend of mine had told me how great RelayRides was. So when I had a chance to use it for the first time, I was excited to give it a try. (I had already given them my drivers license after my buddy was raving about it, so that's part of the magic here.) I look for the closest car, it's a five minute walk. I ask for it the next morning on the website. 15 minutes later, I get a message RelayRides and the owner of the car, saying I've been approved. I met the guy at the time I committed to on the website, did my errand, and dropped the car back off with a little extra gas. That was it! It was perfect for my day with the car. I'd like to give some constructive criticism, but I can't. I couldn't have had a better experience.
