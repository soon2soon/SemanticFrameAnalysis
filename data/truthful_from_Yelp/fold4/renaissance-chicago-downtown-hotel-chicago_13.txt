Check in was easy. Room was really nice. The concierge was one of the best at almost all the hotel stays in Chicago. She was able to get us last min dinner at Sullivan's steak house. Which was one of the best steaks I've had ever since. She also got us ticket to the game. And recommend some awesome food places. Would stay there again.
