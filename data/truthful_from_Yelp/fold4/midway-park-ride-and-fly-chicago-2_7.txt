I don't usually drive to the airport, but for a quick two-day trip, it made sense. Most of the time, I can bum a ride to the airport from my mom, and then I take a cab home. This year I flew out on Thanksgiving Day and returned Saturday, so when I checked the price of parking for two days, it was just about the same cost as taking a cab home one way. And then my lovely mother wouldn't have to take time out of her busy holiday schedule to shlep me to Midway. It really couldn't be easier. You can reserve and pay online, for either indoor or outdoor parking. The daily rate is a bit more expensive for indoor, but they had no spaces available anyway, so I took the outdoor space option. A shuttle takes you to your terminal, which is less than a five-minute drive away. For two days, it ended up being just under $40, about the cost of what I'd spend on a taxi. It's still more than parking in the remote lot, but not by a ton, plus you don't have to haul your suitcases all over the place. When you return from your trip, you simply send them a text and then a shuttle is waiting outside your terminal to take you back to the lot to retrieve your car. It's completely hassle-free. The drivers (and really, everyone) were so friendly and helpful. They really earn their tips. I highly recommend Midway Park Ride & Fly and will definitely be using them again in the future when the need arises.
