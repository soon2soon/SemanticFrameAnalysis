This very new hotel (which also shares its building with a Springhill Suites hotel--just another Marriott brand), was pretty great. I travel for work, so I've seen my fair share of the insides of hotels, and this one was aces. First of all, there's a very nice and comfortable lobby area with free breakfast and a free "social hour" each evening with wine, beer and munchies. Secondly, the decor is subtle and lovely, not so "hotel-y" if you know what I mean. Third, the room was a good size, especially for a room in downtown Chicago. Even though it wasn't huge, the way it was laid out--with its little kitchen/dining/living area and then the sleeping area--made great use of the space it had. Plus there were floor to ceiling window that made up one whole side of the room, so the light and openness made it seem even larger. Fourth, the bed. VERY comfortable. Fifth: Location. Just north of the river on Dearborn, between Hubbard and Kinze, this place is very well situated. Steps from State Street and Michigan Ave., and very close to the Grand red line CTA stop. Sixth, and probably most important to me in a downtown hotel: it was QUIET!! I know that being on the 16th floor helped with the street noise, but I didn't hear any room-to-room noise either, despite the fact that the hotel was filled with rambunctious Christian teens having their first Big City Experience. The cost for the room--$219/nt. mid-week--is about average for downtown hotels, so I'd recommend this place to anyone--traveling for business or pleasure.
