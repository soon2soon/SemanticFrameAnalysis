Undoubtedly my favorite online share-service since Airbnb I've now been lucky enough to use RelayRides in San Francisco, Austin, and Chicago with exemplary results in each. Â Featuring no lack of cars in all shapes and styles with prices generally a fraction of the major companies I'd be hard pressed to ever rent elsewhere again, the convenience of peer-based pick-up and drop-off far more conducive to a good experience than the dogmatic rules, regulations, and taxes of spots like Hertz, Dollar, or Alamo.
