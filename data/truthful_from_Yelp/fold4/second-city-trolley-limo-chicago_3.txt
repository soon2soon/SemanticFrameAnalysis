I used Second City Trolley for my birthday party over Cinco de Mayo weekend and everyone had a blast. It was an absolute hit and I would recommend this to anyone looking to book something fun for a birthday, bachelor, or bachelorette party. Our driver was Tom and he was super nice! He even helped me load stuff onto the trolley. I can't thank Second City Trolley enough for making my birthday a success!
