For one night, this place was perfect. In town to root for my nephew who is participating in the World Triathalon. Â  Great location Clean, beautiful room- the bathroom wants to make me run home and redesign my bathroom. Beautiful shower and fixtures. Having conditoner for my mop of hair is a big plus right there. Beds were nice and comfortable. Rooms were very clean! Nice lobby area with a billiard table. All of the bellman are really nice and very helpful. We had a very nice guy bring ALL of our bags up to the room for us. All of them are so helpful. Very nice beautiful hotel!
