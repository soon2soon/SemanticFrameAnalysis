Great hotel, great location, EXCELLENT service!!! Rooms are spacious and clean with comfy beds and a fabulous bathroom complete with a soaking tub and separate shower. And the views, at least from our room, are fabulous! Navy Pier, Millennium Park...you name it, you'll see it from the floor to ceiling windows! Plus, free internet? Yep! In a 4 1/2 star hotel, that's practically unheard of. Usually it's $25 a day or more. And since I can't go a day without having to do some sort of work online, this is a definite plus. Check-in was friendly and efficient; the concierge, Andrew, was knowledgeable and super helpful. As were the doormen and everyone else we encountered...with the exception of the bartender downstairs. He was just put-out and miserable but we're not gonna let one bad, sad little apple spoil the bunch; this place was great!
