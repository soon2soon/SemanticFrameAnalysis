I was in the market to purchase a mask and snorkel for a good friend that is moving to Belize. Rami, the owner, was extremly helpful in determining the best combination for someone that is adventurous but has never been diving or snorkeling. He understands that many of us work on a budget and really works with the customer to make a great purchase without battering the credit card. He is knowledgeable about gear and spends unlimited time with each customer to ensure comfort, affordability, and fit. He has a great sense of humor that will keep you rolling and you never feel that you're being ripped off. Of course, you could always shop the internet but it's truly worth it to get the personalized attention and customer service that a great shop offers. I highly recommend Scuba Sensations especially to those who are new to the diving community or just looking for an awesome dive shop.
