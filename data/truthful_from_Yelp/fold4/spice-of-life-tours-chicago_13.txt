This was amazing! Mohammad is an inspiring man with a beautiful life story who is here to change the world one tour at a time. This tour not only had great food and an amazing culture but the people were all so warm and welcoming. If you have an open mind going into this adventure, it will be well rewarded with much insight into another world far familiar from our own. Some times we become complacent and chauvinist, this tour will challenge that seemingly comfortable mind set and make you appreciate the simple things in life once again. Anyone that has taken this tour will tell you that it is an unforgettable beginning to a life changing journey because you will think differently about a few things ones you are done.
