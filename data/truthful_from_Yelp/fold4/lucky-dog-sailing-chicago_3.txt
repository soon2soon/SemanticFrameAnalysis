We sailed on the Lucky Dog with the Groupon deal this past Saturday. It was a beautiful morning on Lake Michigan. What a wonderful way to start out a weekend!  We had such a great time, my family is thinking of reserving again, even without a Groupon. The boat is gorgeous and easy to find at the Belmont Harbor. Everything went smoothly and it felt incredibly relaxing to be out on the water. Captain Tom and Kristi were great!  They are very knowledgeable and safe sailors and also had a nice, friendly, and laid back attitude. They made sure to sail close to the downtown to get good views of the skyline and also took a lot of photos of our group! Overall, it was such a fun and memorable time!
