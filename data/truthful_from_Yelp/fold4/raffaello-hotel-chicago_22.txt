This place is the BEST!! Two years ago, I bought a pied-a-terre coop on ELSD (one block away) that needed a total gut rehab (1 year project). Instead of living through the mess, I decided to buy a unit at the raffaello for my weekend stays Â (the units are individually owned but rented out when the owners are not staying there). The experience has been so wonderful (from the suite decor to the ultra-friendly and accommodating staff) that there aren't words for it!!! I'm so incredibly impressed with everything that I am actually putting up my coop for sale and keeping THIS place as my weekend place!!! Any negative reviews are absolutely based on unrealistic expectations and, to be quite honest, very cheap people. First of all, this is a "boutique hotel" - it is a very european experience. People who understand this don't have complaints. The people who have problems with this place are people who expect a large resort type experience (think holidome, all-inclusive resorts in mexico, 1000 room las vegas hotels). I have witnessed these trashy people act like morons complaining about the elevators and lack of amenities (just fyi - there is a michelin rated restaurant on the first floor and a very high end popular fun rooftop cocktail lounge on the top floor as well as a business center and a small gym). I have also seen very very trashy cheap people argue over a few dollars - I'm not trying to be a snob- -but the place doesn't deserve any of the negative reviews I have read. Raffaello, maybe you should RAISE prices to keep these people out!!!
