I just returned from a 3-day visit to Chicago and stayed at the Residence Inn Mariott River North. Location: Prime location just north of the Chicago River. The downtown/Loop area is a short walk over the River or an even shorter ride on the El into downtown. Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Hancock Building, Michigan Avenue, etc. are all accessible by foot or public transportation. Check-in: The doormen were always hospitable, nice and outgoing, either welcoming me back or sending me off with a great attitude. Check-in was a breeze, again front desk was very hospitable and genuine. Appearance/Layout: The hotel entrance is on Dearborn. The lobby is on the 2nd floor. The lobby was modern with a large seating area and double-sided fireplace with flat panel tv's above. On the same level is the restaurant seating for breakfast or other functions. The entire face of the hotel are windows so every floor has a great view. The lobby also has a small business center and mini-shopping bar with drinks/beer/ice cream/toiletries/snacks. Room/Cleanliness: I've commented on other hotel rooms and I'm a stickler for cleanliness. The room was spotless, so fresh and so clean, clean. The room layout included a kitchenette area loaded with stove top, refrigerator, all utensils, pots and pans, microwave, dishwasher. The room has a large seating area, eating table with 2 chairs, and a business desk. Amenities: This hotel offers a complimentary breakfast buffet located on the main floor. Also, on the top floor is the gym and indoor pool/jacuzzi overlooking the city of Chicago. On the main floor is the business center. The hotel offers free Wi-fi to guests. Travelers: You may be asking yourself is this a great hotel for kids, families, tourists, business, etc.? This hotel is suitable for all types of guests, based on location, amenities, and service. If you're looking for a great hotel, in a great location, with excellent service and amenities check out this hotel.
