This is what you sorta want in a B&B: cozy to stay in a room, nice to be in a communal area, kitchen available to raid the pastries, nice people, a cat that sometimes insists on his own space,affordable. Staying here with friends, makes it the best of every world: you can gather for food or talking, go to respective rooms, and it's far closer than in a hotel to find your friends or get together for coffee/talking/plotting. Either you'll have a car, or do a bit of walking to get to the major streets. (I used Uber and stayed in the neighborhood.) I'd stay there, just for the frittatas at breakfast.
