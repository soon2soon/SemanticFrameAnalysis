After visiting the Museum Campus, I needed to go to Navy Pier for lunch, options.. bus, cab or walk along the lakefront.  The best option was the water taxi.   The taxi service is $7 for adults and it takes about 10 minutes from the campus to Navy Pier.  Another great way to see the city from from the lake. Did I mention, there is a bar on the boat?  They serve beer, wine, soda and water.  The prices are very reasonable. I would recommend anyone to take the water taxi.  There are three different routes you can take.   So sit back and relax.
