In the future when I have to suffer through another bland business traveller hotel with generic decor I will close my eyes and dream of this place. The Radisson Blu Aqua (RBA) makes a great poster child for showcasing how modern design is by no means boring or bland. My closest comparison is The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, where the latter has more energy but RBA more style. Location could hardly be more central, but you don't have to venture out on the town to find great drinks or food. The options in the hotel would be fit for anyone but the most discerning customer. Spending a few nights at the RBA you're wondering why a brand like Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental will nickel and dime you for Wi-Fi when it's offered free here. Why is it such a process getting another room at a Ritz-Carlton when you're subjugated to construction noise from the floor above when something as simple as a clogged drain will have the staff scrambling to get you a new room here? Both the broad strokes and the little things is what made my stay really come together here. With 6-figures of Club Carlson points just sitting at my account and few worthwhile places to burn it at I heartily welcome a property like this in the USA.
