Contracted for temporary employment for an unknown duration; had a list of necessities that Ryan Corporate Housing met and exceeded! The list included security, covered parking, pool, work out facilities, pet friendly, close to work, ultimate "Chicago" experience. At seconds from the beach, bike trail, the pier and the familiarity experienced every time I walked in the building by the staff this was the ultimate home away from home!! Transition into the apartment was seamless. Few phone calls; online application and all arrangements were made. All of the conveniences  of home. Nick and John went above and beyond to make sure every need was anticipated and met!! Walked in to detailed instructions personalized to meet my needs, orientation literature, home phone, TV/DVD in living room & bedroom. These guys rock! You basically need clothes, toothbrush and frozen pizza. It was quiet and I felt completely safe walking my dog at 1 am and believe me that is saying a lot; I'm a big scaredy cat!   Moving out process? Just as simple. That job of unpredictability ended abruptly and once again the super flexibility of Ryan became apparent as the apartment was rented out in 2 DAYS! Many company's are super accommodating initially but Ryan sustained their superb customer service. Ensuring all my needs were met and going the extra mile to ensure my satisfaction! Did I mention that I switched apartment and Ryan made sure it was completely seamless; moving my stuff for me, putting it up AND even gifting personalized coasters in my new place?!? I travel extensively and have let all the travel companies know that when in Chicago they must use Ryan!! They have been thankful and one employer has already used their services and has been extremely satisfied! Cannot say enough great things about Ryan Housing.
