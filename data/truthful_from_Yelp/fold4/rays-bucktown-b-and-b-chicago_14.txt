I'm not a big B&B user, actually rarely. Normally if I'm in Chicago I would be staying with a major hotel chain. However after giving Ray's a try I'm sold on B&Bs, at least Ray's. Clean, comfortable, inviting, helpful, and above all friendly. The big bonus is the kitchen staff, very talented and will make you anything you ask for. I'm gluten free and that wasn't the problem it is at other places. They were accommodating to all my needs and made the stay very enjoyable. Highly recommend it...
