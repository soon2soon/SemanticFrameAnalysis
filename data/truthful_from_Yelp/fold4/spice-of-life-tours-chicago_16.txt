This was a great tour! There were only three of signed up for this date and time: my husband,our 16 year old son and myself. Other tours might have cancelled, but the tour went as promised and Mr. Ali gave us his time and attention, as though this were supposed to be a private tour. Mr Mohammad Ali was professional, knowledgeable and fun to be with; we soon felt like we were with a friend. We ate and tasted marvelous foods all afternoon, shared stories, had pictures taken in full regal Indian garb ,visited a Sikh temple and learned about the moving history of these people, shopped for treasures (but there was no pressure to buy), did buy a bag full of wonderful spice mixes for all of about 10 dollars, and even had henna tattoos. For 4 hours we forgot we were in Chicago; we were experiencing, learning and truly appreciating a new and distant place .We have travelled extensively, with many tour guides' "Little India" is a cultural treasure and privilege to visit and Mohammad Ali is the person to open it to you. We all three (even our teenage son!) felt Mohammad has developed an amazing experience and goes out of his way to be an amazing, happily memorable host. He has offered to design another tour for us to experience even more tastes and places...we will be back! Please do not miss this truly 5 star experience. Like
