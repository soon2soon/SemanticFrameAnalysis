What a fun, informative tour - and a great way to see the city of Chicago to boot!  As Californians we had never been to Chicago so this was a great way to see areas we might not have otherwise seen.  Seeing the movie clip on the screen first really brought everything to life.  Patrick, our tour guide was awesome!  As a film critic he really knows the film industry, the history and details about the many movies that have been shot in Chicago.  The sense of history was amazing -- Wrigley field, the Biograph theatre (where Dillinger was gunned down) and so many other places that I never knew about (Essanay studios, Chess records).  Well worth the $30 and 2 hours of your time.
