Hands down one of the highlights of the weekend!   Since it was marathon weekend, of course they had lots of requests.  I didn't receive confirmation until two days before that we had a greeter available.  Unfortunately, they had the wrong date.  But luckily I was able to work something out directly with our greeter. Nancy took us around Chicago for about two hours.  After inquiring about what interests we had, she took us all the city from the river, ending at Millennium Park.  We stopped in hotels, stores, businesses, and parks.  She shared so much of Chicago's history and essence of the city and its people.  Despite having run the marathon just the day before, we could have followed her around the city for hours.  I can't wait to do it again!
