Excellent tour. Our guide, Bobby, was very informative and fun, definitely knew his tour and kept things moving. The bus was very comfy. The tour was the perfect length at 90 minutes, during which we got out three times, which sounds like it wouldn't be enough but it was because of Bobby's narration during the drive. We saw mob-type crime stops, famous Dillinger-type places, and then more recent crime places, like the breakout from the downtown prison. We learned a lot and enjoyed it very much - a definite recommend!
