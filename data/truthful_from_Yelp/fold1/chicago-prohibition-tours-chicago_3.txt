Fabulous Chicago outing, even for a resident! Our guide knew everything about Prohibition history and the mafia history of Chicago. And the bars we visited were outstanding - half of which I hadn't even known existed. They said they switch up the bars, so we might go again one day. Next time we have out-of-town guests, we plan to bring them along. Oh, and the drink specials! Excellent.
