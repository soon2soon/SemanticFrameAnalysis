Very relaxing stay. From the moment I walked through the lobby door the staff was very friendly.  The lobby isn't setup like a typical hotel lobby so I was a little thrown off as to who to go to to check in but immediately a staff member walked up to me to direct me to the appropriate station. Check - in was very quick and my room was on the 2nd floor facing Kinzie Street. The view is of the building across the street so if you are looking for views of the city skyline this isn't for you. However I didn't mind. The room was very cute! I loved the decor. Very contemporary.  The hotel offers H2O Plus bath products (love!), free Wi - Fi,  a complimentary drink at the lounge on the 6th floor and free continental breakfast in the morning which is located on each floor. The only con was the lounge is more like a meeting room that is setup with tables and a television with a small bar. However it was cool. A major PLUS is location!!! You are right in the center of all of the great bars/lounges/restaurants like Public House, Sienna Tavern, RPM, Lyfe Kitchen and of course right by the mag mile and don't forget Northbridge mall! Overall I really enjoyed my stay. I will definitely return and recommend to anyone who loves boutique hotels.
