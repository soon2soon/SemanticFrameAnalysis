I realized at 9pm the night before I was supposed to leave for an international vacation (on a 12:15 flight) that my passport was expired!  After a mad dash to the Walgreen's for new passport photos and scheduling an appointment over the phone (I could only get one for 11am), I showed up to the passport agency early (around 8/8:15) with my luggage. The VERY helpful staff at each and every window didn't promise anything, but allowed me in early (with my confirmation number -- that's very important) and told me they would do what they could.  I was fourth through the line, and I had my passport in hand and ready to go by 10:00am.  I cannot thank them for their help enough!  Super professional, super efficient and saved my vacation!!
