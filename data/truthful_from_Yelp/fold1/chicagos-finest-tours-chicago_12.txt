Really fantastic tour. I've lived in Chicago for 8 years, but did this with my mom who was visiting. Since it was a beautiful Chicago day, our guide not only took us through parts of the Pedway, but also spent time outside. I thought that this would just be an underground tour, but I was wrong! We went to several other places. Our guide, Daniel K O Connell, was awesome - he was super funny and really knowledgable. This isn't just a blah blah blah history tour. Do it. You'll love it.
