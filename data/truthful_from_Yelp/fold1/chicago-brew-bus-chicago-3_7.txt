I booked this tour for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and we had a blast. I emailed the company and got a quick response regarding setting up reservations from Kevin. We had a group of 16 with our party and they were very accommodating. The tour guide we had was named Nik and he was great. He even let me decorate the bus with a birthday banner before everyone boarded. The driver played CDs that we had burned which made everyone happy. Before we got to our second stop Nik even had everyone sing to my boyfriend for his birthday, which he loved! The beer selections gave a great sampling of all types of beer and we had plenty of time at each stop to enjoy the beer. I would highly recommend this tour for beer drinks and enthusiasts. It is a great way to see the city and enjoy some drinks along the way!
