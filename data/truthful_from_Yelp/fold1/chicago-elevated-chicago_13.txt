The Boys Town Tour was fantastic. Margaret was funny and well informed, and she gave us a great picture the neighborhood's past and the evolution of Boys Town's culture. The tour does a great job illustrating the neighborhood's history while introducing tour goers to the businesses that make Boys Town tick today. I think my favorite part of the tour was getting to visit bars and businesses I probably would have never visited on my own. Not only do I know much more about queer culture in Chicago, I also know that Kafka's is one of the best wine stores in the city. Can't wait to bring friends from out of town on the Boys Town tour or to join in on Chicago Elevated's next tour.
