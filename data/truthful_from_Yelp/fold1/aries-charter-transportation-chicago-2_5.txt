Leading up to our wedding we had the tough decision of arranging transportation for our wedding guests along with deciding on renting a bus for our rather large wedding party. However after viewing the limo bus options online and being helped quickly with setting up a contract, we knew we had made the right decision. We didnt have to worry about a thing. The wonderful limo bus arrived early to the hotel and even waited on our bridal party to finish with photos before departing to the Church. (BTW - the Limo Bus is gorgeous inside and very comfortable). Anyways, Our driver was very polite and let us not only enjoy the drinks but the different radio stations as well - which helped us relax before the "Big walk down the aisle." After the wedding there was a slight change in plans and we decided to get some outdoor photos before heading to the hotel for the ceremony, however there was nothing to worry about cause they accommodated us with ease and we still got to the reception on time before it started. Great job. Well done!
