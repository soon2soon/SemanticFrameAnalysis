Scrappy underdog wins the day! -----------/------------ What do you do if you own a rather small property surrounded by big names like Wyndham / various Kimpton hotels? You innovate, renovate, and decorate (with a smart interior designer, of course). They definitely know they need to try harder to earn our business, and they do. From free boarding pass printing, to complimentary wifi throughout the hotel, to purified water dispensers using plastic bottles with caps that can be locked upon closing (like a commercial bottle of soda), to a decent fitness room with towels and flat screen TV, this place does not disappoint. The initial room had a terrible view of the back alleyway, but this was switched to a larger, rectangular room - with a pull out sofa, and an awesome view of Wacker drive. The interior designer did a very good job at packing room amenities with a minimum of space. For example, the bathroom had a sliding frosted glass door. The shower was very modern, and used a heavy duty curtain rather than a bulky enclosure. Thought small, the room did not feel cramped by any means. Plus there was a mini fridge as well. Definitely will consider coming back to this property the next time I'm in Chicago.
