This is quite the cool, funky, hip hotel of Chicago that is quite affordable if you do your research. The location is amazing and the value for what you get is amazing and the attention to detail is second to none. I booked this hotel last minute and was pleasantly surprised by the size and the amenities (my room came with a separate living area). This is definitely a place I will bookmark for my next trip to Chicago.
