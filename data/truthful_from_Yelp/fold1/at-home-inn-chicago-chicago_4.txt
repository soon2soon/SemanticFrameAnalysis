Our other rental cancelled on us a little over a week from our weekend trip. The staff at At Home Inn came to the rescue. We loved the location near Clark and Diversey with wonderful access to great bars and restaurants and especially the lakefront! There were plenty of towels and the use of codes vs keys is genius! We were a group coming at all different times and it was great to have the freedom. Hopefully I'll get to use this rental company again!
