Wow, the hotel staff and manager were the most helpful people we have met in a long time on our travels. The rooms were great and they have FREE bottled waters for all guests. We booked our hotel on priceline the first night, my boyfriend got the stomach flu and we decided to stay another night for him to get some rest. It was cheaper again on priceline so I tried to book, and got a different hotel. Moving to a different hotel 2km away in the snow was not ideal. As we were checking out we told the concierge what had happened and he insisted that we stay and they would transfer the reservation at no extra charge! The friendliest and most helpful staff. I will stay here next time we come to Chicago!
