I didn't stay here, but was working at an event.  I had a lot of contact with two employees of the hotel, and they're both outstanding.  Shantel Bridges and Aaron (didn't get his last name) work with events and they're both highly professional and were very willing to go out of their way to accommodate whatever needs any of the vendors setting up the wedding had.  I would highly consider this hotel based on their expertise and professionalism.
