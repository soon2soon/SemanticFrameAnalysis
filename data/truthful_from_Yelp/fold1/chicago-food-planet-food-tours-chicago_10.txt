Just finished the Bucktown/Wicker park tour and what a treat! Â Christina was our tour guide and absolutely amazing. She was funny, knowledgable, and so passionate about all the restaurants we visited as well as the neighborhoods. We also went on a tour of some of the houses in the area, so we got an awesome history lesson as well. The food at all the locations was very good - generous portions, especially for a tour visiting 6 locations - and my only regret is that we aren't staying in the area, and that time is limited, so we likely won't be back in the area to visit the places for a full meal!
