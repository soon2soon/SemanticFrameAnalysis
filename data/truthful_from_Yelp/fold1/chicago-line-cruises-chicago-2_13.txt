We were told it was a MUST to go on this cruise, and I have to agree. We booked the earliest possible (new parents just don't sleep past 7 even w/out the kid present) and we found out the early morning tour is cheaper.  Hazzah! Not the best day to be out, but the crew were entertaining and beyond factual.  the 90 mins flew by as I tried to listen and take as many photos as possible.  Our guide spoke for nearly the entire time we were out and was very informative. As for patrons: if the tour company tells you to show for 7:30, show for 7:30 and not 8:05.  That's just rude.
