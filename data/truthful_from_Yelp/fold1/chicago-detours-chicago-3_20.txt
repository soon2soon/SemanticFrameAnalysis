Being a first time visitor to Chicago I really appreciated and enjoyed the walking tour with Chicago Detours. There's so much rich history about the city, it was great learning about buildings we probably would have never paid much attention to or glanced at otherwise. Our tour guide Elizabeth was lovely and as a Chicago native and history buff, very knowledgable about building architecture and the city's history. Definitely wear comfortable shoes for this tour as it is about two hours and your poor feet will be sore! One of my favourite parts of the tour was seeing the beautiful stained glass dome ceiling at the Chicago Cultural Center. The details were so amazing and beautiful. The tour included the use of some iPads which showed some video clips and photos, a nice add on.
