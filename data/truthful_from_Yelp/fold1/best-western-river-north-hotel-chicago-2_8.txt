The restaurant has great food, they have a nice pool, great rooms, and great helpful concierge. I was surprised how affordable it was, especially in downtown Chicago. The concierge apologized for problems that were my fault and even provided me with amenities to smooth things over. The parking attendant put up with my annoying requests and was nice about it. I even asked for a higher story room and they changed me to a HUGE room upstairs, it was great! I will stay here every time I come to downtown Chicago.
