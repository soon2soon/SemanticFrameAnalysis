The best hotel to stay at in Chicago, by far. Gorgeous rooms, friendly staff, close to great spots like Wrigley Field and Lake Shore Drive. Lakeview is the true heart of Chicago, and this hotel perfectly embodies that. Regardless of the time, there was always a friendly staff member greeting us from behind the desk. There was a small error with our reservation (computer error, not theirs!) and they went above and beyond by not only fixing the issue, but also sending chocolates to our room the following night! They were also great for helping with the train and bus schedules. After three stays, this is the only hotel I'll consider staying at in Chicago. Absolutely worth the money.
