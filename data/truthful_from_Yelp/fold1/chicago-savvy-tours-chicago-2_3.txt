My adult son and I took the Frank Lloyd Wright Oak Park buss and walking tour yesterday . The tour director was very knowledgable and enthusiastic about Frank Lloyd Wright. He was able to include information on the architectural Â ideas and other architects designing at the time. When we looked at the Oak Park Wright designed homes he could answer any questions that that were asked . I recommend the tour to anyone interested in Wright.h
