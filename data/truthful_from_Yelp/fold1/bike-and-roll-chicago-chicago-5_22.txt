Chicago Bike AND Roll Tour with Bianca! Going on the Segway tour was a great experience, and deserves a five star review! Our tour guide BIANCA made the tour so much fun. Bianca was friendly, knowledgeable, and made everyone feel comfortable.  We had some guests in from out of town, and wanted to show them how beautiful and friendly the chi town is. Wow, did we get lucky because they were nervous and not from this country.  Our tour went along the river walk and the museum campus.  Despite the extreme hot HEAT she was patient and made sure everyone was prepared for our ride.  I never write reviews; and could not help but take a moment and to highly recommend her.  If you are coming to town (or just want to have fun) and want to try the Chicago Bike and Roll tour try and get with Bianca!  You and your guest will have a lot of fun!
