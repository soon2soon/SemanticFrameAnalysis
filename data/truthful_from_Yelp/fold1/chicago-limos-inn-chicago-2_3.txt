El and team are very gracious and accommodating to their clients.  I travel on a weekly basis and had used a few different car companies before moving to Chicago, but this group has always gone that extra mile to make my arrival home a bit more welcoming.   I have been using Chicago Limos Inn, Inc. now for 5 years, and do not envision switching anytime soon.
