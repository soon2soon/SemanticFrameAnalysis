Wow, what a charmer and so near Water Tower Place plus plus plus.  I live in the city and treated myself to a night at Affinia where I got a great rate (no, I don't remember) mostly because I wanted to try out C-House.  My room was just a treat--I only regret spending so little time in it because C-House was so great we stayed until after 11:00 and I had to go to work the next morning.  The room--1607--the desk was near the entry door overlooking the 'bedroom' three steps above the main room.  Great view of LARGE TV (but that seems to be standard nowadays).  The couch was comfortable and at a good distance from the bed with great reading lamps.  The bathroom entry was off to the side and not visible from the bed.  Loved the sense of being on a high floor--not a vista view for sure but a sense of tall, tall, tall.  The reception staff member when i checked in was very positive and upbeat!  This is a fabulous charming place to stay (and eat)--don't forget the 29th floor bar with outdoor space for summer.
