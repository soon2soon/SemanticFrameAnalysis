We stayed at the Affinia Chicago in the early summer of last year for about 4 nights and were extremely pleased with the accommodations. Not only is the location excellent (right next to Gino's East and walking distance to several landmarks), but the staff is extremely helpful, and the rooms are extremely clean and seem like they're recently renovated. The hotel has a rooftop bar and the view from up there is absolutely beautiful. Before this trip we hadn't stayed at an Affinia hotel before and were so happy with our stay that we decided to try at the Affinia Dumont in Manhattan on our next trip to New York. We were disappointed. Although the Dumont wasn't a terrible hotel, it was nowhere near as grand Â as the one in Chicago. I will absolutely be staying at the Affinia each and every time I return to Chicago and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to this beautiful city.
