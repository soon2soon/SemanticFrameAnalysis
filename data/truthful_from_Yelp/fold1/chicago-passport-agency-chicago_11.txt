Realized my passport was expired the day before leaving for Mexico. I arrived at the passport agency Monday morning at 8am, by 9:15 I had already gone through security and paid for a new passport. I returned back at 1pm and waited less than hour to pickup my new passport. Be sure to make an appointment ahead of time and bring all the necessary documents. You are guaranteed to walk out with a new passport in the same day.
