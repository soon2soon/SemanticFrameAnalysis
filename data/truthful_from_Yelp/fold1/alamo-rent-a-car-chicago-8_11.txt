We flew into Chicago late at night and caught the shuttle to Alamo. Â Eric, the young man checking us in was great. Very personable and professional. He went out with us to get our car and they didn't have what we'd reserved but he said, I'll take care of you and ran off. Drove up un about 3 minutes with a great vehicle, better than we'd thought we would get. He was so helpful and nice. Wonderful representative for the company. We will use Alamo again because of the attention we received!
