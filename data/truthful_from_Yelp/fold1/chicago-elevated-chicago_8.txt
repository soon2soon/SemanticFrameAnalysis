This is a must-do if visiting Chicago!!!  We took the Pedway tour on a Saturday.  Margaret was awesome!  She was funny, full of energy and very knowledgeable about the city!  There wasn't a question we asked that she couldn't answer!  We were simply delighted with our experience!  We will definitely do another tour with her on our next visit!
