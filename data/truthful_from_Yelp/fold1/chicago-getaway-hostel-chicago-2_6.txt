I stayed here back in late 2012 (November or December) when I had to go to Chicago to get my visa from the French Consulate. We wanted to stay somewhere in the middle of things for cheaper than a hotel, so we were happy to find this hostel. I was a little wary at first--I had never stayed in a hostel--but staying here actually introduced me to the hostel world, with which I would become incredibly familiar during my time studying abroad. Everything about this place was awesome. The ambiance was relaxing and cool, the rooms were great, the beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. They even let us keep the car parked for a few hours after the usual time so we could go explore the city throughout the day. I know this hostel definitely factored into my enjoyment of my trip to chicago and it's part of the reason I want to go back someday. I would stay here again if I did!
