Margaret is top-notch!   I'm a tough-sell because I travel a lot and I was in the entertainment industry for many years--I'm real tuned-in to presentation and also noting the level of commitment when someone is doing a creative job.  I work in the historical area of Philadelphia and am surrounded by tours.   My comments are based on the Pedway Tour.   I had all these worries about taking the tour, (1) guide would be over-energized, ie. annoying.  Margaret has tons of energy, but it's focused on making the tour enjoyable for all different types of people so she's upbeat w. a focussed, productive energy. (2) guide would be disinterested, and just there to make some money.  Margaret was completely present, had done tons of research and legwork, completely committed to sharing the city.  (3) pace would be too-slow or too-fast.  We moved along, but not too fast or too slow, Margaret knows how to engage people if someone is "catching up" or can corral the group if we need to move.  (4) tour would be boring.  We saw so much incredible real estate, accessing the downtown from underground pedestrian walkways, then coming up into amazing urban spaces.   This is not a "dry" touristy, cheeseball look at the city, it was hip, fun, with lots of "wow" moments.  I learned a lot about how the downtown was built, where the money came from, some juicy gossip about controversial art projects, such a great way to get to know the city. Plenty of "eye candy".   I had a blast.   When someone finds something they are great at and shares it, you can just feel an aliveness in the air.   Go for it--this is a "must do" in Chicago.
