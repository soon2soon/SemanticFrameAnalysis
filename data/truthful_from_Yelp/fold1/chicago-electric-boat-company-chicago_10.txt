We went on 9/22/12 from 6 to 8 pm and totally enjoyed ourselves!  I am glad I read the other reviews to find out where to go. It's in the glass hut in the circle area of the House of Blues. Can't see it off the street.  A couple of us were running a little late from traffic and I was worried it would affect our time on the boat with watching the safety video, but they were kind enough to extent our time by the ten minutes (think they were a little slow that night due to the weather). We really appreciated that extension given. While it was colder out, the windows help keep the wind out and make it pleasant in side. We used our ipod for music, and was surprised that the speakers were quite good.  The river was really quite so it made for a nice stress free ride up and down the river. I can imagine it being more difficult on a very hot busy day on the river. The views are amazing, and not one you get often from this angle. We hope they will do another deal again for next year, we already started to tell our friends to save some dates!
