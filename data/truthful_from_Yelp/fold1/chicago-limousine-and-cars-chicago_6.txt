I'm really happy with Chicago Limousine & Cars. I hired them for my anniversary. The stretch limo picked us up from our house in Evanston and brought us to the Signature room in the Hanckock Tower, where the driver waited for us and took us back home when we were finished. Since it was nighttime, I asked him to do a couple circles around downtown area (Chicago is simply beautiful at night , especially on Upper Wacker by the river). The driver said no problem and drove us around for quite a bit. I was very happy and my wife was very impressed (dinner at 95th was great too!), she especially enjoyed the limo ride, said she liked the neons inside a lot. Very happy with my choice of limousine company!
