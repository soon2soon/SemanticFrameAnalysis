We did the presidential bike tour in Hyde Park in March 2013 with Vincent. It was great - his enthusiasm really made a difference for us and he went out of his way to show us all his favorite spots.  We saw the Obamas first apartment, his bachelor pad, barber shop, etc.  Plus did a tour around University of Chicago, on the lake and the Japanese Gardens.  He basically took us everywhere! It was just 4 of us and it felt like a private tour that he didn't want to end!  Since when do you have a guide that just keeps going like that!  He was really awesome - and his joy for his city is infectious and really made the tour a pleasure...
