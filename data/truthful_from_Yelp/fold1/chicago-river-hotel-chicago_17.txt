This hotel was very nice! Right when my family and I walked in, we were greeted with fantastic service. The staff was very welcoming and helped us with everything from directions to getting us an extra toothbrush. The two bedroom suite was very nice and the accommodations were great as well. On top of that, it's at a great location with lots to do all around it. Fun stay!
