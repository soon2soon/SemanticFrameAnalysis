This was one of the best parts of our entire Chicago trip! Karen, our tour guide, was funny, engaged, and knowledgeable. The bites and brews were incredible. And I absolutely loved how many different parts of Chicago we got to see--and on bikes, no less! I'll definitely take a Bobby's Bike Hike whenever I'm back in Chicago!
