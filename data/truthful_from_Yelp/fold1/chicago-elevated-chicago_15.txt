The tour guide is so funny and informative! I really dug this tour as it was a lot more informal and laid back then some other tours. Plus, I didn't feel like I was stuck on a bus, or boat. Nothing better than walking around and learning about Chicago at a walkable pace. I would recommend this for anybody looking for a cheap and fun way to see the city. Great for vacationers, but also really good for those who think they know everything about the city. Well worth it, I would do it again!
