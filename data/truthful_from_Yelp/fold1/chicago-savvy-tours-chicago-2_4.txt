The Frank Lloyd Wright Tour was amazing with George Pudlo, our guide!  I have visited the Wright home and studio many times, and toured many of Wright's buildings, as well as done the walking tour in Oak Park.  I didn't think I had much more to learn, I was taking this tour with people visiting from out of town.  But I was wrong!  George impressed me with his knowledge and enthusiasm, and I learned a lot!  I would definitely recommend this tour to others, and will try Savvy Tours other offerings in the future!
