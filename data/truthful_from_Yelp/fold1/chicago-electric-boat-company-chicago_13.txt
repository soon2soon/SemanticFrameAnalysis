Had a fantastic time on a beautiful afternoon on the river with the boat!  Had the groupon and took the family(husband and 2 kids, 9 and 7).  We had a small cooler and picked up a couple sandwiches for lunch, and headed out onto the water.  Once you get used to the boats everywhere, it's pretty much smooth sailing.  We went east to navy pier, then decided to head south past Chinatown.  It was great to be on our own and go where we wanted.  Would love to do it again, and i also agree with the great customer service .  Very friendly
