A perfect airport for connecting. A great place to be able to hit the moving walks to get from one concourse to the other. I've also never had a problem making connections because they'll call and check on connections. Southwest comes here and so it's usually a stop for my travels both south and north from Midwest, or to. Vendors like everywhere else are overpriced, but that's normal.
