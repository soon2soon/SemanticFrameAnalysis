Rachael was our guide on the old town / gold coast tour. Even though it rained she kept the tour up beat and she was friendly throughout. We checked out the neighborhood and it's wonderful. We tasted pizza, iced tea, pastries, olive oil, and checked out a really unique spice shop. You have to go if you want to truly see the neighborhood of Chicago and not just Michigan ave
