We searched WEEKS for a hotel to stay at for our 5 day trip to Chicago. From the Langham to Marriott to Hiltons. We checked yelp and trip advisor. It was our first time in Chicago so I wanted it to be a cool spot but not gimmicky or traditional. I was pretty much being a pain in the ass. We suddenly came across the Acme and loved everything we saw. The price was unbeatable, they had a special where we got one night FREE. Not too bad for a new years week! But above all the best thing the Acme has Is the Berkshire bar downstairs! Luke was great. They also deliver FREE coffee to your room every night. Don't look elsewhere, you really can't beat out this place. It has the 3 most important qualities you should look for in a hotel; price, location, quality! !
