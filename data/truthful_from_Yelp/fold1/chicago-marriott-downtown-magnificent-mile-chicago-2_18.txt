This review is long overdue. I travel to Chicago around three times a year and always try to book here first. I haven't had a bad view in this place, and hello, chocolates on my pillow at turn-down service time! You know you're staying at a good hotel when your appendix bursts, and the staff spoils you rotten for the rest of your stay. (Yes, I had my appendix removed at the hospital and returned to my business stay because I'm awesome like that.) Clean, modern, and accommodating. Those are my three adjectives to sum up this place. It's lovely! Oh, and Marriott points accrue much faster than Hilton points, just sayin'.
