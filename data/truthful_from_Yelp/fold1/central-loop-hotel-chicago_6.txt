Location, location, location. We wanted to be within walking distance of major attractions and that's what we got. The rooms are small but perfect for two people. I'm a smells and noise person and both passed the test. We were on the 6th floor and there was very little noise and the room smelled very clean. I really appreciated the fill your own water bottles and purified water located on our floor. Grabbing a free bottle of water as we headed out to explore the city was a bonus. Parking at a fair daily rate was available, albeit about 3 blocks away. We also loved that a good cup of coffee was right next door! We will definitely stay here again.
