I took the Parks, River and Architecture tour today.  Aaron was our tour guide and he was FANTASTIC!  The tour left right on time.  Everyone received individual instruction on how to operate the Segway (which is super easy) and also had time to practice.  We went up Michigan Avenue, through an upscale neighborhood, up and down the Riverwalk, and then down Lakeshore Drive to Buckingham fountain.  Aaron gave us interesting information on many of the buildings, architects, fountains, etc. We stopped a few times for picture-taking opportunities.  It was a lot of fun and Aaron kept us laughing the whole time.  I live in Chicago but I would recommend this tour to anyone, whether a tourist or a resident.  I plan to do it again next summer.  Thanks Aaron!
