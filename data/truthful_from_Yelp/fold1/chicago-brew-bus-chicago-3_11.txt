My boyfriend and I did this tour last weekend, and it was fantastic. We were on a tour with a group of 12 friends, and we had an absolute blast. We started at Goose Island, then went to Haymarke Brewery next and ended at Moonshine. Each place was unique and fun in its own way. And the quality of beer at each was top-notch..or so my boyfriend said. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but even I found a few that I truly enjoyed (the pumpkin ale at Goose Island, for one). The tour guides also set me up with a beer cocktail and a mojito, free of charge, knowing I wasn't a huge fan of beer. The tour guides couldn't have been nicer. They were incredibly friendly and laid-back, and had a significant amount of knowledge about beer. They shared some history of Chicago brewing in between breweries. Fun facts - not boring babble. We toured the brewing process at Haymarket and also ordered food there. But even if you don't to get food, they stock the bus with chips so you can refuel in beween stops. Awesome. I HIGHLY recommend this tour. It's fun to do as a couple or with a group of friends. We ended up meeting some pretty awesome people in the process, too, which is always fun in a big city. This tour has everything you want, and nothing you don't. We even stayed an extra hour at the last place, since we were the last tour of the day, and wanted to order more the beers we sampled. DO THIS TOUR!
