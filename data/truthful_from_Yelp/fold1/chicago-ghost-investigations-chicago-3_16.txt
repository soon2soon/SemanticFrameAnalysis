We took my son and five other boys for his 15th birthday. We had a blast. Our guide was very friendly and knowledgable. The warehouse was the perfect place to look for ghosts. This was our second time there and it was just as exciting as the first. We had so much fun using the divination rods to communicate with the ghosts. Â It is so easy to schedule and arrange to go. We'll go again for sure.
