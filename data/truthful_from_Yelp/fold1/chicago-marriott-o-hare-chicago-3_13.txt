Stayed here last night and it was awesome.  A friend and me wanted something different to do so we decided to get a room here so we can swim and have a nice dinner. The pool is top notch.  The indoor pool is connected to the outdoor pool by a divider that you swim under.  It's really cool to go out to the outdoor pool when it's a little bit cold out. They keep it open all year round and when it's really cold it's really steamy pretty sweet.  Plenty of clean towels and the whirlpool was clean and hot. We didn't go to any of the hotel restaurants, but She and I ordered a pizza from room service, and it was surprisingly very good.  The sauce was flavorful and there were ample toppings on it.  They have a deal where you get a pizza and 4 beers for 25.00 and that is the way to go.  The pizza was better than dominos and arrived in a little under twelve minutes which is ok in my book. The bed in the place is what I want my bed to be when I grow up.  It is huge, has lots of pillows and is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Don't get any dirty ideas kiddos she likes woman, but if you wanted to get down and dirty the bed is big enough to hold an orgy of at least 6 people! The price of the room was very reasonable for a weekend night on short notice.  I rented the room for under 70, which is a steal in my book.  I love coming to this place it's like going on a little mini vacation.
