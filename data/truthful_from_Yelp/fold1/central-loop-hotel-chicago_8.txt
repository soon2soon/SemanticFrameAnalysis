For the price and the location you can't beat it. Â Service is excellent, the rooms are very thoroughly cleaned each day, and for business travelers the WiFi here is among the best I've seen at a hotel. Even during a peak time the speeds were more than adequate for getting things done. The bed was a little uncomfortable and the room is small, but for the price and location you won't do better. And the best part is that you really don't have to compromise on quality to save a few bucks.
