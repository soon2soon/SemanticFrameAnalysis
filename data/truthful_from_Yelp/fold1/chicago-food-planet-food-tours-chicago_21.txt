I have taken three food tours in Chicago and this was by far the best!  Our tour guide, Angie, was upbeat, very knowledgeable and funny.  She made us all feel comfortable and welcome.  The tour not only provided us with great food but also with information about the history of the establishments and the food that we tasted.  One of the highlights was a visit to a spice shop.  The owner, who was very passionate about spices, gave us the history of the spice trade and some spefics about certain spices.     A big plus was touring the neighborhoods of the Gold Coast and Old Town.  Angie took us by some famous residences and told us about the history of those residences and of the neighborhoods.   The walk was comfortable and easy even for those out of shape.  There was a good balance of eating and walking. I recommend this tour to all who want to learn about Chicago neighborhoods and taste authentic local foods!
