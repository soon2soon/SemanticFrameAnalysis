This is such a fun way to spend your afternoon! Nick is so great and we had a BLAST!! We went with 3 other couples and had the greatest time. You get to sample plenty of beers at all three breweries and they are all very different and a good time! I definitely recommend the Chicago Brew Bus!!! You even get to drink on the bus. This is great for bday parties and bachelor/ette parties too!
