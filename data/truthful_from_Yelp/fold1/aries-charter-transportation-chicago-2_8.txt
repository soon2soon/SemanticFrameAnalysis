We rented a 29 passenger mini bus to shuttle guests between the hotel and the wedding location.  I am really glad that I went with Aries.  They had a good price and excellent customer service.  Lisa in the office answered all my questions promptly and did everything she said on time.  The booking process went very smoothly. As for the buses our first trip I was worried because of traffic in Chicago.  The bus though was right on time.  We made it to the wedding and had no issues.  The driver was very nice and made our guests feel welcome in our great city. The return trips also went perfectly.  We arranged to take half the people at 9:30pm and half at 10:30pm and it ran like clockwork.  This driver also was very courteous and took great care of us.   My sister and her new husband will forever remember how the one thing that ran smoothly for their wedding was the buses.   Thanks Aries for your awesome  service. Sincerely, Luke
