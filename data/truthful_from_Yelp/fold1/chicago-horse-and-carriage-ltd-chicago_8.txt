What an excellent experience. Don came up with the idea to pick me an my wife up after dinner at Catch 35. She was right on time and very respectful or both my wife and I. Don filled us in on little Picts o info about this city and talked a bit about his horse. He truly cares about his horses and doesn't over work them. I will defiantly take advantage of this hidden gem again. Look for Don! He is great!
