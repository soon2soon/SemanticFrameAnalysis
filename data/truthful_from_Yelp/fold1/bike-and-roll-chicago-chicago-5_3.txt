My husband and I found this deal through LivingSocial after his parents raved about how much fun they had doing a Segway tour in Phoenix.  We have to agree with them!  Segway tours are definately the way to go.  You cover a lot of ground and see things from a totally different perspective.  We had a blast! Matt was FANTASTIC!  He really knows his history and the pride he has for Chicago is infectious!  Only thing I would change is the break at 12th St. Beach seemed a little long.
