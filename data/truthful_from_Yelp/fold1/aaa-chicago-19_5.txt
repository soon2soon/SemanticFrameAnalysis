AAA wins my affection, yet again. We blew a tire on a trip home to Michigan. Bummer, but it happens. Not only was the girl on the phone amazing/responsive, but clued me into a major moneysaver. If you are more than 100 miles away from your home address and something like this happens...AAA will reimburse you for your hotel/meals until you can get back on your way. That means that my $175 Hampton-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, MI cost me exactly $0. Now, that's service. I'd have never known this had she not let me know. Surely, it pays for itself. It indeed does. Over and over again. If you drive and don't have it, I implore you to do it. They were out to fix my flat in 20 minutes, popped on the donut, reimbursed me for my hotel stay and did so with a smile. Easy peasy. As it should be.
