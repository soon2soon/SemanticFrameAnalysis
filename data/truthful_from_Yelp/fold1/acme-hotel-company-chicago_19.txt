LOVED THIS HOTEL. WILL STAY HERE EVERY TIME I'M IN CHICAGO. Let's be real, this city has some expensive hotels, and I was attracted to ACME Hotel because of the high yelp rating and low price.  I was a little nervous/skeptical - "why is it so much less than these pricey, luxury, big-name hotels?"  Upon checking in, my worries faded.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating and the room (while small) was clean, cute, and strategically planned. There is no closet, so if you are someone who absolutely must have a closet while traveling, I guess this isn't the place for you, but they do have hooks to hang up nicer items.  It was super quiet, which is uncommon for this area of Chicago, and everything (TV, shower, AC, etc) was great - they even gave us a newspaper each morning.  The cafe downstairs is amazeballs - and you're right next to Eataly!  I'm definitely coming back to this amazing city, and I will 100% be staying at Acme!
