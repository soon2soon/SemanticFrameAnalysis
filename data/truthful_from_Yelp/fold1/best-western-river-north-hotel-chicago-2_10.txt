This is an amazing hotel and the ONLY hotel in the downtown area with free parking!  We stayed here two nights in January, 2013!  They are centrally located, close to Magnificent Mile, Hard Rock Cafe Chicago, and walking distance to the Millenium and Grant Park.  We did rent a car, and it was the right thing to do as we wanted to drive around not only Chicago but the outskirts of Chicago too.  This hotel was perfect!  It was priced reasonably and the free parking at night was awesome!  In comparison, Crown Plaza is $50 a night for parking.  We loved having a car - so much easier to see the city and the car was $40 for two days via Enterprise.  The hotel sells discounted tickets to several sightseeing spots - Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Museum of Science and Industry and the Skydeck.  I purchased several and on checkout, whatever you don't use, they will buy back.  So it is quite a deal!  We did end up going to the Skydeck, Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium.  There is a fitness area and indoor pool!  Hard Rock Cafe Chicago is one block away, and our first night we walked there, and enjoyed live entertainment from a couple local musicians!  I was with my daughter in her twenties, so it was outstanding!  The hostess waived the cover feee for us (as there was a young unknown musician there).  She was awesome, but unknown!  We felt lucky to listen to her original songs.  Anyway, the Best Western is the place to go especially if you've got a car!  Wallace was down by the coffee (kind of like the greeter) and was awesome as were ALL the folks at the front desk!  The coffee was delicious, and the facilities were spotless!  The room was spacious (though the beds were definitely smaller than what was at Crown Plaza).   For us, it didn't matter!  The location, the staff, the free parking, the facilties and the cleanliness all made a difference in our stay, and the hands down rating for us is five stars!!
