I want to say I've taken five or six sessions (4 weeks each) of the cardio kayak classes here and went on the Kankakee river & Crane viewing trip last year and I can't complain about anything! I went to a Cardio Kayak class with a few friends a couple of years ago.  I wouldn't call myself a very athletic person and I've never been all that interested in the outdoors or nature.  At first, I found kayaking a bit challenging and was pretty sore after the classes.  It was something different for me, but I really started to enjoy it after a few times on the water.   During your first class, the instructors give you the basics and help you develop proper technique along the way.  All of the staff that I've met have been very friendly and helpful, which makes it a great activity for beginners.
