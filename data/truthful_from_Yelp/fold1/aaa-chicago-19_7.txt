Triple A has saved my life on at least 10 occasions. When you have a car with almost 260,000 miles on it, you might expect that something like a AAA membership is a necessity. My mom bought it for me as a birthday present 3 years ago and has renewed it for me every year and I'm so happy she has. Go mom! The only downside is that you usually have to wait about an hour for a tow unless you're in some sort of immediate danger, then they'll rush the tow. Not bad but it seems that every time I need the tow, my phone is dead so I'm just sitting there staring off into space for 60 minutes. I have two great AAA moments. My first one was when I threw my keys in my purse on my lunch break one afternoon and then left my purse in the car and you guessed it, locked the doors. Totally embarrasing, blonde moment! AAA paid for a locksmith to come out and get my keys out of my car. My second favorite moment was when my starter (or was it the alternator? I really don't know much about cars) went out and the guy came out and hit it up with a hammer and it started long enough for me to make it to Meineke for repairs. Did you ever know that you're my hero, AAA?
