I am not a tourist...ok I am. I have been to Chicago many times as my husband is native. My grandmother has always wanted to come to the Windy City and finally we got it together to get her up here, along with my mother, to crash at my mother in law's place and play tourist with us! This boat tour was the highlight of our touristic adventure. And I hate being a tourist. The information was plentiful, the guide was funny and laid back at the same time as being pleasantly informative- without making it sound like a lecture! The boat was nice, the seats not uncomfortable, and my husband liked the beer options at the bar. Can't complain about much else.
