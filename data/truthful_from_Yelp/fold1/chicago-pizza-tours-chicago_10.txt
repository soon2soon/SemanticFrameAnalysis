It was the first visit to Chicago for myself, the bf and a gf so I knew that we had to indulge in deep dish pizza.  My only previous exposure was at the chain UNOS pizzeria in my hometown and that was just not very good. So we bought tickets online for the pizza tour that promised spots at four different locations with transportation via tour bus.  At the starting location, we met with the owner and the very knowledgeable pizza tour guide.  He was personable and used to be tour guide for the city so he happily divulge non-pizza related facts about the city. Surprisingly the tour was very filling considering we only went to four locations.  Our tour consisted of two slices of deep dish pizza and 4 slices of tavern style pizza.  The tour ran a bit longer than stated, about an hour later.  I wasn't complaining though since I found the tour and guide very entertaining.  But for though who make any time sensitive plans, be aware. I'm glad we went on this tour.  It ended up being my favorite part of the Chicago visit..But then again, I really really like pizza.
