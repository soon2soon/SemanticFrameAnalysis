Just returned from an eight day Panama Tour. It was a great tour led by Yani,a very informative and enthusiastic guide. The tour included a partial transit through the Canal, sightseeing in Panama City as well as two nights in the rainforest and two nights at an all inclusive Westin on the beach. All of the hotels were superior, and all meals were included, as well ( great value for the tour price). Airfare is not included;we flew Copa direct from Boston which only added to our enjoyment of this vacation! Caravan also has tours of Costa Rica and is looking into adding Cuba. Check them out for your next trip!
