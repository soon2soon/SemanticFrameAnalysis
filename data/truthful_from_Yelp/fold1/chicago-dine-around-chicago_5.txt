This is the first time we had used Chicago Dine Around, and it was by far the best part of our trip to Chicago. We chose the dining tour for a corporate event, while our company attended a convention in Chicago in early June. The progressive dining tour provided a little something for everyone, whether it was the fresh vegetarian starters at Reza's, architectural bus tour for our designers in the team, and the delicious hearty meal at Francesca's Italian. The jazz club (Back Room) at the end of the night knocked it out of the park, however! Perfect venue, and we had our entire team up in front of the stage, dancing and singing along. The Progressive Dining Tour by Chicago Dine-Around was an event unlike anything I've ever done- I have been recommending it to family and friends. The event really focuses on interactivity- we had 52 employees come in from Norway, Germany, Mexico, and all over the US, who were able to mix and mingle as they changed seating during the appetizer, main, and dessert courses at the 3 venues. Not one of our employees was left unhappy. It is still by far my favorite experience in Chicago, and Chicago Dine Around really puts on a great show. One thing that made this trip extremely memorable was the awesome service provided by the staff. Frank, the bus driver, was wonderful about letting us stay at the Jazz Club later than expected (we honestly didn't want to leave!). And Brandon was incredible- He was quick to provide answers and info via phone call 2 months in advance, and literally guided us through the entire event. Even when our employees changed up their orders last minute (the restaurant wasn't too pleased), Brandon was able to smooth things over with the restaurant venue, and give us the experience of a lifetime. Our international employees were left with an amazing impression of Chicago, thanks to Chicago Dine Around. Make sure to request Brandon as your rep. He gives a great a seated bus tour, and is incredibly easy to work with!
