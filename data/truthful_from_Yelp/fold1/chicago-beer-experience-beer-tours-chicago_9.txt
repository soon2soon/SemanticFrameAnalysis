We did their Lincoln Park beer tour 2 birthdays ago and loved it so when I saw they added a Wicker Park/Bucktown tour it was a no-brainer for my husband's birthday gift this year. Our tour guides - two fun, beer loving women - kicked things off by pouring our first tastes and having everyone introduce themselves and say what kind of beers they enjoy before giving us a brief intro on how to taste beer. We held it to the light, breathed it in and held it on our tongues in the most pretentious way possible. We were then assured we didn't have to do that for each beer. The tour stops at four neighborhood bars with 4 samples at each equating to roughly 4 beers total. Although we live in the neighborhood we had only been to one of the bars so this was a day of discovery. All the chosen bars are locally owned and the guides mix in neighborhood and bar fun facts along with deeper information about the beers we were tasting. You definitely get your money's worth and get a wide variety of beers to try. This tour gets a little more food in your belly which you will certainly need. Not sure if it's the same for every tour but we enjoyed a Chicago style hot dog while at Lemming's and some Chicken pot pie from Silver Cloud. This is a great tour to bring out-of-town guests on to see a non-touristy side of Chicago, but also a great way to spend a day with friends!
