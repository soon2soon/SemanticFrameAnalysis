I have been on these boats twice and was worried that it wouldnt be as much fun the second time around. Not the case. There are always new things to see. This is one of the treats to living in a beautiful city. I cannot recommend this experience enough. The staff was SOOOO wonderful. They were overaccomodating and sang happy birthday over the walkie talkie while we were crusin. If you get a chance to do this, DO IT! It is hard to get an available date so book in advance.
