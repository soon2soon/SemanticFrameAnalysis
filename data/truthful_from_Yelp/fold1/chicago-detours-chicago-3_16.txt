The Historic Chicago Pub Crawl is definitely one of the highlights of my Chicago trip.  Elizabeth was extremely knowledgeable, fun, and so easy to get along with!  I learned so much more than I would have from just printing out a self guided tour, and I had drinks along the way!  The iPad was a very nice touch as well.  Next time I come to Chicago I'll definitely sign up for another tour.
