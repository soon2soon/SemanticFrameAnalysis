Vincent was our guide and he was awesome! My family and I had never ridden on a Segway, but with Vincent's expertise and training, we were off in no time. We had signed up for the skyscraper tour, but we went all over and saw lots of sights. Vincent had great stories to tell about the history of Chicago and the sights. We had Living Social vouchers which made the trip even better because it was such a deal! I would highly recommend this company.
