Met our tour guide Amber at Lou Malnati's where we tasted some local Chicago deep dish pizza.  We followed her on a 3 hour tour to 6 other places, which were all great and interesting.  Among the items that you sample are sushi, almond butter toffee, oils and vinegars, exotic spices, macarons and pierogies.  The only thing I wasn't really that enthusiastic about was the iced tea at TeaGschwendner, probably because I am not a fan of iced tea to begin with.  The tea barista did make our stop there very interesting though. The tour itself is great, but what really made this excellent was our tour guide, Amber.  Amber really had good knowledge of the restaurants we went to, and along the way she shared with us her love for the city of Chicago and showed us points of interest, together with a short history lesson (and she made all that fun).  All in all, this is highly recommended and even more so if you happen to get Amber as your tour guide.
