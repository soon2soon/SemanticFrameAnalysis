Contacted Aries to book wedding transportation on a referral from a friend who does a lot of work with the company. Antoinette was very knowledgeable and offered helpful suggestions. She has worked many years in the industry and was more than happy to walk me through the best plan for our evening. I appreciated her expertise and efficient customer service. The shuttle service the night of the wedding went exactly as planned without incident. **Best part is that Antoinette made this all come together the WEEK OF the wedding. She immediately responded to my request for info and we worked everything out in only a few days. The planning was fast and painless and everything turned out as discussed on the wedding night. Highly recommended!
