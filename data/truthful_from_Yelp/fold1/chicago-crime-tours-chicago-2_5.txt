I booked a private tour with Chicago Crime Tours for the spouses of the work team I was with.  Mark made it so easy to set-up and handled all of the details.  He has great follow through and I never felt like I didn't know what was going on.   Our tour guide Billy was amazing!  The stories he retold to us were full of facts and interesting history.  He made it real and funny by adding his own touch, thoughts and insights.  He kept it light but it wasn't just fluff.  We started the tour as as bunch of strangers but by the end, over deep dish pizza, we were having real conversations.  I attribute that openness to Billy and how he engaged us all with the tour.   The bus was VERY nice.  Okay, it's been a long time since I've been on a "Party Bus" but when did they start making them with hardwood floors, flat screens and leather seats?  Needless to say transportation was super nice, clean and warm (this was during the polar vortex of January 2014).  Our driver was also great.  He noticed we were parked in some slush so he moved just so we could board clean.  Fun and friendly guy!   Thanks Chicago Crime Tours!
