This is an awesome tour! A must do when in Chicago! We did the Brew Bus tour last Sunday and it was definitely a great experience. Kevin was so welcoming, informative, and a great beer drinking buddy. You start at Goose Island, where the brews are unique and go down smooth (but, wait, they get harsher along the way). Then make your way to Haymarket Brewery, where the Riot Burger is a must! The staff at Haymarket is so knowledgeable and definitely has a love of great craft brews! The brewery tour is certainly an added bonus. You will leave knowing more about beer than you did when you walked in the door. Definitely a cool experience. Last stop is Moonshine. Quite frankly, this one was a blur. Just kept on drinking. Cool vibe. Much like a laid back lounge. With its over-sized couches and eclectic clientele. A good finale to the tour. Thank goodness for the transportation of the Brew Bus. Made the ride a smooth one. Check out this tour when you're in the City--you won't regret it!
