Like getting a good work out, being outside, seeing some wildlife, having fun, I highly recommend kayaking in the Chicago river. It's a nice beak from the city while your in the city. I promise you that you won't glow or get a virus from the river.....it was surprisingly clean. I haven't been on a tour so I can only recommend the kayak's. If you decide to take a tandem kayak be prepared to quarrel a little, how to paddle, not paddling hard enough, and I can feel you making those faces at me from behind (I don't know how she knew I was doing that). It's also a little harder to paddle seeing that you have twice the weight, but overall I still would recommend them. Paddling up stream obviously is the way to go but people do decide to go downstream for a different view. Really the current is not that strong so you can do either one. It does give your upper body a nice workout so it's nice to coast more down stream. The view itself is nice, greenery, some animals (I swear that duck was giving me an evil eye and wanted to tip the boat over), other friendly boaters, and marked street bridges so you know about where you are or how far you've gone. Other then the paddling I found it very relaxing and will be going back. I recommend calling to reserving a kayak or canoe, they fill up really fast. They open at 9am, I got there at 10am on a Sunday morning, I blinked and there were a bunch more people waiting. The staff is young so they are a little slow but helpful if you don't know what you're doing. I was in the water and ready to go ten min. later. What really makes this company amazing is how CHEAP they are!! $15 an hour for single kayak and canoes, $20 for tandem kayaks.
