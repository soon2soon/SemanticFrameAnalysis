Wow!  What can I say?  Thank you Yelpers for the reviews of this place!  What a gem!   The price is right and the location is a block and a half away from the Orange Line to downtown and minutes from Midway airport.  There is a free shuttle that will take you to and from the airport (Midway), restaurants, the Orange Line, the store...basically anywhere within a few miles.  We never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a ride and when we told them in advance what time we were going somewhere, they were ready and waiting.  The shuttle runs 24 hours/day. Upon check in, I verified the shuttle would take us to the Orange Line as my aunt does not walk well.  They said yes, and they mentioned they had us on the second floor of the hotel, but would move us downstairs to accommodate my aunt.  AWESOME!  They provided us a list with local restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. and highlighted staff favorites.  The staff have good taste - we tried a couple of their favorite restaurants! The free breakfast consisted of Dunkin Donut sandwiches, donuts, coffee, fruit, milk, bagels, etc.   Free wifi.  Plenty of cable channels and movie channels. Rooms were very clean and well kept.  Sufficient plugs for devices.  Dispensers for toiletries.  Microwave.  Refrigerator.  Plenty of space.  We stayed during a cold spell and the heater worked great. All staff we encountered were extremely friendly and accommodating. Will be returning to Chicago and will be staying at Carlton Inn Midway!  Wish I could take this place with me everywhere I travel!
