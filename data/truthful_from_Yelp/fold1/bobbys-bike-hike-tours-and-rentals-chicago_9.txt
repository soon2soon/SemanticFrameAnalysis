Did the Gangster tour and had a blast! DEIRDRE was our guide and did an amazing job at not only leading us over the 13ish miles of the tour, but also in the amount of knowledge she had, and the stories she told. I can't believe that she was able to wrangle a large group of 17 tourists along city streets without missing a beat or losing anyone at any time along the way. Plus, she magically kept the rain away until we finished the tour, as promised. I would definitely do this again!
