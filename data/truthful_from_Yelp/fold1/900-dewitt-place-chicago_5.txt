There are a few places that I question Yelping because they are sooo awesome that I feel greedy and want to keep them to myself. But then I have to be nice and think about the owners and how much better it would be for them to rock out running their businesses. What a world, what a world. Enter 900 DeWitt Place. Have friends or family coming from out of town? Live in the 'burbs and want to spend a night in Chicago for a play or just to get away? Care to enjoy the views of Lake Michigan without the tourist trap hotels and extra taxes and fees? This is the place. My husband, our dog and I stood here for New Years Eve and loved every single part of our stay. The quiet, vintage building is tucked away in Streeterville with hundreds of venues, restaurants, stores and parks nearby. Northwestern Memorial Hospital and RIC, as well as the MCA are all within walking distance. The studio is fully furnished, complete with dishes. Be prepared for a tiny Euro-style bathroom with tub. Juan, the Reservations Manager, was very professional and very helpful. I would highly recommend Â 900 N. DeWitt Place to anybody looking for a place to stay in Chicago at an affordable price.
