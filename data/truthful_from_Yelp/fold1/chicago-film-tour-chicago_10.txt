We had the Groupon for the Blues Brother Tour.  We have always liked the movie and moved to Chicago in October.  It was great to see all of the south side locations, but sad to see all the things that have been taken away.  Overall the tour was great.  The DVD kept freezing because of the bumps on the road.  I thought everything was well done.  I would def take my friends who are blues brothers fans on this tour.  Really enjoyed seeing the old "Ray's music shop" on 47th street.
