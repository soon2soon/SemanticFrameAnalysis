We rented a large quadcycle for 4 on a rather blustery day. However, we still managed to have fun and bike alongside the lake front to past Oak Street Beach and back.  The service was good, and rates are reasonable ($35 for an hour for 4 ppl).  The only downside was that the quadcycle was actually pretty hard to control since it was huge and pedaling for4 is such a work out - especially if not everyone's pulling their weight. I want to go back in the summer to rent a real bike or a tandem bike and be able to enjoy it in nice weather.  They also have Bike Chicago locations at N. Ave beach and Foster beach, but only offer the large quadcycles (fits up to 6 adults) at Navy Pier.
