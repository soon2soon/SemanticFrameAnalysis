We obviously hit the jackpot.....our guide was perfect for us, he and my husband both being musicians.  His name is Justin Adair and he takes great pride in his work and is such an easy person to spend the day with.  We were with him for around three ish hours, he picked up on what we were interested in and ran with it, nice!  We are also very fit so we were able to cover a lot of ground with him.  He is an extremely talented singer as well!  He sang in the tunnels to show us the acoustics, yes he can sing.  I highly recommend the tour and Justin, I can't speak for anyone else there, I think the guide is what makes the tour, along with a curious visitor.  It reminded me of when we were in Italy and how perfect all our guides were there, art historians for art tours.........
