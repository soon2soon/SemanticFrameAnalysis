We toured the city and it's beautiful architecture with Larry this past weekend and had a great time.  He has a wealth of knowledge on just about everything in the city, enjoys what he does, and we learned so much from him.  Much more fun than a cookie cutter tour you'd find from a big company for $$.  Highly recommend.
