Central Loop and Club Quarters is the same hotel! Great value for our money. Perfect location with easy on/off of multiple transportation systems. The hotel was clean and the staff was helpful. The rooms are on the smaller side, but met are our needs. We made use of the perks of the computer room w/free printing, Wi-Fi and lounge area. I would definitely recommend!
