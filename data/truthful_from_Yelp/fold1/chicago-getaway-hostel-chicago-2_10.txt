I loved my two night stay here.  In town w/ three friends for a concert.   4-bed (two bunks) private room w/ bath.  Clean and quiet! Staff was great, fellow travelers were all very pleasant and fun.  Free breakfast was more than adequate, kitchen was available if wanted. Will stay here again next time I'm in the Windy City!
