Awesome intro to Chicago.  Yeah for $22 tickets for the 90 minute tour due to our the military exchange discount.  The boat was nice with free drinks and snacks.  The tour guide has apparently been doing this for over twenty years and is clearly very passionate about architecture.  We learned all about the history of the buildings through her native eyes.  The only downside at all was I don't recall her asking us if we had any questions.  Although I'm sure she would have answered them if we asked her 1:1.  Awesome well spent money.
