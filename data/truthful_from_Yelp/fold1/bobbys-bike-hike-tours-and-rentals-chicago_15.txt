**AWESOME SOUTHSIDE GANGSTER TOUR** I practice law because I wanted to be Tom Hagen from The Godfather. So I have always been fascinated with mafia and the "underworld". This tour satisfied that fascination. TOUR INCLUDES ============== Bicycle, helmet, and guide explaining the history of the outfit and how it has transformed over the years into what it is today. 3.5 hours. BRING ====== Water. Comfortable clothes. Sandals OK. SUMMARY ========= Chicago's seedier side was unveiled on this ride through the Southside's most notorious areas, including the old Bridgeport neighborhood.  We learned about the history of the Chicago Outfit as we rolled by famous mob hangouts and homes, Chicago's old red-light district, and Al Capone's old stomping grounds.   HIGHLIGHTS ========== Bridgeport, Chinatown, hidden Palmisano Park, old Italian Outfit hangouts (where we waved and said hello to the Italian men sitting out front), The old Levee District (Chicago's Red Light district), The McCormick Place, Prairie Ave District, Museum Campus and the Lakefront.
