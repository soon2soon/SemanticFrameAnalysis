Second time taking this tour - it was nice to see the owner Jon but was bummed when he said he would not be doing the tour but his associate Jonathon was heading up the days adventure. Happy for Jon as business is going well and Jonathon (Jon) did a great Job!!   Hit 4 solid spots, learned more about the History of Chicago, Pizza in Chicago and had a great experience.  Truly worth every dollar in addition to TIPS for Will the driver and Jon the tour guide. This is an absolute MUST DO in Chicago for Locals and people visiting.  Up there with a sporting event, The Bean, Sue, The Observation Decks.   YES - there are the nay sayers who have lived in Chicago for 11 years etc... etc... like the nice gentleman who was with his family at the Bean.  After showing him the itinerary I had just completed he responded "I have never heard of those places before..."   So enough said - Book the Tour and Enjoy!!!!!   Just tell them John from CA sent ya, HA!
