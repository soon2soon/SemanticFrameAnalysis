5 stars for an overall great experience! Started out the trip with a free shuttle to and from O'hare airport. Shuttle drivers were very nice, accommodating and professional. We arrived at the hotel and was greeted with friendly staff. Our room was clean and comfortable. The housekeeping was excellent and took extra time to organize our toiletries in the bathroom. This hotel is conveniently located next to Cumberland train station. And when I mean conveniently located, I mean we walked our asses there! :) Great room service and a great gym with complimentary headphones fruits, and water to burn off all the food you ate! Thank you Chicago Marriott O'hare. If I am ever to go back to Chicago, I will definitely stay here again! :)
