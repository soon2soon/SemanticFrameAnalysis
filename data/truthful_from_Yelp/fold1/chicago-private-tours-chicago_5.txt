I hate to be repetitive,  but I cannot recommend this company highly enough.  I recently hosted six friends from Paris. One friend speaks English pretty well, but the other five speak no English. We had been at my home in La Crosse, but I wanted to show them the big city in Chicago.  I found the company through Tripadvisor, and it was absolutely perfect. Andrea, the girl who took my reservation, was extremely helpful.  Their employees, Chloe and TJ, met my group at the Museum of science and industry, took them around the city to see the highlights, and then dropped them at our meeting place at Navy Pier.  My friends could not have been happier.  Sandrine had that little two hour break from having to translate everything for the rest of the group.  Both of the adults were happy, and the four children loved all of the sites also.  This company serves an important need in Chicago, and I would be pleased to recommend them to anyone. A special thanks to Chloe, TJ, and to Andrea! ( At one point I had a concern so I called the dispatcher.  He, too, could not have been nicer. I try to get some insight into the amount that I should be tipping for the services, but he insisted that it was at the customers' own discretion.  I DO wish that there were some guideline, for I didn't know if 20% was too much or not enough, but he wouldn't help with that. I understand that my question was probably difficult to answer!)
