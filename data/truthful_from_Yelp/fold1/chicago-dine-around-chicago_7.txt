We used Chicago Dine Around for our office holiday party last Friday and absolutely had a great time!  Everything went super well.  I am always planning these events for my office and Brandon made it super easy.  You literally got picked up, driven to all the venues, walked past everyone waiting, sat down, and started to get your food!  Sooo easy.  I cannot express enough how well Brandon handled everything. He was a perfect host!  He made sure we had everything we needed and kept us on time.  Very polite and funny! He entertained us between spots with trivia and really had our group interacting.. I received the invoice by Monday morning.  No hidden surprises.  I was told by my colleagues this was by far one of their most favorite holiday parties and that is saying a LOT as they can tend to be a bit picky (a smallish office of 22 employees). Great for an employee outing!
