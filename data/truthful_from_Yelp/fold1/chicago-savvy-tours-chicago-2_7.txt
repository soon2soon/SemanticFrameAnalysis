Really enjoyed our guide ANA on the Frank Lloyd Wright Tour. She was extremely knowledgeable and well versed on Frank Lloyd Wright history. She truly cared about the subject and made everyone feel comfortable with asking any questions. She was Â the best tour guide I have ever had. Would definitely recommend this tour.
