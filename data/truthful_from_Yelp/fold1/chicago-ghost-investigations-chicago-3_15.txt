This was a great experience!  I came with 14 girls age ranging from 14-17 and they had a great time!   It was an enlightening experience. We made contact with several spirits. I was a bit skeptical at first but after this... Not anymore. I would def go back in the near future. The guides were wonderful!  The customer service was outstanding! The owner was knowledgeable and informative! Actually, some of the girls told their family members about it and they can't wait to go! Thanks Chicago Ghost Investigation for my daughters wonderful 15th birthday and an amazing experience for all of us!
