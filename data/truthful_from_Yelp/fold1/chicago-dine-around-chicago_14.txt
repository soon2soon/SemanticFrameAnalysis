Just completed a company dinner outing with Chicago Dine-Around. We had 50 people with varying tastes and opinions to please...and please we did! Thanks to Brandon and Â his team we had a FANTASTIC time with delicious food, a tour of downtown and lots of fun! Would definitely recommend you give this experience a try.
