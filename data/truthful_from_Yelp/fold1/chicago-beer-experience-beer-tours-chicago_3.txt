This was a great way to experience Chicago and learn about its history, equally so for beer. My girlfriend and I recently moved to the area and we loved the Wicker Park tour, it even came with a Chicago Hot Dog. Although the price was a little high, it's definitely worth it for all the tastings, food, and great tour guide (Neil is awesome).
