For my first time venturing in Chicago, alone with my boyfriend (without my parents), this place was perfect! To start, the rooms aren't giant, but they are definitely livable. We only stayed a weekend so for the time being we didn't need anything excessive. Don't expect anything too lavish; however, the bed was very comfortable along with the pillows. As far as the view from our hotel window goes... WOW! It was amazing. One night during our stay there was a show on the river and crowds of people surrounded the Chicago River Walk and we could see exactly what they could only 16 floors up! It was great for just a couple of days considering we didn't stay in the room that often. As a security measure, in order to use the elevator, it is necessary to insert your room key to get the the floor you would like. The whole time I was here I raved about how great the location was. It was in walking distance to the shopping malls and stores on Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, and even Navy Pier. The only downfall I would say was the price of overnight parking. We stayed two nights and it costed me $90... Yikes! If there were half stars I would give this place a 4 1/2 just for that reason but for the expectations I had going in it was great. Other than that my weekend experience staying here was wonderful and I don't doubt that I will stay here again.
