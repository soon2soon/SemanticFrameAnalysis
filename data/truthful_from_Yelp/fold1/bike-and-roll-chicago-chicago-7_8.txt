I wanted to save this business from a bad review because this company is great!  I don't have any experience with rentals, however Dan (my man) at the Milleniumn Park location in repairs is extremely qualified and not a jerk like most all I have run into down here since moving in from the burbs.  I have literally gone thru five shops and found the staff and or mechanics to be mostly arrogant and some not even qualified.  Dan at Bike Chicago is friendly and shows you what he is doing and why he is doing it to repair your bike.  I am not someone with an expensive bike.  I have a Giant comfort bike and I ride alot in all weather.  Most bike shops I have encountered down here don't really want to deal with anyone that isn't into an expensive road bike, a fixie or a messenger.  Dan has a road bike and obviously is a bike guy.  The thing he doesn't have and the reason I have and will have all of my repairs done with him is because he doesn't have a stupid attitude.  Great work at a great price and a really good employee to represent the company.
