Had a great experience with Chicago Detours and our tour guide Elizabeth! It's a nice and long tour but you don't have to walk to far to see all of these things that you might just pass every day on your way to work. The implementation of the video clips and photos throughout the tour was a great way to tie in what we were seeing in front of us and then the history behind it in the photos or videos. Elizabeth did an amazing job not only giving us a nice history lesson, she made it super enjoyable and made the 2 hours fly by. I would recommend it for all kinds of people, whether its your first time in Chicago or you've lived here your entire life.
