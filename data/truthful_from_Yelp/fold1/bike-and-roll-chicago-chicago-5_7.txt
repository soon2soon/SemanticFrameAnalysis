We have done segway tours before and it is a great way to show our friends the city and Â learn new things. Our tour guide was TESS, and she was AMAZING! We covered a lot of ground and had great information about Chicago Architechture. We took some awesome pictures too! The tours that we had taken close to Navy Pier were no where nearly as good. I would do it again in a heartbeat at Bike and Roll.
