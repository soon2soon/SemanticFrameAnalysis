I spent two night here over the holiday weekend of 4th of July. I reserved my room through orbitz which saved me some major $$$. That being said, I definitely got a great bang for my buck. The location is prime for anyone looking to enjoy the river north night life. The rooms are a little tight but exceptionally clean and with a sleek contemporary design. The staff from top to bottom were extremely polite and prompt with all my requests including an early check in for myself and my other buddies who booked separate rooms too. Over night parking is $60/night valet and $45/night self park. I'm trying to think of some flaws but I can't really think of any. They are still very new so I am hoping they maintain this great level of hospitality, cleanliness and great service which is all I really need.
