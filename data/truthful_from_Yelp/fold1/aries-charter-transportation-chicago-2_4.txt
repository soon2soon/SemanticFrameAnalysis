we used Aries Charter for our wedding transportation. Our ceremony was in the city and our reception was in the burbs. Half of our guests were from Ohio, and we didn't want any of them getting lost or having a bad experience while driving, so hiring transportation for them to get to the ceremony and back to the reception was a priority for us. We researched several companies, and Aries had the best prices and a nice fleet of vehicles, so we hired them. We wanted them to take a scenic route through the city so our guests could see a little bit of beautiful Chicago, and they had no problem accomodating our request. The bus was on time, clean and the driver was very professional. Our guests were so appreciative of the comfort and ease of getting to and from the ceremony in the city. It was one of the best things we spent money on for our wedding. Thanks, Aries!
