"If it's free, it's for me!" For this reason, & the great Yelp reviews, I decided to check this out. I'm somewhat new to the area, so I wasn't really sure of what to plan for my family's upcoming visit. With Chicago having so much to offer, I thought this sounded like the perfect way to kick things off. When you schedule a tour through the website, you fill out a short survey. It's filled with questions about what your interested in getting out of the tour. How amazing, right? Not only do you get your own personal tour guide, but they cater the tour to your own personal interests! I definitely recommend this to Â anyone interested in learning more about the area. I wish more cities offered this program!
