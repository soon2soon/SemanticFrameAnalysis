I bought the Chicago Beer Experience for my boyfriend for xmas, and boy am I glad I did! We had a blast from start to finish. Neal/Neil was a great guide -- friendly and quite knowledgeable about Chicago history and the beer we tried during the Wicker Park Beer Tour. Best of all is all the great people we met on the tour -- such fun people who mingled among the group as opposed to keeping to themselves. I expected small tastes of beer, but was pleasantly surprised with how generous the pours were. Not only would I highly recommend it, but I just might do the tour again!
