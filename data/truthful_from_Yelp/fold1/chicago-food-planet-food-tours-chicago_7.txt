As a newbie to Chicago take the Bucktown/Wicker Park and this will be the BEST money you will ever spend....screw that Willis Tower! Ok, fine, go there too. 5 Food Tour Survival Tips: 1. Take the 11 AM tour with less people. 2. Don't eat anything before your tour. 3. Don't bother eating anything on the tour you don't love (I HATED the Chicago dog, but ate it bc it was the first thing on the tour and regretted it so bad by stop 3). 4. Wear comfy shoes bc although you are not running a 5k, there is a ton of walking.. 5. Pray to the God's for good weather. This was an awesome tour in a town where food is part of the culture, even for non-foodies. Our guide was a rockstar and super fun and we came in the winter of polar vortex, so I can imagine it is twice as fun with warmer weather.
