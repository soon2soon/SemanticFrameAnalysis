I'll admit... I was five minutes inside the doors of the Marriott ready to write a 3 star review.  The 4pm check in time seems especially brutal for when you come in early and you're tired.  Also, the $14.95 per day for internet seems like nickel and diming.  Please just roll it into the room charge... That said, five nights here while my sister was participating in a conference and I am won over.  The service is stellar and well thought out.  There is a desk up front that will check your bags so you can go explore while you wait to check in (excellent service and smiles from Pedro), there is free wireless in the comfy lounge with no pressure to buy anything (until it turns into more of a bar area after 4pm) while you wait.  You can't even approach the front desk without someone seeing you, smiling and start to walk towards you to see how they can help. Knowing my sister probably got herself a conference room rate with a steep discount - I was surprised we were still treated so attentively.  Our room was gorgeous (26th floor) with a partial view of the Lake and stunning views of the sky.  We opted out of room cleaning until the end to do our part for the planet but every day I would peek out from our room to see if the cleaning cart was around so I could grab some iextra coffee.  Zola the cleaning woman always greeted me with a warm hello, and "What can I help you with?" There doing everything right here.
