What a great experience! We did the 5K Grant Park run and it was a blast. I'm not the best runner (VERY SLOW) but still was able to keep up and enjoy the day. I can't wait to participate in their other tours (and maybe one day do the 26.2 tour!). Â They best part is they take pictures of you throughout the run and provide you the tour details following the run (and pictures) for free! Thank you Marlin and Michael!
