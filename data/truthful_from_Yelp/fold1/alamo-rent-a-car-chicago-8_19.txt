The minute I walked in the door, the manager Jeremy directed me immediately to the next available agent, Jackie. Â Jackie was fast and efficient while maintaining a positive and helpful attitude. The entire process to pick up my car took, maybe 5 minutes. There is nothing better than quality in a timely manner! Thanks for the pleasant experience and I will definitely be using Alamo upon my return to the Windy City!
