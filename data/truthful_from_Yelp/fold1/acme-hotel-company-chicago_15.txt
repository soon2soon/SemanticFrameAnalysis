This ain't no cookie cutter corporate hotel.  Coolest room I've ever stayed in. Check out these pics.  Excellent service, perfect location, wonderful bar and coffee/crepe bakery attached. Free morning coffee delivery.  Comfy beds. Free wifi. Jacuzzi, spa, fitness room are all clean and kitschy. Great place to book groups. I met some people at the bar area who were here on location shooting for months staying at this hotel and are loving it.  If some Hollywood peeps love it here after months, I think that speaks highly for the quality.
