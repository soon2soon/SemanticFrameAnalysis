The old man and I rented one of the boats for my little girl's 4th Birthday. She had been dying to go on a boat for the longest time as we commute down LSD daily. I missed the groupon deal so paid the full price $150 for one hour. Our reservation was for 11am and we were told to arrive 20 minutes early for orientation. We actually got there a little after 10 and were allowed to head out as soon as we finished orientation. After getting my little one securely in a life jacket we were on our way. The staff was all very nice and accommodating. They let us take one of the 'concierge' boats because it was my daughter's Birthday. It's a little nicer, tan seats instead of the standard blue and wood-looking table tops as opposed to the white plastic. All in all we had a great time. The boat was easy enough to drive that my daughter got to sit on her dad's lap and steer. Customer service was great and friendly. We got some great photos. Will definitely do it again.
