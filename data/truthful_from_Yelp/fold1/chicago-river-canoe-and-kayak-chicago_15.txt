I've done the moonlight dinner paddles twice and will go again next year.  They are organized, the dinner is fabulous, fun is had by all, and the price is totally right.   People are afraid of the river...and maybe rightfully so, but neither time did anyone fall in or even come really close.  You do get some wet...but that's what skin is for..to keep bad germs out! It's a great workout, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who was completely out of shape.  I'm no jock at all and it was difficult, but I wasn't unhappy at the end.  I felt like I had a tremendous experience and a healthy one at that.  It's made me seriously consider buying a kayak for myself :-) Oh, I see here I'm supposed to say if it's good for kids...they have single kayaks, double kayaks and canoes.  I think kids in a canoe are a fine plan...but maybe not their own kayak if it's their first time..but what do I know.
