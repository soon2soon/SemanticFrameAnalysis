Affinia is a really nice hotel.  It is super clean and nicely decorated.  The staff is very friendly.  They greeted us by our names every time we came in or left.  The rooftop bar was a little disappointing.  It's long and narrow and you can hear everyone's conversations.  It looked like it would be nice in the summer when the outdoor area is open though.  The hotel is in walking distance of lots of restaruants/bars/shopping.  It was very convenient.  They also allow dogs for no fee.   The only down side is that parking is ridiculously expensive.
