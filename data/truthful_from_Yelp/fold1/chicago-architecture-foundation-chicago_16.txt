I took two walking tours - Intersections: Chicago Old and New, and Treasures of Art and Culture. The tour guides were incredibly knowledgeable about Chicago's architecture and history. They pointed out so many details that I never would have noticed by myself. I also found they were so proud of their city and made us feel excited about the city too.
