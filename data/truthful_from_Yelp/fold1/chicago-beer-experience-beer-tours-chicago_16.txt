I recently arranged a private tour in Bucktown/Wicker Park as part of my sister's bachelorette weekend festivities. Half of the participants were local and half were from out of town. I was worried that the tour would be too touristy for us locals or too uninteresting for those who don't live in Chicago and might not appreciate its history. Â But this wasn't the case at all! Todd, our tour guide, was awesome. Off the bat, he got to know a little about each of us and our beer preferences, and seemed to base his approach off of this knowledge. It felt very personal. Todd also struck the perfect balance between education and fun. By the end, we were hugging! I thought a tour like this might be light on the beer, but that wasn't the case at all. Come prepared to drink!
