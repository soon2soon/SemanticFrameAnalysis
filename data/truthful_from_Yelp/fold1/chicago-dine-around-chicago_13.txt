I am a resident of Chicago, and often have friends visit from out of town. Several months ago, friends came in from New York and my wife and I decided to try Chicago Dine Around. At first, we were skeptical and thought that we would go to large, "touristy", chain-type restaurants; however, our skepticism was completely wrong. On the tour, we visited three restaurants that represent a cross-section of several Chicago neighborhoods. These restaurants were places that my wife and I would totally go to on our own. The first restaurant - for the appetizer course - was a really great Italian place. Don't be fooled - the appetizer course on this tour could be a meal onto itself! Not to mention that this place offers unlimited wine. We were fortunate to sit at a table with several older women that were in Chicago for a reunion. We had a blast with the people that we met on our tour, all lubricated by drinking many, many glasses of wine. The second restaurant was a Mediterranean restaurant. Here, we were served a chicken breast that was literally the size of a whole, small chicken. I don't typically order chicken since I can make it at home, but this was the most juicy and flavorful chicken that I have ever eaten. Really, really good. For the final course, we went to a French restaurant. It's difficult to describe exactly what we had, but suffice it to say that it was a giant chocolate cake-type thing that oozed and goo'ed it way into our mouths. OUTSTANDING!!! In summary: Chicago Dine Around is a wonderful and unique dining experience for both Chicagoans and those visiting the city. Our tour was so great that we took visiting family on the tour this past weekend. I highly recommend this tour. And, as a bonus the tour guide provides information on all the neighborhoods, and I learned things about my city hat I didn't know before... Very cool!
