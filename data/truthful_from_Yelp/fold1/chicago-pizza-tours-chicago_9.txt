We went on the afternoon tour as part of a bachelorette party, and had a blast! The tour owner I'm pretty sure knows EVERYTHING there is to know about pizza and pizza in Chicago, which I like geeking out about and learning. On the tour, you get to visit 4 places, which all had different styles of pizza to enjoy- coal fired, deep dish, thin crust, stuffed... you get one to two slices per place which is filling, but still allows you to keep on going at the next place! You get education during the bus ride, and get to see different ovens at some of the places. It's a nice chance to see some of the neighborhoods in the city too. I would highly recommend this to anyone- tourist or local!
