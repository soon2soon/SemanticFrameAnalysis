What a find! Right across from the Chicago Art Institute, this little jem is not the type of gift store that tourists are likely to enter to buy Chicago-themed souvenirs. However, they do have many unique and creative souvenirs, some related to Chicago's architecture and some not. There were a few Frank Lloyd Wright items and posters that I would have bought if only I had the money! Worth the visit if you are visiting!
