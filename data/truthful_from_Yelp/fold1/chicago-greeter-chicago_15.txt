Outstanding program that is actually FREE.  Totally unbelievable! I found this while doing research on TripAdvisor and other sites and saw that this was a volunteer program where locals gave up their time to show visitors parts of Chicago that they were experts in.  I noted that I wanted to learn about the Chicago Fire, street food and architecture/skyline, which is exactly what we got with our greeter. We met up with our greeter at the Cultural Center.  It was a rainy day which really got us down but our greeter was gung-ho about showing us around.  We navigated the transit system with him and he showed us what we wanted to see.  Tours generally can last up to 4 hours; our greeter had suggested showing us northern Chicago suburbs (where he lives) but we were also headed towards the Museum of Science and Industry so it would've been out of our way.  We spent approximately 2 hours with our greeter touring the market, as well as chatting about Chicago history. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with our greeter and would definitely recommend this service to any visitors.  I am told that there are greeter programs in a lot of the big cities in US and wish I had known about it when we went to New Orleans!
