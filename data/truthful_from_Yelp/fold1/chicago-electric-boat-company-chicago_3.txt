Had an awesome time last week putzing around on the Chicago River in a Duffy Boat.  What an awesome experience all around! Our group brought wine, snacks and sandwiches and had the boat for 2 hours which was plenty to get us to Chinatown and back.  It was pretty simple to drive - the boat doesnt go much faster than 5 mph so you just need to be aware of the traffic such as Water Taxis and tourist tours.  They say these boats seat up to 10, but as others have stated 7, maybe 8, is perfect - 10 may have been a bit cramped.  The boat also has a cable to hook up your iPhone to the radio.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and a breeze to work with. HIGHLY recommend Chicago Electric Boat Company for a fun and unique Chicago experience.
