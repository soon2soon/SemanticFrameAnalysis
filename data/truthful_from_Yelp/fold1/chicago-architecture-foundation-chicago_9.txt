We did NOT take a river cruise, so I'm in the minority here. The name of our 2-hour walking tour was "South Loop: Rise of the Skyscraper." If you're looking for an active tourist outing, this is just about perfect. When I say "active," I mean it. We were on the move almost the whole time, and at a brisk clip. (And this is from a New Yorker who is used to speed-walking everywhere.) There's a lot of ground to cover, both physically and intellectually. We're talking engineering, architecture, and design of some of the most spectacular, innovative buildings in the world. Our docent was first-rate, easily able to rattle off facts, tell a good story, and answer some oddball questions. The only drawback was that we could not gain entry to all the buildings, as it was a holiday weekend. I really wish we had known that in advance. Sometimes, we got lucky and could enter even though the buildings were not technically open, but sometimes we were out of luck. (Had to go back the next day to see the interior of the historic Rookery.) An excellent introduction to Chicago and its history.
