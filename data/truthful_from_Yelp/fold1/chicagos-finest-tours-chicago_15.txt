We did the Pedway tour and found it fun, engaging, and entertaining along the way. The tour guide was great and he told us fun facts about the city and Chicago's sports teams. He also quizzed us to win a prize and had treats for us along the way. We highly recommend this tour for anyone new to the city or anyone who's not familiar with the Pedway system. Great pace and overall a great tour!
