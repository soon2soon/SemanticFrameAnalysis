In short - take this tour!  My tour guide was Roberta and she did a superb job.  I was so glad to have been with her because she was both professional and laid back at the same time.  There was a lot of attention paid to safety, but a real emphasis on the many wonderful sights to see along the lakefront, including the skyline architecture.  I live in Chicago and have seen much of the lakefront, museum campus, Grant Park, Millennium Park, Soldier Field, etc, but Roberta provided plenty of new information and took us to new places I wasn't familiar with.  We had ample time for individual instruction at the beginning, and then we were off.  It never felt rushed or hurried.  There was plenty of time to see the sights, zip along on the segways where the crowds were thin, ask questions, even time for snack breaks and bathroom breaks.  I've done three lakefront segway tours in the past four years and this was the best.  Thank you Roberta for being such a good guide and thank you Bike and Roll!
