This was an AWESOME pizza tour. John, our tour guide, was funny, knowledgeable, and friendly. He remembered all our names, and where we were from, and even that it was my husband and I's 1-year anniversary (what better way to celebrate than with pizza glory?!?!)...a surprising feat since I can't even remember my mother's birthday date. Anyway, I digress. As a NYer, I was pretty skeptical since we have awesome pizza. I was proven wrong. We met at Pizano's in the Loop (just a few blocks from "the bean"...or, the real name, Cloud Gate). Don't worry, I will not be giving away any of the super fun secrets John has about the places. But I will have to say, you get a TON TON TON of appreciation of each of the pizza places after understanding the ingredients, recipe, and how the pizzeria got started. Pizano's was my favorite. We tried a deep dish and thin-crust tastings. Pepperoni thin-crust! We then went to: Coalfire pizza, Pequod's, and Pizzeria Da Nella Cucina Napolentana. All were VERY different pizzas, which my hubby and I appreciated because eating 4 deep-dishes in a row would probably become painful and even monotonous. Coalfire was a crisper thin crust (since it uses coal for the heat), Pequod's was your standard deep dish glory, and Nella's was a wood-fire pizza (thin crust but had the consistency of naan bread since the moisture from the wood.). Nella's pizza is awesome. My 2nd favorite pie, and my hubby's 1st favorite. So seriously folks, go on the pizza tour. It is about 3-hours and simply so much fun. John is awesome and a true foodie enthusiast. He will teach you all about the pizzas, as well as some fun Chi-town information as the bus drives you from one location to the next. Be prepared to be ridiculously full afterwards. My husband and I went to one of the beaches right afterwards and felt shameful with our food baby bellies.
