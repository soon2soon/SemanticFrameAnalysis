Greatest value for the money.  We arrived around 1:30 pm to drop off our luggages while we walk around until 3pm check in.  Instead we were greeted by super nice front stuff who  gave us a room immediately.  When we opened our door came the next surprise.   Soooo clean!  Nicely appointed and spacious.  Linen and toilettery  can be mistaken for a higher class hotels.   We did not have a car to take advantage of free parking in downtown, but we did take advantage of free printer service.  We did not have time to look, but there is indoor pool and gym.  Stuff is polite and very helpful. We have stayed in Best Western only once many years ago and it was okay, but this is a whole new level.  I plan to book BW for the next trip wherever it may be to see if this is BW standard now.  If so, I will stay at BW everywhere .
