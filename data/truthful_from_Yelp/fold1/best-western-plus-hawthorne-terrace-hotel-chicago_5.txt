What a find. Moved to Chicago from Baltimore. Needed a place to stay near a new apartment while I fixed it up. Great staff. Good rooms for the price. Found out I couldn't get points through Expedia...so they helped me cancel out and rebook through BW, which they didn't have to do. Rates more than reasonable, though they really jump on weekends. Had an attitude about Best Western that proved to be dead wrong. Gained weight from the Ann Sathers cinnamon buns. Damn!
