I've stayed here three times - twice with kids and once as a couple.  Always nice rooms at a great price.  When we stayed with the kids we got connecting rooms and they were fun and spacious.  Love having Beatrix downstairs for breakfast in the morning and cocktails for happy hour.  Very conveniently located in River North. The lobby can get crowded and loud but it never bothers me.  Front desk is friendly but sometimes you have to wait a few minutes to get their attention.  Would definitely stay again.
