I'm on a Yelp updating roll lately! After not hearing back from this company about using them for my wedding day I tasked my fiance with booking a different limo service.  He found a Groupon or something and found a place that would give us a limo for the day (it was only about a month away).  At 6pm on the day of the booking, this limo company called him and took down his credit card info.  At 7pm that day I was contacted by the Chicago Brew Bus company saying they were so sorry about missing my emails.  They offered to let me use them for free if we hadn't already made other arrangements.  We were able to get out of the other reservations and the Brew Bus was extremely responsive and generous with us about making the arrangements.   I was able to get in touch directly with the driver so that we could discuss routes for picture taking and everything seemed to be in order.  The day before my wedding (after not being able to pick up my dress, another review altogether) I got an email that the bus I was supposed to be using was actually in the shop.  After hyperventilating for a minute I read the entire email and discovered that they had made arrangements for a bigger, better bus at another company for my use.  Now, the driving around on the big day didn't go perfectly since he didn't know my route, but that isn't their fault. The point is, the Chicago Brew Bus company stepped up, went above and beyond to make a bride happy, and have earned a customer for life.  I had no plans to book a party bus for anything in the future, but now I'll make the point to do so just so that I can show them my true appreciation for what they did for me.
