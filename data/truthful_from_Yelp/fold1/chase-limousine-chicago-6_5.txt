My husband uses Chase sedan service for work and loves them.  After using several other companies that were more expensive but less reliable, it was refreshing to find Chase Limo.    The drivers are extremely reliable; often showing up 20-30minutes early.  Their whole fleet of cars are in tip top shape and clean.   Where other companies say they charge $55 from midway to downtown, but then throw on other fees and exceptions, Chase limo is truly $55 plus tip (extremely reasonable for level of service that they offer)   Also, they have a website that allows you to schedule pickups and drop offs and friendly dedicated phone service as well.   If you are looking for dependable transportation without price gimmicks, give them a call!
