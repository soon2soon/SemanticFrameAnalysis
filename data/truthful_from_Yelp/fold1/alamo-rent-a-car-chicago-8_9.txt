The Alamo bus driver who took us from ORD to the rental site was practically a tour guide.  I'm from Chicago so I smiled when he told this tourist to go to Portillos.  He was very cool.   We went to the kiosk because the line was long.  We had a rez and I was finished checking in less than 5 minutes.  The manager told me that I could take a mid size SUV at no extra charge for my weekend rental.  Very cool. The Dodge Journey we took had less than a 1000 miles.  It was great. Check in was a snap.
