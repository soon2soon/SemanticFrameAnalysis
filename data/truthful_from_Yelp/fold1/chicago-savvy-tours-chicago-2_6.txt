George was our tour guide on the FLW walking tour.  He was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and precise.  I would love to have him give FLW tours locally in California as well during the cold Chicago winters.  A great vacation for him, and a terrific resource for us! Many thanks for the educational afternoon!
