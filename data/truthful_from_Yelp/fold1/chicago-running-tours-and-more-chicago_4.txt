My girlfriend and I are both from Chicago, and we enjoy touring our city, but this time we wanted to do it in a different way, so we signed up for a Tragic Event running tour. When we got to meet our tour guide, Marlin, we found out we were the only people doing the tour that day! We were shocked, surprised to hear that the tour runs even if only one person signs up, and we were thrilled and excited that because of that we were basically getting our own private tour. Marlin has a great personality and he really just goes along with your pace; he was also very knowledgeable in little obscure facts about the city, and really helpful in providing additional tips for dining and other tour experiences. My girlfriend and I had a blast with all the pictures Marlin was taking for us, and it was really awesome to hear that part of the money also goes out to help a good cause. My girlfriend and I really look forward to signing up to another of his tours. It's really a one of a kind experience and Marlin goes out of his way to make sure everyone enjoys it!
