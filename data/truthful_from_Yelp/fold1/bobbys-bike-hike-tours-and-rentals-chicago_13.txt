The Holiday Tour was fantastic!  Our tour guide Gabe was energetic and knowledgeable about the City.  We started at the Cultural Center and ended at a charming pub where we ate delicious bratwursts and enjoyed flights of local Chicago beer. My husband and I learned a lot of fun details about the city.  This tour was awesome and we will be back for Bikes and Brews next time we are in Chicago!
