Super informative. Entertaining. Enlightening. So happy I took a friend's advice to take the river tour. If you're visiting, I recommend doing this before anything else. Gives you awesome context for the buildings you'll see while walking around and otherwise getting around the city. Our docent was knowledgeable, funny and, as an older gentleman, had great stories about how much Chicago had changed over the years.
