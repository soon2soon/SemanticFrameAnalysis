Cathy was a fantastic host for our hour tour. She made it magical for our four year old who thought she was a princess. Cathy was friendly, knowledgeable and fun. Â She even recommended a great family restaurant for us after our tour, took our photos and let my daughter pet the horse. :) For those of you who are talking about over worked, depressed horses... it just happened to come up in our conversation about our horse that she and the other horses spend three weeks in pasture in a farm and then work one and a half weeks before returning to the country. And they have days off in between. So I doubt they are depressed. I'd love to have their vacation to work ratio! We will be doing this again next time we have guests or a special event and I will be asking for Cathy.
