We took the Segway Tour -Hyde Park. Our guide was Dave. He was fantastic and made sure all of us were safe and comfortable. He was also very entertaining!!! Plenty of side stories about the neighborhood. Extremely knowledgable about the geography & the history of the area. He also managed to get a quick peek of the President's home. Really cool!!!
