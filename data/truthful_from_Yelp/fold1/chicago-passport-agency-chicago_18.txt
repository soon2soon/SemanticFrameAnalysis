Best. Government. Office. Ever. I have never had such an easy experience. There was a short wait, they were efficient, and I got my passport the same day! If you're going for same-day passport services be prepared to wait a few hours but the wait is totally worth it! The staff was polite and accommodating. I've read some complaints about the security guards however we had nothing but smiles from the security that was there today. The whole government should run this way.
