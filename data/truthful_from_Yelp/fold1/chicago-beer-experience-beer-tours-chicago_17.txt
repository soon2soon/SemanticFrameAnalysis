JEN is exceptionally awesome!!  Did Lakeview / Lincoln Park Tour on a Sunday with her as our guide and we were thoroughly impressed!  Enthusiastic, passionate, and SO knowledgeable about the beer industry and its history in Chicago.  I recommend this tour to avid beer drinkers, beer novices, and everyone in between.  Perfect amount of walking and great locations.  So enjoyable!!!
