I had a friend visiting Chicago and was persuaded into taking her on a historical architecture tour on the lake. I was hesitant at first since she's not a history buff, but all the skepticism melted away after getting on the boat. The staff was amazing and our tour guide customized the narrative to engage us. Plus, you can't beat the views of the city from the lake. I would recommend the cocktail cruise; it starts in the river and goes into the lake. Plus, light snacks are included with your ticket. Even if you're a Chicago native, grab some friends and give it a shot. It's worth it.
