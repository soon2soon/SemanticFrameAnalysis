I love this hotel! I've stayed here twice for business and the rate and quality can't be beat. The location is perfect with some rooms overlooking the river (hence the name). Free bottled water, kiosk check in/out and a really fabulous restaurant make this my go-to hotel in Chicago. The staff is helpful, friendly and accommodating. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough!
