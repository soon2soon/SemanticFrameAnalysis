Oh Robert... my trip would not have been the same without you. On our first date in Chicago our first stop was Giordano's for my first deep dish experience. Sadly, I was disappointed, my NY slices will always hold a special spot in my tummy. After that we picked up some alcohol at Uncork it and went for a scenic ride along the lakefront to see some baby belugas at the Aquarium singing. The belugas are so cute! I still can't stop humming... "Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea Swim so wild and you swim so free Heaven above and the sea below And a little white whale on the go" After the Aquarium we went for a ride around the Field's museum and Soldier Field. The weather was gorgeous, we laid out on the grass for a bit and enjoyed the clear blue sky before continuing our date to the Bean. The Bean was packed with tourists but it was worth the trek to see cutest old man dressed as Superman taking pictures with everyone. Â Next stop - Garrett's for some Chicago mix popcorn. We rode down Michigan road to try some Chicago style hot dog and italian beef at Portillo's before ending the night. I was sad to leave Robert but all good things must come to an end.. We hit a few small bumps along the way but got back up and fought through them. I will always remember the memories we shared along the water, looking out at the clear blue sky and beautiful city view. Even though we only spent 8 hours together, that 8 hours was all I needed. After riding Robert around all day, I can't wait to get a bike of my own! Thank you Robert for showing me everything Chicago had to offer. In case you didn't get it, my date was with Robert, the bike. I think it's super cute that each bike is personalized with a name :) A full day rental which came out to about $38 with tax which also includes a lock and a free helmet.
