What a great idea.  We had just 2 nights in Chicago and wanted to see (and eat) as much as possible.  Chicago Dine Around brought us to 3 cool spots, allowing us to experience more than we could have on our own.  Although I was concerned about the logistics at first, it turned out to be a non-issue.  Everything flowed smoothly and the timing at each restaurant was perfect.  I highly recommend this to anyone short on time and wanting to experience Chicago fine dining.
