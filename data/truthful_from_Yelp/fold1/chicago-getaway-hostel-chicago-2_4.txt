One of the best hostels I've stayed. It's a bit walk from the station, but definitely worth walking considering the price. It's clean, bright, and reasonable. Quiet neighborhood, unlike many hostels in big cities, which I especially liked. I stayed in a private room, and it had everything I needed.
