I went on this because (I suspect like most new businesses) a friend of a friend knows Chris, who is one of the tour guides.  I'm really glad I went, and I'm sure that this tour is going to grow quickly. The day starts out at Goose Island, but you quickly pack up to Moonshine (not my favorite), and get with one of their eight beer sampler flights (they're wee beers, probably about the size of orange juice you'd give a little kid).  Then the bus takes you to Haymarket, which is an awesome bar with a really enthusiastic brewmaster (and sweet potato tatertots-if you order them when you come in the door you'll have plenty of time to enjoy them before you leave), and another six beers.  The ride home to Goose Island is pretty darn enjoyable, and the history given by Kevin has a nice smattering of enthusiastic Chicago pride and enough random tidbits thrown in to keep you interested.  There's another flight waiting for you at Goose, where you can sit around and sober up before taking yourself home (hopefully by public transit)(or calling your Mom to come pick you up). I'd recommend this for any group of people, or just a way to get to see Chicago on a weekend day.
