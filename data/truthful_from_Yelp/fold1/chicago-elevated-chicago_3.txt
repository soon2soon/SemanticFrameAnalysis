We took the Heavy Duty Winter Tour..... complete with heated coats and a fantastic guide in Margaret.  We are actually local to Chicago and still learned new things and saw things from a different perspective.   We had such a great time.  I will definitely take friends from out of town on this and any of the other Elevated Tours.... FUN!!!
