When I first heard about this I was like "they're going to make TOURISTS bike in a CITY with busy streets? Madness." Normally urban biking is actually one of the most dangerous activities in the world for normal people, even more dangerous than driving, but somehow they were able to pull it off. They have lots of safeguards and precautions in place, such as dual volunteers wearing reflective vests in the back, tourguide taking the left-most position, and a "train" system that takes up the whole lane and blocks cars from passing (a necessary evil for safety reasons). Your kids will be safe as long as they know how to bike and follow directions. Also, tours and history usually bore me, but EDDIE had such a funny and charismatic personality that I was entertained throughout.
