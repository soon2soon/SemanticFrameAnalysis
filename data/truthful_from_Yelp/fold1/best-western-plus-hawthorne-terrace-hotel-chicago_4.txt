Stayed for 3 nights recently.  When I walked into the room my reaction was" wow". Huge room. A little suite actually with a king bed and kitchenette with a dishwasher and 2 burner stove.  Lots of Windows with plantation shutters. Spacious modern bathroom with big shower that had a rain type shower head. Aside from when the Lakeview East arts festival was going on it was quiet. Great Boystown location close to bars and restaurants.  10 minute walk to Belmont L station on Red Line and a 20 minute ride to the Loop. Decent breakfast each morning with waffles eggs and sausage or bacon. The bed was a bit hard for my taste and the tv didn't work too well. But all in all fantastic. I would definitely stay here again.
