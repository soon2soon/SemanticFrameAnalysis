I wish more people knew about this service. The volunteers do an amazing job! I have been on the Hyde Park tour with my mother and we had the absolute best time! She still mentions little tidbits about what we heard and saw. It was a really fun (and free!) afternoon. I also have used the Instagreeter service to walk around downtown. Not as heavy on the history as CAF, which can be a good thing sometimes(I can say this because I have a BA in History!). I had a great time walking around downtown and seeing some details I never would have noticed otherwise. These tours really are informative, fun and more relaxed than the other (not free) tours. You learn a lot and walk away with a smile on your face. What could be better than that?
