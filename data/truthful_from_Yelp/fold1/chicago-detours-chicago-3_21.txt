What a wonderful and unique tour!  Michael, our guide, was a wealth of interesting information as well as an excleent speaker.  Loved the history, architecture and inside stories.  One of the many highlights was the visit to the Methodist Church across from the Daley Center.  What a hidden gem. I have been telling eveyone I have seen, even strangers on the train, since the tour about this excellent tour.  We look forward to future Detour tours.
