Had a great tour with my mom today. We had Rick, and he was great. I learned so much and I LOVED the Chicago Cultural Center. I would definitely recommend the pedway walking tour to anyone who wants to learn more about Chicago's history. You may think you have a good idea, but there's was still so much to learn.
