Awesome! I like that this place is close to the lake, the water tower area, Gold Coast. And it is up front with what it offers. I've stayed here twice and have been very happy. Ok the bathroom is small. Reminds me of the bathrooms in our Rome hotel. The shower and toliet are clean, though. Don't waste your towels, unless you've opted for room service. But seriously, save some water and hang the towels up. The bed is comfy and there is a sofa bed, also. The location is great, staff great, and loction and price. The building is older, but has charm.
