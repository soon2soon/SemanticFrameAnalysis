I really enjoyed my stay at the CLoop. The girlfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and it was a blast as we made full use of the amenities. BROTIPS: -- Other reviewers talk about small rooms: Meh. I travel in Japan quite a bit, so I am used to rooms where you can touch both ends of the walls at once (I am 5'5) Compared to that, these rooms fit the girl and I rather comfortably. -- Keurig in da room, which was easy to use and convenient -- Everything was nice and clean in the room, no weirdness -- only noise came from the hallways when drunk people sauntered into their rooms --Gym is actually pretty baller for a hotel with elliptical, treadmills,bike, free weights, med balls, and two benches -- FREE UNLIMITED SNACKS Mon-Fri!!!! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANNSS??? FREE coke and sierra mist, m&ms, wasabi peas, peanuts, fruit, olives, seeds,and cookies all next to a latte machine!!!!! -- Free bottled water on most floors --Great service -- ample security (to go anywhere, you need your room card) But best of all is this place's location. If you did the city pass like me, then you do not need to take public transportation anywhere, as all the attractions are within walking distance. 10 mins from millennium park and the art museum, 5 mins to the WIllis tower, and 20 minutesto the Shedd aquarium and Field museum. All of this for a Chicago Cheap price??? Heck Ya! I will be back
