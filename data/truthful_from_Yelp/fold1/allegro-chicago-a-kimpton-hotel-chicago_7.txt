We stayed here a few weeks ago and it's been under renovation. We were a tad disappointed in some of the challenges caused by the construction so we followed up with the staff and they (like always in Kimpton style) were perfect. If you don't know this brand yet - you need it in your life. They rock my world and when I need accommodations I go Kimpton.
