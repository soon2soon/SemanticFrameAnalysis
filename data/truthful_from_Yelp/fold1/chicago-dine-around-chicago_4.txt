Brandon and his team did a sterling job, from our initial inquiry, on the day and post-event. Both Brandon and our guide, Bonnie, checked in with us during dinner to make sure everything was ok with the food and Bonnie's knowledge of Chicago and entertainment on the coach was great! I cannot recommend this service enough. From pickup to our show, we were looked after and had all the logistics taken care of. (This was an office Holiday Party for a group of around 20)
