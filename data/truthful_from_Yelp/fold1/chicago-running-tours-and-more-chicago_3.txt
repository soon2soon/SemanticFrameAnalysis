I was searching on Yelp for things to do on a recent visit to Chicago and stumbled upon Chicago Running Tours & more.  Needless to say I was excited.  I love to eat delicious food on vacation and do a ton of sightseeing, however don't ever feel like I have enough time to be active while doing everything else!  This was the perfect combination allowing me to be active and see tons of great sites!  I immediately called to book a tour for the next day!  My husband and I were the only ones on the tour of Grant Park, which was a treat as it was like it was our personalized tour.  Marlin gave us so much information, took tons of pictures, and overall we had a great experience.  Added bonus we got in a 3 mile run along the way!  Afterwards Marlin sent us an email detailing everything we saw along with all the uploaded pictures.  He even offered to take us to the art institute the next day, however we did not have enough time as our flight was leaving too early.   Would love to do the Tragic event tour next time.  This is a great way to see Chicago!  Marlin is so incredibly passionate about the city and it's like you're hanging out with a friend.  Highly recommend!
