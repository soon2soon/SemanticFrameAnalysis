This is one thing you definitely must do in Chicago. This place rents out bikes on very reasonable rates. Its tons of fun riding along the lakefront on the bikes and there's acually lots of trails you can follow as well. Its really different from walking or driving through the city. And best of all, you get little or no traffic ;)!
