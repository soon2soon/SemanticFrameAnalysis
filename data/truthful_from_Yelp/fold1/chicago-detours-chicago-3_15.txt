My 17 year old daughter and I did the "Loop Interior Architectural Tour" on Sunday! I highly recommend this tour! It was the perfect amount of time for a walking tour. The tour went by really fast! We are lovers of the city, but learned so many new things while going on this tour. It was wonderful to see the architecture in a different way. For me personally, I was fascinated by the discussions on Frank Lloyd Wright, the steel industry, and seeing the photos of the ComEd sub station. My husband and I were married at a Frank Lloyd Wright home and I work for a steel company and he works for ComEd. So, it all came together perfectly. Our tour guide, Elizabeth, was bright, witty, and very intelligient! You could tell she really loved what she was doing! Great tour!!!!!
