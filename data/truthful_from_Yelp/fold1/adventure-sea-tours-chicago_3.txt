The Valara yacht was AMAZING! It was extremely spacious and held 149 people very comfortably! There were multiple lounges and 2 full bars aboard the yacht. Dealing with the staff at Adventure Sea Tours was great. The were EXTREMELY accommodating to our groups needs, the communication was prompt and precise and the service was excellent. The bartenders were knowledgeable and very friendly. We had to make several changes during our event due to the weather and wind conditions and the staff was very quick to help us out. Gaining access to the yacht was extremely easy and there were parking lots readily available surrounding the Harbor. Our event has been called "The party of the year"! People are still raving about it and asking if we will do another one! We owe it to the staff at Adventure Sea Tours. Thanks a bunch! We will be using your services again!
