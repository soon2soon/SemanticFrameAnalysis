The Hotel Allegro is beautiful. The lobby is stunning and all of the special touches made me feel very pampered (plus they had Aveda bathroom products!) The hotel Â sits in a fabulous location in the Loop. Sure the rooms are on the small side but so are many hotel rooms in Europe (Paris for example). The staff is wonderful. They allow pets and their concierge, Anthony, went above and beyond to help me find a pet sitting service that could check on my special needs cat while I was gone in the evening for a work event. I wish more hotels had the beauty and service that the Hotel Allegro offers.
