Pizza+Cocktails+A Little History+ A Lotta Laughs = Awesome! (Review is for the Pizza & Cocktail Tour) Husband & I spent the last night of a 4 day whirlwind trip to Chicago with our tour guide Kevin & a party bus full of about 18 (total) fun tour mates!  We had Boston, Chicago, Ohio, Florida, New Jersey & Indianapolis represented. Visited 4 restaurants (Flo & Santos, Bella Bacinos, Pizano's and Pequod's)  and experienced: Thin Crust, Stuffed, Deep Dish and Pan Pizza. We were able to order whatever beer/cocktail we wanted at each stop as well. I'm still dreaming about the Deep Dish Cookie Sundae dessert that we also had at Pizano's!   I would go back to any of the four restaurants in a heartbeat.   (Hope to make it back to visit Chicago sooner rather than later...loved it!) You will Laugh (a LOT); learn a little Chicago history that you probably don't get on other tours, and experience some down right DELICIOUS Pizza! Kevin, our tour guide, and "Q" our driver were both great, funny and laid back.     It was well worth the price for the evening considering we got:   Party Bus, Personal Tour Guide, Great Driver, As much Pizza as we wanted  (We definitely tried to pace ourselves at each stop knowing we had more to come.); any type of cocktail/beer/wine that we wanted at each stop and some great entertainment learning about the history of pizza and some cool things about Chicago and places we passed on the way.   It also helped that we ended up with an awesome, funny group of people. You will leave STUFFED and Happy....guaranteed!   I would definitely do it again!
