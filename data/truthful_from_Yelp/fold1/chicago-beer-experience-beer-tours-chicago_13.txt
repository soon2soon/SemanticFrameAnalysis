Jen is a rock star!!! We had a fantastic time and were a group if 11! Most fun we had in Chicago... Definitely a must do! The food was an unexpected treat... Even though I wasn't much of a beer drinker, I found the experience to be well presented and solid! We will definitely do this again as long as Jen is our guide!!!
