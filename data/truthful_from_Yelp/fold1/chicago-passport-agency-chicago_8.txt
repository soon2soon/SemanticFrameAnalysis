I found myself needing an expedited passport renewal and these guys were awesome!!  They are really nice.  The website tells you everything but you have to call asap and get an appointment confirmation number.  They will ask you for it!!!  It is ESSENTIAL, although I didn't have to wait until my appointment time to be seen, I was seen two hours early.  Get to the building EARLY too, like an hour before the place opens.  You have to go through a lengthy security line and there will be another line out the door before the place opens.  Remember, everyone is desperate.  Be patient.  I came prepared, got there early and the whole process took 15 minutes and I had my passport in one day.  If you have everything the website asks for, you can be in and out of there in no time.   Remember, don't forget: 1.  Your appointment confirmation number 2.  Your required forms (fill them out at home) 3.  Your old passport or required ID (check the website) 4.  Your new passport photo!  They do NOT take your picture there!!! 5.  Your travel itinerary print out (they check this too) 6.  Payment!!!
