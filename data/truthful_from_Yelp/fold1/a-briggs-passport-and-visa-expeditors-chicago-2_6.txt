Briggs does everything quickly and efficiently and, most importantly (to me), is in constant communication by email with status updates.  We have been through two one-year Chinese visas together, as well as an order for extra pages to be sewn into my passport by the state dep't in Washington, and it couldn't have gone more smoothly.  Can't imagine what we would have done without them and wouldn't hesitate to use them again.  In fact, I wouldn't use anyone else.
