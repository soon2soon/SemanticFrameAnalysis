It's down pouring in the city of Chicago so how is this walking tour going to work? Well, Dan who is definitely The Man, made it work. We met at the DuSable Statue and thank you Dan for having umbrellas to spare because of course we forgot ours. Let me clarify that although this is called a "Walk Tour" there's not much walking, not even a mile of walking, however, this could be due to our unfavored weather. Even with the noisy streets of Chicago, Dan was able to expand his voice so we can hear him. His stories and his knowledge of Chicago is amazing. I've learned so much more about my city that I would never have thought of. After walking across the DuSable Bridge and learning a little bit more, we dried off inside the comforts of the Pedway and headed to Houlihan's for brunch (around 12:30p). Fresh omelet station, french toast or pancakes, bacon or sausage, hash browns or breakfast potatoes, ham, scrambled eggs, toast, croissants, or bagels, and a lot of fresh fruits. YUM! During our lovely brunch Dan gave us booklets of before and now Chicago to see the difference, for me the biggest impact was seeing how much burned down due to the Chicago Fire, wow. And it's amazing that we don't know who started or what started the fire that burned so much of our beloved city, but also thankful it did because just maybe Chicago would be what it is today if it didn't burn. The pictures were a great visual affect. After brunch we zipped up and headed out. The rain was still there so we used the underground Wacker to our advantage and learn more about some of building's and their history. My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed the tour and Dan was a fantastic guide. P.s. he's also the owner! Thanks for a great piece of history! Love my city, Chi City!
