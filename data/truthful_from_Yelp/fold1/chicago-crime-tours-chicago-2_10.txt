We had no idea that the crime tour was this informative and fun at the same time. The bus was jam-packed and the guide was awesome ( we loved his personality, knowledge and his people skills). We walked at the John Dillinger's death site and Weiss shootout in front of Holy Name Cathedral. We highly recommend this tour: it is very educational and fun!
