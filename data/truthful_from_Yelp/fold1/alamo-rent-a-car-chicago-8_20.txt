We rented a car through Costco online, arrived at the location and a gentleman named Sean (I think this was his name), helped us to the self-service kiosk. Sean was fantastic! He was kind, thoughtful, fun, funny and so customer service driven, aiming to provide us with the best, no hassle experience. He was in one word: Wonderful! We must of been in and out of of Alamo in less than 10 minutes because we ordered a car online. The car was clean and new and had ample room for our luggage. Checkout was a breeze and when we returned with the car, the entire process took about 30 seconds as a courteous and happy attendant was waiting outside to check returning cars in. Fantastic service, friendly people and so pleased that the process was painless! Would definitely recommend Alamo!!
