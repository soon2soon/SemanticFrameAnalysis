Love this place.  In the heart of downtown Chicago.  Shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and bars all within walking distance.  We stayed using rewards points, so prices were not an issue.  They have a nice bar and restaurant area to watch games or wait for your room to be ready.  Free wi-fi and a Starbucks.  Rooms are clean and the staff is very attentive and helpful.  Great stay and more than likely will be back in the future!
