I got back from a wonderful trip to Chicago a couple of weeks ago, and now having (mostly) recovered from the Post-Vacation Sads, I can add my two cents to the chorus of people recommending this hotel. It could well be my favorite place I've ever stayed. Comparisons to the Ace Hotel chain are apt. Location. At a block away from the Red Line, you really can't do better if you're going to be taking Chicago's convenient public transportation everywhere. Likewise, cabs will get you most places quicker and fairly cheaply. There's an Eataly across the street. The Magnificent Mile is a few blocks away. You can walk to the river or a million cool bars. Getting there from O'Hare only takes one simple transfer on the El. The Berkshire Room. A step above your average hotel bar. Great place to end each night with one last cocktail and a final bite or two. The room. So, we sprung for a King Suite (mainly because we wanted the microwave/fridge) and it was absolutely worth it. We were right next to the elevator (12th floor) but didn't hear a thing. Fridge, microwave and sink, great views facing Ohio St, 2 TVs, etc. There's more. Knock-and-drop coffee service. The bakery downstairs. The incredibly high-quality iPod speaker. The fun music in the elevators. God, this place was perfect. Stay here.
