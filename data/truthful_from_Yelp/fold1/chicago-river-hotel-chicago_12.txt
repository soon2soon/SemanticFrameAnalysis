I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel. I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago. I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space.  I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in. Some of the details of our stay included: Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor. Purified water provided at each floor. A coffee pot in the main room....  Not in the bathroom. A refrigerator and microwave. Luxury comforter. Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed. A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system.  A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout. Available Ipads for guest use. The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality. The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges. This hotel provides a great room at a good price. Give this hotel a try!
