This place is great! Convenient location, plenty of parking ramps around so you can get around on foot or on the train. Clean hostel and hip young employees without attitudes. We forgot our entry key in the room when we went out to Club Neo, and when we got back at 4 AM, the guy at the desk was totally cool about it. We were so worried it was going to be an issue, but he was so nice! The free breakfast is limited, but I saw a very innovative lady make a banana peanut butter waffle with what they had to offer. Their free coffee is actually decent. You can also store and cook your own food in their kitchen, and the fellow roomies are totally trustworthy. Lovely patio area, and they do rent nice bikes out if you need an easy way to get around. Rates aren't bad, you do pay a little more for the location though. The shared bathrooms are clean and there is always room for you to get in.
