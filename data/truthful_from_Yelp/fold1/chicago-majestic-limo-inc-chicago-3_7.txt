My husband and I have used CML for a couple of years now, traveling to and from both airports from River North. My husband travels internationally quite a bit, so he's a regular, but we use CML for leisure travel as well. We're hooked! *SO* much nicer than taking some nasty cab, and for a pretty darn reasonable price. The cars are always spotless and the drivers are always on time. And we have to agree with Nick G. - Joe's the best!! Always friendly and engaging, always careful to ask if the temperature's okay, etc. And it's astonishing what a smooth ride we have with him - even in the worst traffic. Lisa always takes care of us - never any issues with last-minute changes, etc. And to echo Chris P.'s comments, we get an email confirmation as soon as we request a reservation. We like CML so much that we now have them pick up out-of-town guests/relatives when they come to visit - what better way to kick off a trip than with a nice ride? (No more "Here's how you get to the El from your gate...")
