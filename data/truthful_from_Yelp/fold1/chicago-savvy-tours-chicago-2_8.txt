This review is for the Underground Tour with Liz.  The tour lasts 2 hours and is partly above, partly below ground. My boyfriend and I were visiting from NYC and wanted to learn a little more about the fascinating infrastructure of Chicago.  Liz was a great guide - energetic, funny, knowledgeable with an endearing Chicago pride! She was fast-talking but being from NY, we liked that.  We learned so many interesting facts about Chicago, like how the city stays so clean and why the river flows the wrong way.  I won't give it away, you have to go on the tour! The tour also includes information about some of the coolest skyscrapers so you get some architecture in too.  We were already impressed with Chicago but now have an even deeper appreciation for its design. I think this tour is great for all age groups and highly recommend it to anyone curious about the history of the city.
