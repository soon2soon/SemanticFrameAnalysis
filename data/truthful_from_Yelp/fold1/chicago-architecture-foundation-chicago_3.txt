Five stars is not enough! We came in the winter, so it was a land tour, and our guide was ten-star brilliant and wonderful. Also, the CFA handled our metro ticketing for us, which was another few stars or so. Basically, this is a fifteen- or twenty- star operation, and the tours would be worthwhile at multiples of the price . . . there's a lot to see in Chicago, and to make sure you don't miss EVERYTHING, take CFA up on at least ONE of their tours! BTW: They run a GREAT gift shop. This isn't just your snowglobe and postcard shoppe, and take my word for it: it isn't that easy to get Frank Lloyd Wright mementos in your home town, so pick 'em up while you can!
