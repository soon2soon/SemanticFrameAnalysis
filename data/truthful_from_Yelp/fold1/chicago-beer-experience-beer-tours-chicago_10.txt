My husband and I were visiting from SOCAL for our first anniversary and we LOVE beer, so this was the perfect tour for the both of us. Natalie was great- Upbeat, spunky, friendly, knowledgeable about beer and Chicago!! We met some cool people, drank/tried some new beers and got see a cool neighborhood in Chicago! Thanks for the great time!
