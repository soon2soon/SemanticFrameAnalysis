Mary and the entire crew on the Valara yacht were a pleasure to work with. The crew went above and beyond to accommodate our group. I cannot remember anyone not having a good time! We had such a great time, that people still to this day are asking us to have another yacht party. That says a lot, doesn't it? The view of the Chicago Skyline that we saw from the Valara was breathtaking. Plenty of awesome picture moments. That coupled with the fun ambiance of the Valara as well as the people on board made our event a success. I can't wait to plan the next yacht party with Mary and Adventure Sea Tours again!
