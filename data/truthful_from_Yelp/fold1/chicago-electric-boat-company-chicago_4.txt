I thought the value on this excursion was outstanding.  We had 6 adults on a boat that sat up to 10 - it was roomy and comfortable.  This place gives you options - bring your own snacks or order from a business partner and have it delivered and ready to you when you arrive - love it!  Also the clear panels came in handy for the quick rain shower that rolled in. When driving a boat that goes this slow, you have to steer often and early to make it obey.  You have to move aside to allow the passing of large tour boats.  The passage through the River North Area was very slow as it is heavily trafficked in summer months.  Large tour boats cruised by and were packed to the gills with patrons who sat in full sun.  In contrast my group enjoyed a shady cover and lots of room on deck. The yelp pictures are very representative of your experience here.  Customer service, booking and payment were easy and streamlined.
