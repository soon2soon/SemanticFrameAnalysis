This was honestly the perfect way to spend a night in Chicago. As a foodie, I am constantly on the lookout for great restaurants but it can get difficult in new cities, especially in a huge city like Chicago. My cousins were interested in trying something new despite being actual Chicago residents and this was perfect for all of us. I was able to eat at three incredible restaurants in one shot, was taken around in a snazzy private bus, AND made friends. God, I'm such a social butterfly. I want this to come to Boston. And New York. And every major city to make it easier to show my friends a good time. Oh and I was worried that this would be a pub crawl-esque kind of tour when they say "the hottest clubs/bars" but it's really just you and the group. NOT THE CASE AT ALL. These are restaurants that I would have chosen on my own, all beautiful in their own way. That sounds really poetic. But for serious, Sim approves. I would do it again in a heartbeat as restaurants are always rotated, woo!
