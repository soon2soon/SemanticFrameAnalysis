I live in Chicago and don't own a bike yet, but I will certainly recommend the crap out of this place. The location we used was on Randolph and customer service was phenominal. Umber (spelling?) was helpful and very personable, as was the gentleman that we returned our bikes to. We printed off a coupon from the internet to use and my brother and I rode bikes all around the city for a reasonable price. (He paid, so I'm not sure what it ended up being). If you are a tourist and looking to bike around the city, go to these guys. They're awesome.
