This could easily be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I loved it that much. The service was excellent, the suite was completely spotless and comfortable. The bed? The most comfortable (apart from my own) that I ever slept in. If you EVER STAY THERE, order the vanilla bean cupcakes from room service with a bottle of champagne...best way to spoil yourself in the hotel. The restaurant in the hotel has fabulous dessert options if you need something sweet with your night cap. It is in a fabulous location, as well - I didn't have to walk far to get to Michigan Avenue ...just a few steps and I was there. I was extremely pleased with the service and the look - it was chic and fun to stay in. I would stay there again over any other hotel in Chicago, any day of the week. I love that place and I can't wait to go back!
