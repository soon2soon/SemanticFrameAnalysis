Great film tour. This was our second attempt at taking the film tour.  The first attempt was last month when the bus was running 45 minutes late due to traffic on the expressway. Good thing we had a groupon that we could use to reschedule.  We didnt want to wait the 45 minutes! So this time the tour was on time. The bus was actually early to arrive. I was extremely happy the bus was air conditioned and smelled lemon fresh! The tour lasted about 2 hours. It was non-stop movie clip playing while the bus was driving us to the places that were shot on film and our tour guide was giving us the history of it all. Our tour guide knew SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much about the movies. I'm impressed she saw them all (or maybe just most of them?).  The films that they played dated as far back as 1915 (His New Job) and as late as 2009 (Time Traveler's Wife). I never knew SO MANY films had clips of Chicago in them. How awesome to have this information pointed out to me! I highly recommend this tour!
