Used Chicago Limos Inn for our wedding night for a ride from the Peggy N Nature Museum back to our hotel.  It was a very clean, well maintained sedan, and our driver was fantastic. The price is right, and negotiated up front.  The driver was prompt, pleasant, and quick. I'd use Chicago Limos Inn again in a heartbeat.  Exceptional service.
