I went for a 6 PM ride with my boyfriend. We booked two weeks in advance not anticipating the insane rain storm. The tickets were paid for, the boat ride was not canceled, so of course we still went. We were completely soaked from the rain but it's not the tour people's fault it rained. The tour itself was so wonderful. Tons of information, we learned a lot about the architecture, and we're natives! I loved learning about the different architecture styles, my personal favorite being art deco. I've actually been trying to find the list of buildings we looked at because we want to have our own personal tour downtown on foot, just to explore it more. The pictures I took on my phone came out really nice even with the rain. I would love to go again on a dryer day.
