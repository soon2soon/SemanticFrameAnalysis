On the last trip we'll have to Chicago for a loooong time, we decided to be uber tourists. So the day after we did a river architecture tour, we decided to embark on the Explorers' Pedway Tour. :D This tour was awesome! Call me a nerd, but I love love hearing about all of the history behind a city. Honestly, the stories behind the buildings and influential people are what make a city worth visiting. This tour included those stories and was great for several other reasons (in no particular order): 1. We used Groupons, which made it very cheap for us. There was no difficulty or bitterness from the company when I reserved the tour. (You know, sometimes companies are mean when you tell them you have a discount code) 2. Our tour guide, Daniel, was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He also had two  games for the tourists, including one involving a prize and one involving gift cards. It kept us engaged and made learning fun. Adults are just as easily bribed as kids.. 3. There was a lot of walking! It was great for our majorly food-heavy visit to Chicago. We also popped up out of the pedway to get an idea of where in the city we were and see some of the great architecture.   4. Free popcorn! This was a pleasant surprise... :) I definitely recommend!
