Took this tour yesterday it was excellent! Very entertaining and enjoyable. I now have a long list of movies to see many of which I had no idea were filmed in Chicago. Not only does the tour provide information on movies filmed in Chicago, it gives you a glimpse of many of Chicago neighborhoods. A real feel of Chicago. We went from downtown to Lincoln Park to Uptown to Noblesville, Old Town, the Gold Coast, the South Loop, Chinatown and more. The host John and the very entertaining guide Patrick were great as well. The movie clips are perfect. I would highly recommend this tour to local Chicagoans as well as tourists.
