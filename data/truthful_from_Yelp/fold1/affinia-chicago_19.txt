Awesome stay!  We had such a great time at the Affinia over Christmas.  We were upgraded to the King Suite for an additional $20.  The room was HUGE!  The bathroom alone was the size of my kitchen/dining room combined.  Very modern and great decor.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  There is a self parking lot across the street for $40... not too bad for the area.
