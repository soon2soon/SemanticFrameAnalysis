After I posted my review of my previous cruise with the Chicago Line, I received a message from them through Yelp apologizing for the experience and inviting me to return for a better experience. It took me quite a while to get back to Chicago, but when I did I contacted them and they graciously provided me and the two friends who were with me on the original cruise a chance for a new experience. I'm glad we gave them another shot, because it was a wonderful experience! Instead of the historic river/lake cruise, we took the more standard architectural river tour. The tour takes you through a good part of the city, so you get to see a ton of different interesting sites. Our docent was very knowledgeable and did a great job integrating history, fun facts and architectural information. One of the friends I was with is an art history/architecture buff, so she was really interested in a lot of the more technical details about the buildings. I just like to look at pretty things and am more entertained by stories about what famous person lives where. We both left happy! Our boat was quite full and I was worried we'd be a bit cramped but there was plenty of room for everyone. We showed up half an hour early and there was already quite a long line waiting to board the boat, if it's important to you to be in chairs (rather than on the benches around the outside of the deck) you'll probably want to get there even earlier than that. I'd recommend bringing a hat and sunscreen, as even in the early spring it was very sunny! Downstairs they had cookies and lemonade, and it was a great place to take a break from the sun for a few minutes. I'm glad I gave the Chicago Line Cruises a second chance! My next trip to Chicago I'm planning to take another ride on the historic lake and river tour to see the city from another perspective.
