Went on the BBB tour; Bikes, Bites, and Brew.  Enjoyed getting to parts of the city we hadn't seen before except racing by on the L or in a cab.  The ride was easy and our guide Jim did a great job pointing out historical facts while keeping us safe as well.  I would definitely recommend this tour for anyone whether it is your first time to Chicago or twentieth.   Tour took four hours but went by fast.  We stopped at Gino's East, Swirlz Cupcakes, Murphy's,  Murphy's Bleachers, & R.J. Grunts.   Thanks to everyone at BBH and especially Jim.
