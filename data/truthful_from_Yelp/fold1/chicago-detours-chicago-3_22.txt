I can't believe how much new information I learned in just 3 hours about Chicago's architecture and history. Amanda is a smarty pants (but in a totally awesome and accessible way). I did the Good Times Historic Bar Tour so it was extra fun because we drank...it was like a pub crawl for history geeks. Highly recommend for visitors and Chicagoans alike! I look forward to going on all of them.
