This was the second best city tour I've ever been on.  Only second to a cocktail tour in my hometown New Orleans.  Booze always wins.  All of the delicious pizzas made it impossible for me to eat pizza at home ever again.  I still dream about that Italian beef pizza (drool).  For 60 dollars I got seven slices of pizza (with the option for seconds), a ride all over the city, and history of Chicago.  It was like taking a food and city tour all in one.  The tour maxes out at 16 so its very intimate.  We met two local couples who gave recommendations of where else to go in the city.  My mom recently moved to Chicago and I can't wait to go back so I can go on this tour again.
