The shuttle drivers have got to be the most professional, most friendly, most hard working I have ever seen....and I travel and rent cars almost every week.  The announcements weren't those pre-recorded things but the drivers speak clearly and explain the stops.  They automatically unload your luggage for you, considering it just part of their job.  But when returning my car to ORD, a very unusual thing happened.  I left my wallet in the front passenger seat...I guess when I paid for my gas, I must have missed getting the wallet into my purse.  I had cut the traveling time too close and breathed a sigh of relief that I would get to the terminal just in time to catch my flight...but on the ride to the terminal discovered the missing wallet.  Incidentally the driver, before we pulled away from the lot, had requested that we check all our belongings but I had never left anything behind in any rental before so disregarded him.  As we drove, I worked my way to the front of the bus and told him what had happened.  I don't know how they did it so fast but Alamo employees found the wallet and the driver of the next bus was on its way to deliver it to me!  They were so efficient, my driver told me the exact bus number it was on, so that I would know when the bus arrived.  Meanwhile I resigned myself to the fact I would miss my flight because surely it would take a certain amount of time to stop, unload passengers and travel to me.  But the next bus with my wallet was there within like 10 minutes!!! And yes, I caught my flight!!!  I know it wouldn't have been possible without Alamo's wonderful employees....they actually care about the customer.
