Well, color me surprised! I typically don't love touristy things.   I had a friend in town though, and all she ever wants to is eat good Chicago food.   Every time she visits, I pay a visit to Yelp and try to take her somewhere new.    She visits OFTEN, and I was running out of ideas.   Chicago Dine-Around actually was a suggestion from a foodie friend of mine, and did not disappoint.   The restaurant choices were muy impressivo.   The guide was not cheesy at all.   Rather charming really.    Could've been the drinking on the bus, but the crowd felt like we were out with a large group of friends.     I plan on scheduling another one when my Vegas cousins come to visit.    Great way give someone the vibe of the town, all in one night.
