My husband and I went on the evening Segway tour and it was awesome! I bought the your through Groupon and got a super deal. As we were on our way there, we got into a lot of traffic and knew we were going to be late, so I called ahead to let ten know. They were most helpful, telling us exactly where to park and how to find them. When we arrived almost 10 minutes late, they had been waiting for us and we're very kind giving us a quick lesson and then we headed out. The evening was super fun as we toured different landmarks and attractions along the lake shore. I highly recommend!!! Super friendly staff
