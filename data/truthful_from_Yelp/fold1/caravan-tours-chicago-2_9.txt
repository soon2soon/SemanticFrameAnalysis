Since my previous review from 2 years ago, we have joined Caravan to Yellowstone/Mt Rushmore (September 2010) and Guatemala (January 2012). Our guide for Yellowstone was fantastic and made the trip remarkably informative. Staying at Old Faithful Inn was great too. In Cody, WY, Buffalo Bill Historical Center Â  is a MUST see...I don't like guns, but the museum exhibits are awesome! We had a great time at Bar J Chuckwagon Suppers. Great trip! For Guatemala, it was much more relaxed than Costa Rica - much of the trip was about the Churches (a bit too much for me) and Mayan Ruins (Tikal was AWESOME). The market in Chichicastenango was fun and interesting. Caravan REALLY had the tour guide explain the do's/don'ts regarding food - they really discouraged us from trying street food and such (in an attempt to make sure all were well on the trip). Very good trip. If anyone needs more details, just email me. I got 1000s of pics, but haven't even tried sorting them yet. What I said previously still holds true now - most travelers are friendly 50 and over folks. Good amount of travel on coach.
