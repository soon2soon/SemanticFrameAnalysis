There are tons of tours like this in Chicago, but his one isn't cheesy at all. These guys really did their background research, no costumes or corny reenactments here.  You spend plenty of time at each location to get food or drinks.  Our guide had a mouth like a sailor and was super opinionated, which I personally found hilarious, but I wouldn't recommend this tour to the very religious.  Also wouldn't recommend it if you are a recovering alcoholic, but well, duh!
