We used Chicago Private Tours for a recent Christmas Party, and it was the best decision!  The vehicle was spotless.  The driver was perfect and helpful. The tour guide was knowledgeable.  They took us on a great tour of the city, and did everything they could do to make it perfect! I can't say enough good things about how they treated us!
