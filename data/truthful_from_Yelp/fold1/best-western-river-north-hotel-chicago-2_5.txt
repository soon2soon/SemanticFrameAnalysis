AWESOME HOTEL!!!!!!! Booked this hotel because we wanted to be in a semi-central location to check out neighborhoods we might be renting apartments in, and our stay was amazing. The location is incredible -- steps away from the El and some of the best restaurants and bars in the city, and we could get anywhere we wanted in the city in 20 minutes or less. And the price is unbelievable! For downtown Chicago with free parking and a fairly decent room, we felt like we had scored a major deal. We would absolutely stay here again in the future (in fact, we probably will when we come back) and absolutely recommend it to others (especially if you're driving into the city.) The only tiny drawback was we noticed after about 8 PM, they started letting cars double-park behind other cars to cram everyone into the parking lot... but really, you're not going anywhere at 8 PM, and by the time we checked out all the double-parked cars were gone... So, no big deal!
