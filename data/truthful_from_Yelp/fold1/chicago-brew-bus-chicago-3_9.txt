Had such an awesome time on this tour. Kevin was very helpful with planning and was an awesome host/drinking partner. Nick & johnny the driver were also a great addition to the experience. Â I recommend this to anyone who wants to have an awesome time. Kevin thanks again for everything (especially the irish prayer bottle opener you freely gave to my bf) he LOVES it. We will def be seeing you guys again!
