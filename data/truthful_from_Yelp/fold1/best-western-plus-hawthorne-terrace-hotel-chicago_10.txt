Great location if you're looking for a hotel not in the heart of the city. Lakeview is a nice neighborhood. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to express buses that run downtown. As for the "L" it is located near the Belmont (Red, Brown, and Purple Lines) and Addison (Red line) stops.
