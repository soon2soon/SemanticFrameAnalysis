So if you book here make sure you get a cheap rate and the discounted parking if you need it.  The base rate here can be as low as 169 but everything is extra, including in room wifi.  If you don't get the parking package the valet rate is something like 45.  The rooms are small and can seem a little outdated.   All that said the staff here are utterly fantastic and that makes it for me.
