I was on this tour today and I really enjoyed it! We used a Groupon so we basically got a "buy 1 get 1". I learned a lot and so did my GF who is obsessed with a lot of the people that were covered in the tour. Some of the highlights was the story about the Rock and Roll McDonalds, the El Train Pile Up, and learning more about things you don't always hear about. The tourguide-Will, was so funny and really interesting to listen to. I woke up and didn't want to go on the tour because I was so sleepy and instead I'm glad I woke up and get my life together since my GF and I really enjoyed it. I would go on another tour with the company.
