We absolutely loved staying at Allegro. We got a room block for our wedding guests and stayed there ourselves for five nights. The hotel gave us a steal of a price and even upgraded us to a suite, which was very large with a living/dining room and large bedroom. The bathroom was big, jacuzzi tub and shower were one of the best I've ever had at a hotel. On the night of our wedding, the sales manager we worked with sent us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries - Claudia was a gem and so sweet to work with! Our guests loved the hotel as well. Yes, the building is a bit older but it comes with a lot of charm. The bellman are fabulous, so helpful and nice. Complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby which we were too busy to enjoy but our guests said it was fun. Great, great location...a few minutes from millennium park and shopping on state street. Despite being located next to the train station, it doesn't impact your staying or sleep at all. The hotel bar was great and clearly a trendy, after-work spot based on the foot traffic we saw in there. Connected to a starbucks, which is always a bonus for me. I look forward to staying here again. Such a great hotel for a reasonable price...don't miss out on this one!
