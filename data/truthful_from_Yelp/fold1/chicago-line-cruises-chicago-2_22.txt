Loved the cruise. Learned a great deal. Was refered to this company from our hotel concierge. They reserved us spots in advance. The tour provides cookies, lemonade and coffee during the 1.5 hour tour. totally worth the 36$ (more than other tours but worth it). Loved our tour guide's stong mid-west accent.
