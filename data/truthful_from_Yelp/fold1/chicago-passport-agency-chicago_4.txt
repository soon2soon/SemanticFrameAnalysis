Don't panic. If you're like me, and realized that your passport is expired the day before leaving for France, you will be able to renew your passport! You just have to follow these steps (read all of the other reviews too) to the letter. 1. Call the agency immediately and request an appointment. Even if it's not for 2 weeks out, take down the appointment number. This will help you get in the room. It is essential. 2. Gather all of the materials that the agency wants and bring them with you. Especially important is the appointment number and your flight information. 3. Get a valid passport photo. I went to Walgreens and they messed it up and my face wasn't big enough. (So I had to leave and get a new photo and come back through security but it still all worked out. This is why it pays to be polite to everyone so you can skip the line to get back in if needed.) 4. Get to the agency EARLY. Like, an hour before they open. You'll wait in an excruciating line to go through security. Be polite to everyone working there. 5. When you finally get up to the office, a security guard will ask for your appointment number (which you have, even if it's 2 weeks away) and your flight info. If your flight is that day, you get priority. 6. You wait for a bit and they call your number. Deep breaths. Remain calm. Be polite. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. 7. Present all your information to the staff person. They collect it and give you a time to come back and pick up your renewed passport. I went there first thing in the morning, my flight was in the evening, and I got my passport at 1pm. 8. Come back at your assigned time, no earlier. They make sure that you have plenty of time to make your flight. But that's why it pays to get in line early. You'll be fine! Deep breaths :)
