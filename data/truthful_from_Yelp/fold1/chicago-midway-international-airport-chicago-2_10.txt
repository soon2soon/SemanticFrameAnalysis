Closer to city, smaller lines, quicker check-in, smaller footprint so less "traveling distance within the airport," many reasons why I much prefer this airport to O'Hare, or many reasons why this is simply a rock solid airport without comparing it to others. In general if you fly in or out of here, odds are you will start or end your trip on a better note.
