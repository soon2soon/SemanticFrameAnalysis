This State Department agency might just take the place of the Chicago DMV as my favorite government service center. Seriously, I've never been so thankful for a positive, efficient experience. I realized that my passport was expiring the day before a scheduled trip to Sweden with only one business day before take-off and immediately called the national 877 number. While there were no appointments in the automated system, I was redirected to customer service who put me on a will call wait list, but it didn't sound likely that I'd end up getting in during the one day window I had. I lined up an expediting service (Swift -- highly recommended based on my interactions) but ended up getting a personal (non-automated) phone call from the Chicago agency at 7:30AM telling me they could fit me in if I made it that morning. I was ecstatic to say the least. And while I ended up making a couple trips back and forth to the agency (thanks to needing to return to hand write my address on my check... which my agent actually called my cell phone to tell me), my passport was ready for pickup at 1PM.
