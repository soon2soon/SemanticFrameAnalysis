Just went on the Northside tour with the family, really impressed!  Would absolutely recommend everyone to take one of these yours, it's the best way to learn about Chicago and find out about good food spots.  Our tour guide, Kent, was knowledgeable and fun. Can't wait to take other tours from this company in future trips to Chicago.
