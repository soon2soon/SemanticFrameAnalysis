We stayed two nights here over St. Patricks day weekend.  My boyfriend and I both loved the hotel. The staff was very friendly and our room was very clean. They even brought Irish coffee to us in the morning! Our room did not have a view of the city,  just a view of another building.  But I'm sure you could request a room with a view. However the lack of view did not bother us. Just a heads up,  parking is about $20 a night in the garage next door. (if I remember correctly) I'm sure we would have paid more by finding our own lot,  so it is what it is. Bonus,  the hotel is about a block away from the red line subway station.  So we were able to take the train everywhere instead of getting a cab. Overall we LOVED this hotel and will definitely book here again next time we are in Chicago.
