Spent the weekend at the Marriott- family of 4. Ideal location for great dinning and shopping. Starbucks in the lobby is convenient. Room 4119 was impeccable. Front desk and concierge staff were both very helpful and patient. My only complaint was unable to watch the Blackhawks game in my room (no CSN channel). Overall it was an excellent stay!
