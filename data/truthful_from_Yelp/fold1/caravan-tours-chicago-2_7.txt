Last year at this time, I stood in silly costume and got to pick a curtain on 'Let's Make a Deal'. I won the grand prize. A trip to New England for me and a guest. I haven't taken the tour yet, but I wanted to say what a great experience I've had so far in planning the trip with Caravan Tours. (I will revise this when the trip is done). They have been so incredibly helpful, professional and get an A+ for being so accommodating as I try to line up the dates to take the trip. Nothing but a joy (even the receptionist celebrated my win with a big congratulations). Thank you Caravan, I have all the confidence in the world that this will be a trip of a lifetime (I can see why game shows use your services). I can't wait.
