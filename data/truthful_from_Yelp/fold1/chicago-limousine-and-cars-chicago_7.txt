i don't normally review services, but i felt compelled to review chicago limousine & cars because of the excellent service my cousin and family members received. my cousin had her quincea√±era party (similar to a sweet 16) and wanted a limo ride for her closest friends and relatives. the limo arrived 10 minutes early and as with most parties and events, we were running behind schedule. the driver was kind enough to patiently wait for us to exit my cousin's home and remained very courteous throughout the whole ride. what astonished me the most was the interior of the limousine! it was so clean and well-kept. i would definitely recommend giving chicagon limousine & cars a try. i had a very pleasant experience!
