I took about 10 students on the Pedway Tour.  Margaret connected well with the students which ranged from 5th - 8th grade.  They were engaged and learned so much while actively walking.  When Margaret wrapped up the tour, my students wanted to do more exploring.  So many of us had no idea the Pedway even existed.  It's a whole new underground world!
