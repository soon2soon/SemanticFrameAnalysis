Margaret was the tour guide.  She started the tour on time, ended on time, and everything in between was spot on.  I work as a tour guide myself and her historical facts were all accurate.  She was a happy host, friendly, knowledgeable, , loud enough, and flexible - taking questions and incorporating them into the tour. The tour was around Second City and encompassed a small area.  It was impressive to see how much history was in such a small area, and the tour flowed well from one topic to the next. It would have been cool to see some behind-the-scenes Second City stuff, but I'm not sure if that possibility exists.
