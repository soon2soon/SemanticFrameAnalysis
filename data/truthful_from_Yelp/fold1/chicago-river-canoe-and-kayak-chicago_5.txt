How can I say this without sounding too over-the-top?.... I love this company! Specifically the Skokie Lagoons location in Winnetka. I might just love them so much because of the lone fact that they helped me setup the perfect proposal to my girlfriend (now fiance)! That might be a good enough reason on its own - but there's more: the scenery is great, the water is so peaceful, and the people that work there are so accommodating and just beyond nice. For those interested, I began planning the proposal to (then) my girlfriend in early June. Ryan, one of their employees, helped me piece it together. He had some of his associates (and even some LivingSocial associates) involved. By mid-July, it was all ironed out. My idea was to somewhat replicate the "Kiss The Girl" boat scene from The Little Mermaid (my fiance's favorite cartoon growing up). So ideally, I wanted us to go off on our own for a bit and I would ask her. Another Chicago River Canoe & Kayak associate, Liam, was in on it and even kayaked over to take the pictures you see in the collage (which I added to their photos) - how amazing is that?? In the end, she said yes (thank you, Mary!), we got tons of amazing photos taken by Liam, and it all worked out so much better than even I expected it to. I can't write this review (and I wish I can give these guys 6 stars) without again thanking Ryan and Liam as well as Rachel, Martha, Lindsay, and everyone else associated with the 07-15-12 trip. I'll never forget that day as it was not only the first time I canoed, but also the first (and God willing last!) time I proposed to anyone!
