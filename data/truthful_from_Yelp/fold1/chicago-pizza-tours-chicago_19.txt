I really enjoyed the "best pizzas" that we tried in the city.  They really hit the taste buds and was a delightful food experience.  We went to 4 places total.  Some were okay in my opinion and others were mouth-watering good.  The good thing about doing a tour like this is that you get a mini-tour of the city as well.  We learned a few ins and outs of Chicago.  The fellow patrons were just awesome as well.  I really had a great time other than trying to digest all the pizza I ate. :)  Recommended if you like pizza and want an intro to the city.
