So much fun and so much pizza!! The tour guide was awesome... Very knowledgeable and knows how to crack a joke or two. Â The pizza was amazing!! Stop at 4 places all having different styles of pizza, no chains or franchises.... Meaning no Giordano's...which was ok to me. I would highly recommend the Chicago Pizza Tour!! Take it twice!!
