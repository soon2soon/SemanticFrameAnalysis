This is a great tour, you get great beer and a walking tour of neighborhood bars. The guides are excellent, good Chicago beer history, and if you want to you can end up drinking a lot of beer. Then there is the beer and bacon how can you beat that:) My daughters gave me this as a birthday gift, they met two girls their age and we continued to bar hop a bit after the tour ended!! Cheers
