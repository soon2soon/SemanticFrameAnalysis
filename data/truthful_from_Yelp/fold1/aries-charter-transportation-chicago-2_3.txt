We used Aries Transportation for a bus trip from a bar in Chicago to a Blackhawks game last weekend and I left my iphone on the bus. I called them the next day and the employees were extremely helpful and diligent in locating and returning my lost phone to me. I want to thank Lisa and Rita for answering and returning my phone calls in a timely manner and being exceptionally patient, professional, and polite. I would also like to thank the driver of the bus who put extra effort in searching between all the seats until finding and returning my phone. Iphones are very expensive and rarely returned when found. In my experience Aries charter transportation is a very highly rated professional trustworthy company. :)
