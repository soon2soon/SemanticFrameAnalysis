Great service and car selection! We booked our rental through Priceline. The daily rate was extremely affordable and we were able to drive around in style. The agent inquired about what we drove at home and he gave us a similar car so we were comfortable with the mechanisms and drive. I will only rent from Alamo from now on. Bye, bye Enterprise!
