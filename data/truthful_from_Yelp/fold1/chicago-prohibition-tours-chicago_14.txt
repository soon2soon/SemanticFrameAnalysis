My wife and I had a blast on this tour. I'm from Chicago and wanted to have some fun and learn more about my great city as well without it being cheesy. Our tour guide Jonathan accomplished this with the highest level of cool possible. He was passionate and informative but most importantly, fun! Each stop was unique and offerered a different perspective of the prohibition era. I would highly recommend this tour to Chicagoans specifically because of the unique insight into an important part of the city's history. It's not "touristy" at all, and almost all of the people on the tour were from here. That told me that people are beginning to find out about this...as they should!
