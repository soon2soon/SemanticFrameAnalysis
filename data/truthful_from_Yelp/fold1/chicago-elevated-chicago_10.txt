I can't recommend Margaret's tours highly enough. She's friendly, knowledgable, passionate and energetic. We LOVED the Pedway Tour - getting to see Chicago from the inside was amazing, and it was great to have the Pedway demystified! We will definitely be making room in our schedule for more of her tours next time we're staying in Chicago.
