Of all the hotels I've stayed at in Chicago, this one is my favorite.  I'm in Chicago about 4x/year for business, and Affinia has those nice little touches that makes them stand out from the crowd. ROOM: I stayed in a king room, and this category is one where affinia is fairly standard.  Bed, TV, desk, bathroom are all pretty par for the course, although I appreciated the big oval ottoman which is perfect for putting your shoes on before heading out the door.  The bathroom, however, was really nice.  I hate it when you stay in a nice hotel and the room is spacious by virtue of making the bathroom a closet.  There was no tub in my room, but the shower was huge - the size of a small walk-in closet, practically.  In-house toiletries were a step above standard. FITNESS ROOM: Really nice!  Several treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, and weight machines.  The treadmills have TVs and plugs for your iPod so you can listen to your own music and also listen to the "fitness guide" recite your workout milestones to you.  There's also a water cooler, towels, and a bathroom in the fitness room itself, which was nice. SERVICE: Great service.  Quick and friendly check-in and check-out, and they were kind when I called with embarrassment that I couldn't find the fitness room. OTHER AMMENITIES: Affinia offers these cool "kits" that while I didn't try them out, were a nice touch and are definitely on my to-do list for my next stay.  Guests have their choice between a wine themed kit, a fitness themed kit (with a yoga mat, blocks, weights, and dvds), and a city walking tour kit (including an iPod pre-loaded with a walking tour of the city and a map) - for FREE!  A definite differentiator for this hotel. In case you can't tell, I really enjoyed this hotel and will certainly put it at the top of my preference list next time I book a trip to Chicago.
