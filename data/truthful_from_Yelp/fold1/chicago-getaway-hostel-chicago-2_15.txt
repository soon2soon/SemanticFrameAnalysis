Amazing location!!! On a quiet tree-lined street that is just a 2 minute walk to Clark Street and the heart of Lincoln Park. Super professional and helpful staff, very clean, and has lots of amenities in the shared lobby and outdoor space. Different activities led by the staff nightly and bike rentals available.
