Ploy, our guide, gave us an exquisite tour of Chinatown! Her stories and information gave me a greater appreciation not just  for the Chinese food but the culture too. Each restaurant had amazing cuisine and Ploy made it turn into a fantastic experience by pointing out little know facts about our surroundings and how it fits into the Chinese culture.  I will definitely take another tour and buy tickets as gifts for family. Thanks for the fun foodie experience!
