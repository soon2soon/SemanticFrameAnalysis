As an employee of Marriott i was very happy to see that they treated me like they would any other guest.  Sometimes as employees we get treated with much less of a welcoming feeling by other associates.  The Magnificent Mile made me feel like they truely cared.  I also have to give a shout out to the staff at the lobby bar.  They were perfect in every way possible.  Easily the friendliest staff I've encountered at a Marriott in my 8+ years with the company.
