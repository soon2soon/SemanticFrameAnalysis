It's a storefront for the Chicago Architecture Foundation (or CAF), mainly the CAF Gift Shop and a convenient walkthrough to the lobby of the Railway Exchange Building where their permanent model of the city is (also go upstairs to view the rest of the building). Although many Yelpers seem to be writing their reviews of CAF river tours on this page, the place to go to catch that river boat tour is a few miles to the north. Also the better Yelp page for your boat/river tour reviews is at tinyurl.com/lurar8f . You can purchase tickets for all of the CAF tours at this shop (but that's better done at their Web site or via TicketMaster) but it IS the meet-up place for all of their architectural tours EXCEPT the river tour. The Michigan Avenue entrance is just a few doors down from that of Symphony Center/Orchestra Hall - the home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. What's nice about the gift shop is that a wide price range of items is available. The items have to do not just with architecture and Chicago, but also design, graphics, signage, architectural ornament, photography, and just some fun things.
