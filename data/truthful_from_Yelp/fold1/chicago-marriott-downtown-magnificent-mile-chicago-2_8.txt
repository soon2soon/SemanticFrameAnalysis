The lobby of this hotel is gorgeous! It's perfect for lounging and just chilling. The room look like any other typical hotel room and it's clean. The staffs are friendly, when we request more things, they bring it right away. I also love how this hotel is connected to the Forever21 and walkable distant to many shops and restaurants. Oh yeah, there's complimentary water at the lobby; and Starbuck is located at the lobby too.
