Great value hotel in downtown chicago. Really nice rooms and great location for going out/nightlife. One of the more unique features of the Kinzie is that every floor (there are 6) has breakfast on a long table by the elevators. Granted, its not a hot breakfast, but very convenient to grab and take back to your room, or on your way out.
