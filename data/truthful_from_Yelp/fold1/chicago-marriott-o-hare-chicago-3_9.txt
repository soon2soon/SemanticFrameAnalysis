After reading the previous reviews, I was really weary and dreading my stay at this hotel, but had no choice since it was the location of my emergency board exam.  However, I was extremely pleasantly surprised when we stayed in the renovated rooms, lobby (a $40 million renovation).   Room service was excellent, in-room breakfast was succulent and the gym was brand new, free, with complimentary headphones, water and apples, the treadmill all had their own Tv's.     in other words,  don't be afraid to stay here anymore, the horror stories do not apply anymore.
