"Why don't we just do this every weekend?!" We had such a great time with CEBC! Similar to other reviews, I found the management extremely helpful and accommodating. The process was simple and hassle-free, and our group had a lot of fun! The concept is great - eating/drinking on the river, what's not to love?
