Off the charts the best!!! Just did the Holiday Lights Tour this past weekend and it was spectacular- all aspects of it, the walking tour, the fun trivia games along the way, the stories and history, the bus tour and the 'extras' on the bus :) along with all of the inside tour guides connections at the various hotels- wow you get way more than you pay for on this!! I've done the pedway tour before and that was terrific as well but this was just fantastic. Cannot recommend enough!!!!
