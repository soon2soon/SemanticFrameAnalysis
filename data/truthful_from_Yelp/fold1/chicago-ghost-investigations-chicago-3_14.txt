These ghost tours are fantastic! The guides are wonderful, and they all shared great knowledge and experience with the guests to help us have a successful paranormal investigation of our own. I've been on two tours, and using the divining rods, I've made contact with spirits both times. I even got to communicate with my friend who had passed away last year!
