We had a great experience with Alamo at O'Hare. We started off with an amazing deal on Priceline which came to about $15 a day including tax and service charges. The pick up and drop off was smooth as silk. The shuttle picked us up and dropped us off rather quickly, and check in was painless. They were out of economy sized cars so they basically told us to take anything on the lot. We walked around a bit and finally chose a sporty Dodge something or other which was brand new and ran like a dream. This was my second favorite car rental upgrade experience ever...once in Krakow, Poland, Europcar ran out of everything except Mercedes sedan's, so they wound up giving us a 7 class upgrade. Anyway, the drop off literally took about 2 minutes and a shuttle to the terminal was waiting right there. Everything was a piece of cake. I'd definitely go out of my way to use Alamo in Chicago again. Good stuff.
