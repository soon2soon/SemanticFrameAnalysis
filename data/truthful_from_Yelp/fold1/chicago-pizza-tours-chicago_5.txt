My husband and I had seriously the best time ever on the pizza tour. Our tour guide, Danny, was very knowledgable about both pizza and the city. Every stop we made was delicious. We had pizza at pizano's (oprah's favorite), flo and santos (Italian and polish fusion), pequods (Adam richman's favorite), and piece (new haven style pizza.) Every pizza was downright delicious. My favorite was the flo's polish which was topped with kielbasa, sauerkraut, and applewood smoked bacon. YUM!! We also got a great tour of Chicago along with our pizza offerings. Danny knows the city really well so we got lots of great information on the bus. If you are going to take a tour of Chicago, this is the one to take. We ate the most incredible pizzas, saw an awesome city, learned new things, and had a great time. J can't recommend it enough.
