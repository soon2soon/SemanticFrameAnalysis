Christina was our tour guide for the Bucktown/Wicker Park tour, and she was fantastic! She was very friendly and knowledgable about the history of each type of food we tasted, the restaurants we went to, and was able to share interesting facts about the Bucktown/Wicker Park area all throughout the tour. My friend and I are locals here, but my dad was visiting us from out-of-state, so we thought this would be a fun way for us to explore a bit of the city, and it most definitely was! As I already said, we loved Christina, our tour guide, plus the tour started right on time. The food/drinks that we tried at each place were absolutely delicious, and we do plan on going back to them to try more of their menu options. I have been to one of the restaurants prior to the tour, and it was nice to learn a little more about their history and try something different (very tasty too). I would recommend this tour to any tourist or local food-enthusiast!
