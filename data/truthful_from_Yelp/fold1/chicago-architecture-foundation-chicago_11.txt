This tour is a must do for any architecture lover! I chose to do the boat tour through the Architecture Foundation, and they did not disappoint. Although the view at the sky deck of the Sear's Tower was breathtaking, I would still say that this tour was one thing I enjoyed the most on our trip as far as arts/museums/tours are concerned. There is so much beauty and diversity in the Chicago Skyline, and you learn so much and get to see it up close going up and down the river. They also take you out on the lake so you can take it all in at the end as well. I got more than my money's worth on this tour. You will not be disappointed!
