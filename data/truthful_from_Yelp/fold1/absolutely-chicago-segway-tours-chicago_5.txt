So much fun! Whether you're visiting Chicago or a local resident, this is something you must try! you might think that this is just your average tour of Chicago, but it's not. it's all about the Segways! The Segways were a blast and i seriously can't wait do it again. Â We had Benjamin and Aaron (spl?) as our tour guides and they were great! Thanks for the fabulous day!
