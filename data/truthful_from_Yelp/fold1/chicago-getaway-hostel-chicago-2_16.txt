Stayed here on the last weekend of July, 2011 and is easily my favorite hostel. I've stayed at several in various countries (South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia) and Chicago Getaway Hostel takes the cake! The staff were very friendly and welcoming when we arrived. I had ordered a parcel and had it sent to the hostel prior to my arrival and they promptly gave it to me upon checking-in without me asking. The hostel is very modern and features a good sized dining area, piano room, lounge, patio, and kitchen. In the kitchen, you can use one of their bins to store your food & drinks in their large refrigerator. They serve breakfast and the selection is your usual cereal, fruits, toast & coffee but the food is fresh and of good quality. Stayed in a private room with a half closet and no bathroom. Our room had it's own Air Conditioning unit in which the temperature could be regulated to your liking. My only complaint was the closet had smell of fresh paint so I wasn't to inclined to hang my clothes in there. Many of the guests were mostly of the 20s & 30s range but there were a couple of families staying there as well. The location of the hostel is also really great too. Only minutes from Lincoln Park & North Avenue Beach with about a 20-25 minute bus/subway ride to downtown. Overall, a fabulous hostel in a fabulous city!
