Tour guide Pat M. is verrrrrrry knowledgeable and even more entertaining - what I liked best was that the tour also covered movies that shot here THIS year, LAST year, next month, that sort of thing - much, much more than "here's where they shot blues brothers" - I was impressed - highly recommended, especially for those spring and summer months!
