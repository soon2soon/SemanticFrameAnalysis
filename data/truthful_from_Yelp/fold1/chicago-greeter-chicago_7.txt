Who doesn't love free stuff? .....  ....... *crickets*............. *crickets* Well, listen up, Chicago Greeter is your best deal in the Windy City.  If you book at least 10 business days in advance, they'll assign you a free guide to show you the best of Chicago. You can customize the route based on your interests and get a local's view of the city. We were assigned the lovely Gail, and we emailed back and forth for a while to figure out the itinerary. It was so nice of her to take time out of her Mother's Day to take us around.  We covered Lakeview, Wrigleyville, Uptown (including Argyle Street, which was the original request), and Andersonville.  Lakeview's hipster feel reminded us of Silverlake; we even stopped at Intelligentsia.  The rooftop private clubs by Wrigley Stadium were fascinating. Gail showed us Uptown's charm (you do have to try hard to see it) and we really enjoyed the cool antique/furniture stores in Andersonville. If you're a procrastinator and missed the 10-day deadline, there are Instagreeters at the Chicago Cultural Center who will show you around the loop, yes for free.
