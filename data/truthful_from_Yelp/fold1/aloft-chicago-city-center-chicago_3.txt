I really enjoyed my stay here.  The location was prefect for us-central to many shops and restaurants. The staff at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The hotel was very clean including the rooms. Enjoyed the modern decor.   Although the gym was pretty typical of most hotel gyms, they have plenty of space to move around, which I really appreciated. A few small suggestions would be to get a smith machine and go heavier on the dumbell weights.  They only go up to 50lbs. The restaurant was always buzzing with people; which is pretty rare for a hotel restaurant.  Made me want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about. One piece of advice is to go early for brunch to get a good seat.  It fills up quickly!! Many healthy food options to choose from.  The egg white omelet was cooked perfectly.  However, if you want to indulge, they make their own pastries.  Prices were pretty reasonable as well.
