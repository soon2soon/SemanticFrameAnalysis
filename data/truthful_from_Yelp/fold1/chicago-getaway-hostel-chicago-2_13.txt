This is my first experience staying in a hostel and it has been completely delightful. The Chicago Getaway Hostel is in a great location in Lincoln Park. If you enjoy walking and frequenting public transit, you can get to neighborhoods such as Lakeview and Logan Square quite easily. The park and zoo, of course, are a short walk away. The experience in the hostel is wonderful as well. It's very clean and welcoming. You get fresh towels daily and the complimentary breakfast is very good (hot and cold cereals, coffee, tea, milk, fruit, toast and bagels). There are also personal bins for you to store any food you have in the pantry or refrigerator/freezer. The outdoor patio is beautiful, with plenty of seating and tables. There are plenty of bikes you can rent for a half or whole day. The bathrooms were quite good as well, though the counters got a little grimy by the end of the day. But everything was cleaned regularly, and there are signs encouraging guests to maintain the cleanliness of the bathroom. The showers were very nice, and had shower caddies in each stall for you to keep your soaps and such as you showered. Also, all the guests were very polite and very friendly. I rented a bunk in one of the larger dorms and everyone was very courteous. The staff are pretty hands off, they are available at the desk and are happy to help when you need them.
