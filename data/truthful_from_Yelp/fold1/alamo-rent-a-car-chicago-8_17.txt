Recently got the BEST customer service from a gentleman at the desk by the name of Jarryd Stump- I was told my elite platinum status allowed for free upgrades upon checking out the car and when I called to confirm he was nice enough to reduce my final ticket as I had extra charges that stacked $400 onto my bill!!! THANK GOODNESS I called and reached him bc I was expecting a bill of no more than $800 for a two wk rental and it came out to $1200 bc of extra charges !!! He reduced it significantly! Thanks Jarryd!
