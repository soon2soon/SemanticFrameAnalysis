I chartered the party bus for a company function recently and we had the best time!!!  Our tour guide was Billy and he was frickin' awesome.  Engaging, informative, funny!!!  Learn a lot of interesting facts about Chicago.  I highly recommend them.  So accommodating too!  We needed to make a restroom break and Billy made the bus driver pull over at the nearest bathroom!  Love these guys!  Thanks for making our night in Chicago a very memorable one!!
