I have spent a great deal of time at Midway due to my commute between Boston and Chicago for work. Midway is clean and bright, has reliable curbside service when you're in a hurry, and the security lines generally move fairly quickly. The best part about Midway ,and O'Hare too for that matter, is the extremely easy and convenient access to Chicago's subway. The orange line takes you right to the Midway Airport (the blue line goes to O'Hare). For only $2.50 you can get from either of Chicago's major airports to downtown. This is a great asset and much more convenient than other airports like LGA, for example, where you take a train and then an unpredictable bus to get to and from the airport unless you are able to fork over $30-$40 to take a taxi each way.
