We only stayed there for a night - since our flight out of Midway was canceled last minute. I have to say, from the time I called to my check - in and every interaction I had with the staff, they were GREAT. Very nice, very hospital and willing to help us with everything from our shuttling, restaurant recommendations, helping with our bags etc. They even put out an early breakfast because we were leaving super early (4am) and they had coffee brewed, donuts, fruit etc. If I ever go back to chicago, this is where I will be staying! The room was clean and had great modern touches without the price! LOVE THIS PLACE!
