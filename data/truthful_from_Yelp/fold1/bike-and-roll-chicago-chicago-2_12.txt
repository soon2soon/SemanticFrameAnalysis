What fun we had riding with Todd, our tour guide! This was my Godson's first Segway ride, and he wasn't nervous at all. Todd Â taught the entire group how to ride really well and the seven of us set off on a beautiful tour of Chicago. From the New East Side, along the lake, over to the Museum Campus to 12th Street Beach and back past Buckingham Fountain and Millennium Park. How wonderful to have learned so much about Chicago with a great group and an awesome tour guide/teacher. I'd definitely do it all again!
