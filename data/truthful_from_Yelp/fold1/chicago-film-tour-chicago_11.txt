My family was visiting from Indianapolis and we had bought the Groupons for this tour. Being a huge film fan and recently having moved to Chicago, I was really excited for this tour. It definitely didn't disappoint. Our tour guide was quirky and fun and I loved the nerdy commentary even the few times it was completely over the top. They point out so many locations that I had no idea anything was ever filmed there! It was really fun and educational. I love knowing I live in a city where some really great films and tv shows were created.
