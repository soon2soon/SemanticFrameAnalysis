My wife and i just finished the Grand Canyon tour with Caravan Tours with Kelly Thomas as our tour director. Without Kelly the trip would have been only 1/2 as good. He's a teacher of geology, history, and current events, an entertainer with wit and good timing, and a very caring person. Overall the tour is planned very well with enough time at all the sites and is very good value. Jeff & Katy from Boston
