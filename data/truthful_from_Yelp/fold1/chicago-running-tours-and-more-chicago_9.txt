This is easily one of the best tours I have ever been on! My cousin and I went to Chicago for three days, not knowing much about the city and I left the tour feeling like it was "my kind of town." I LOVED it! The kindness of the people really struck me, and Marlin shines out among them: a big heart and a very kind soul. His story is amazing--I also highly recommend his book. He's run marathons in all 50 states! And the story of this and how it came to pass is so touching and yet hilarious at the same time. I don't want to give it away though! He was very humble about the whole thing, which was also very refreshing. So many tour guides are like robots, and I'm exhausted by the end, but after the tour with Marlin I felt energized, like a dear friend had just given me a personal tour across their city. He even recommended things to do after the tour. He is very flexible, so just tell him what you'd like. After telling him I was an artist, he even surprised us with a viewing of a beautiful ceiling in a hotel I would have never ventured inside were it not for the tour. The tour was full of so many interesting facts, from the tragic to the ironic to the comedic. If you're in Chicago, don't miss the opportunity to meet a friend and learn about this fantastic city.
