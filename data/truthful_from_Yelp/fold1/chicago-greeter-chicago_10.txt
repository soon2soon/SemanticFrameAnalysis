Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled across this amazingly awesome Free tour option for my recent trip to Chicago.  Yes, I said Free!!  There are two different kinds of tours, from what I understand.  There are InstaGreeter tours that happen at specific places and times throughout the city.  Or, if you are anal and plan ahead and just can't stand to be spontaneous while on vacation (like me), you can go on the web page and register for a personalized Free tour.  You do need to fill out a questionnaire with specifics about your trip (dates, ages of people, number in your party, interests, etc).   We were so blessed to have an awesome guide named Mark.  A few days before our trip he emailed and asked specifically what we wanted to do and see.  I asked for a tour of the loop highlighting architecture and history.  I also mentioned that we thought seeing some of the mansions in the Gold Coast area would be cool.   I was expecting a quick rundown of some highlights around the loop, but no, it was an almost 3 hour tour just there.  And then he produced a 1 day pass for the subway for each of us and away we went to the Gold Coast.  It was by far the highlight of our weekend! What really blew me away was that our guide didn't even take the tip we offered him.  He's working strictly on a volunteer basis.  How cool is that?  It really was Free!  Also, when we asked how long he had been doing it our jaws dropped when we learned we were only his second tour!  He was just so personable and knowledgeable.   If you're going to Chicago and have time for a tour (and I'm sure they don't all have to be over 4 hours like ours was) please check this out.  And ask for Mark.  He rocked.
