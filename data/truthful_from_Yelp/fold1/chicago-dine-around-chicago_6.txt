The Dine-Around on November 01st, 2014 was terrific. Brandon made everything from my initial phone calls for information, to purchasing the gift certificate, to the night itself easy, worry free, and enjoyable. Brandon seemed to be "always on" and consistently offered; help, Chicago trivia along the way, and at each restaurant made sure we were satisfied. The restaurants; Quartino's, Francesca's and Riva's offered delicious, and plentiful food throughout our time there. This was the second time "Dining Around" for some of the people in our group, and I certainly can see why. I would absolutely "Dine-Around" again, it was a wonderful evening, thanks Brandon!
