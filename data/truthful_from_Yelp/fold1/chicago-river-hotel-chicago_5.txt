I travel to Chicago often for work, and this has been my favorite hotel to stay in to date. Super convenient to downtown, and very affordable. Yes, the rooms aren't huge, but there are great amenities, including a coffee/tea machine, free wifi, refillable water bottles, and a decent size gym. The staff are incredibly nice as well, and they keep the place very clean.
