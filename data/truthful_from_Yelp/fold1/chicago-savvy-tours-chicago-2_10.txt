We did THE FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT TOUR OF OAK PARK at 11am on a Sunday and George, the director of Chi Savvy Tours, was our guide.  He's gotta be about the best there is.  He was extremely knowledgeable about Frank LLoyd Wright and his speaking skills are excellent.  His descriptions and use of adjectives may be the best I've encountered.  He made history and architecture lessons interesting for anyone that isn't normally into this subject matter.  The Frank LLoyd Wright houses were really awesome.  It was incredible to see his Parie style homes scattered among all the Victorian homes in Oak Park.  It truly is a historical gem and we're lucky to have so close to Chicago.  I would have loved to see even more interiors.  All we saw was the interior of the Unity Chapel-which was neat-but the residential homes have residents so you can only observe from the sidewalk.  Don't get me wrong though, just walking through the historic area of Oak Park and examining the exteriors was very cool.  I would recommend this tour to just about anyone.  I would do it on a decent weather day b/c 1/2 of the time you are outside.
