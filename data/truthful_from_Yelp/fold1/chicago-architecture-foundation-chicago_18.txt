We've taken this tour several times over the years, and it never gets old. This time, we took the 11 am tour on May 27, 2014, and our docent/guide was Adrienne Lieberman. She was the best tour guide we've had: extremely knowledgeable, had a firm command of the facts and even worked in some poetry about the city, its history and its architecture. She hardly took a breath, and used no notes. Amazing lady. I highly recommend this tour for those new to Chicago and those who have been many times. It is an inescapable fact that the history of the city -- and its architecture -- are tied to the Chicago River. Spend 90 minutes on this boat tour and you'll have a great start to your vacation. Members of the Chicago Architecture Foundation get two-for-one vouchers for the river cruise tour. Well worth it.
