I LOVE LOVE LOVE this company!  My husband and I recently wed on a CEBC boat on 8/4.  It started out as a disaster, I booked with a different company originally; after I sent out invitations with addresses I found out through research of my own the company moved without notifying me!  I was a wreck, my invites were out, we had booked everything surrounding the ceremony on the boat and the dock.  I reached out to CEBC in the hopes they could help, they were completely booked on our wedding date but they went over the top and made certian they could accomodate us.  They have THE BEST STAFF EVER!!!!  We had severe thunderstorms delaying our cruise by only 30 mins. The staff was so very helpful and extremely gracious.  They even helped us coordinate walking down the aisle (dock) and timing.  I couldn't have asked for a more perfect setting for our wedding and will be grateful to the staff at CEBC for making it the best day of our new lives together. Not to mention it would be fun just to take an eco-friendly cruise in one of their boats, they are super fun and a great way to enjoy Chicago!
