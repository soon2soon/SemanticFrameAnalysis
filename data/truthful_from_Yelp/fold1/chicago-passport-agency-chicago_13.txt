This is an example of an outstanding and well run government agency with streamlined operations.  What a positive experience that was for me - efficient, professional, knowledgeable.  Not something one would expect of a passport office.  Something to be learned by City and County workers.  If all agencies were like this one, we would be in such better shape.  The manager running this agency should be given an award.  I registered online for an appointment, went the next day, waited less than 7 minutes in line, was greeted by a smiling agent, who had a sense of urgency.  She quickly reviewed all my paperwork, pointed out I could receive a thicker book for the same amount of money, processed my application painlessly, and smiled again.  Then I received a new passport the next day.  NO issues.  Well done, Chicago.
