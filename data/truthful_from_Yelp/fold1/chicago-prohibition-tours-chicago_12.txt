Awesome tour; loved the friendly staff. It's a very fun tour and a must try. They also run the Chicago Pizza Tour. First hand speakeasies, good drinks, and great company. These guys are great at sharing lots of background information, Â and genuinely want to help you find new, interesting cocktails worth their weight in gold. Enjoyable experience and one everyone should experience when visiting Chicago. You can't go wrong here!
