I had never been to an American Hostel and don't know for sure what I was expecting, but, everything was clean, bed was comfy, yadda yadda, what set this place apart for me was the customer service. I dealt with Josh, the GM, who was just so pleasant, funny, accommodating and nice. I will certainly be back. Furthermore, I only stayed there one night--kind of, as I rolled in just before 6:00 am (as per their request, I called to let them know I'd be later than 2, and then again once or twice to let them know I'd be later than I'd let them know I was expecting)--it must be said that I was very impressed by all of the life and activity going on in the lobby when I checked out in the morning. I kind of wish I'd gotten to spend more time there! Anyway, as mentioned previously, I'll get my chance. Thanks Josh and Chicago Getaway Hostel, hope to see you again soon.
