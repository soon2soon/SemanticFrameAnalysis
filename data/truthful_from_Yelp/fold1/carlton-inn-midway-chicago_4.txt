Really excellent service, affordable, clean rooms, delicious Dunkin' Donuts breakfast, and within a safe walking distance to the Orange Line - about a 25 minute ride to downtown. The 62 bus also stops within a few feet of the hotel. The most commendable part is the service - we had a problem with our room, and everyone was very accommodating, understanding, and took care of the issue immediately and gave us a reduced rate for the inconvenience. We also learned that they have a pest inspector come every other week to check for bed bugs (since that's a huge problem in Chicago) and they have many systems in place for preventing the spread of bed bugs. Â  A very excellent place to stay, and I will definitely stay here on my next visit to Chicago!
