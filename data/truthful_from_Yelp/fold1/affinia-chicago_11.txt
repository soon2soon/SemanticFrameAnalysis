Wow. Wow. Wow. I love the "welcome drink" in the lobby- sweet citrus yumminess. I love the extremely friendly staff at the Front Desk, including the young man who took my luggage up to my room. I love the room- the decor is modern but not cold. It's warm and the large windows overlook the beautiful windy city. Simple and iconic pictures line the walls in the room. Reading lights attached on each top side of the bed. And, I certainly love the pillow menu, which allows you to choose from Feather & Down, Sound (you can plug your MP3 in while you sleep), and Magnetic Therapy pillows- just to name a few. I love the sweet chocolates they leave on you r pillow at night. I love the thick robes in each room and magnifying makeup mirror. I love the Aveda Rosemary & Mint bath products. And I love all the food that they catered our workshop with- fresh and delcious. My co-worker and I picked the Affinia Hotel Chicago (all the way from SF) to coordinate a workshop for a bunch of our doctors that we work with. Mainly, we thought the boutique-y-ness of the hotel-not too big or small, but unique and warmly decorated, would suit our needs. Additionally, Erin, in sales, was incredibly accommodating from the first day we spoke with her over the phone. All of our doctors LOVED it. The 2-day workshop was an absolute stellar success. I cannot express how impressed I am with this hotel. Erin & Kila in Sales were organized, Charlotte in Catering was attentive (and her staff-Geronimo, was amazing), and the Director of Operations was incredibly welcoming. The Affinia was the absolute PERFECT venue for this meeting. It is also a perfect hotel to stay at and simply enjoy Chicago. I simply cannot say enough positive things about this hotel- I beyond highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip or business function in Chicago.
