My husband, a friend and I all bought a Living Social Deal to do this tour.  It was the first time for the other two, however I had done a tour before with a different company so have a good basis for comparison. First off, our tour guide Matt was great.  Before we set off, the lock to the shed where the Segways are kept had broken, but Matt was great about it and got it sorted so we had hardly any delay at all.  He kept us updated and kept his composure throughout.  I think we left only a few minutes later than planned in the end. Each person was trained how to use the Segways individually, and there was time to practice and get acquainted with them before we set off for the tour. As we made our way down the Riverwalk and along the Lakefront down as far as the Planetarium, Matt had us stop at several locations where he spoke about the city, some history and gave us some interesting facts!  I have done many tours of Chicago in the last year, and was surprised that Matt told us things that other tour guides had never mentioned so it remained interesting!  Although Matt was really nice, fun and friendly, he still remained professional and made sure we were all safe throughout. I wanted to compare this Segway tour with the other I did with a different company last year.  The two tours cost the same price, however this tour had no hidden charges (the other tour made us pay quite a bit extra for insurance for tires, punctures and damages).  This tour was longer, and we covered a lot more distance on the Segway.  The guide was more informative and had a geniune interest in Chicago.  He was geniunely a nice guy and not "fake nice" trying to get tips like the last tour I did. Overall I give this tour 5 stars - it was good value, Matt was informative, professional and fun, and the whole experience was great!  I would recommend this tour to any of my friends and am planning to go back and do it again at the end of the summer!
