My friends booked a suite at this hotel for a bachelorette party through an online deal. I was staying on in the city afterwards and needed a room for one night, so used Hotwire. When I saw I had booked a second room at the Affinia, I got nervous: What kind of terrible hotel participates so enthusiastically in these rock bottom online sales? I needn't have worried. The Affinia offered us big, clean, modern rooms in the heart of downtown Chicago. The bachelorette suite comfortably slept 4, and we were able to get a cot for an additional nightly charge. My king-bed room the next night was similarly attractive and well-stocked. I would stay here again in a heartbeat; this was a steal for the location and the quality of the rooms. My only real complaint about the hotel is there was frequently a long wait for the elevator. Get on that, Affinia. If I stayed here again, I would like to try the house restaurant, C-House, whose head chef is Top Chef All-Stars winner Marcus Samuelsson. While I've heard mixed things about the restaurant, I get food-star-struck.
