Boat tour was wonderful, weather was a bit overcast but allowed buildings to be seen without glare. The tour guide was a very knowledgable former architect that also knew a lot about engineering. Perfect amount of time (90 mins) to see all the major buildings of Chicago. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Chicago that is interested in architecture. The tour gives you a chance to enjoy the view at a nice level (elevated from street view) and then you don't have to worry about walking into people/pedestrian problems.
