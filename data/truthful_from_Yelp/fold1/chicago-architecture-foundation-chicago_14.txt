The 90-minute river cruise is a great way to learn about Chicago without doing the legwork and provides great views of the city that may be elusive on land. The volunteer docent expertly narrates the engineering and background of all the architecture along the river. Because of the live illustrations accompanying the facts, the cruise was very engaging and interesting than simply visiting a museum of its sort. It might get a bit breezy on the river so a light jacket is recommended. Also, remember to bring your sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen!
