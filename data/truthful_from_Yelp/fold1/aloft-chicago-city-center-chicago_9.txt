I spend 100+ nights a year in hotel rooms,  most SPG.  This is hands down the best SPG property in downtown. I love this place for 5 reasons: 1) service is impeccable.  They  are always amazing.  Noteworthy that they don't treat me special because of status.   They do it for all. 2) great river North location 3) Beatrix,  their restaurant... "oh my Carmel pie"  enough said 4)pool table in the lobby and amazing gym downstairs 5) rooms are comfy and clean
