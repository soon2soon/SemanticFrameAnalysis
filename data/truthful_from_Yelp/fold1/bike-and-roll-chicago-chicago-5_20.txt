We had bought a Livingsocial deal for a 2.5 hour architecture segway tour, and we had a FANTASTIC time. We had a great tour guide by the name of Jack. He was very pateint, attentative, and knowledgable of the city. He made sure everyone was having a good time, took his time and didn't rush anyone. He was even kind enough to take a girl 7 pictures in a row (we know how that goes). He made sure everyone was individually comfortable with the segways then led us on our way. He made sure to take breaks and let us stretch out our legs. He brought us in perfect timing to the Buckingham fountain because he knew at the top of every hour the fountain shoots water, so he had us there in time to see it. He also noted to us which areas we were coming up in that had a lot of cracks or holes. He was amazing and made our trip very fun. He also made sure to learn all of our names. THE BEST! We enjoyed it as a family outting and would recommend it to everyone.
