I rented a car at Midway Airport to attend a wedding and returned it to Midway.  The only glitch I encountered was that they did not have a full size car, which I had requested.  Neither did they have a luxury sedan instead, which would have been my preference.  However, they gave me an SUV, which was okay. The car was fine, the people were very nice, the service was efficient.  I have no complaints and would rent from them again.
