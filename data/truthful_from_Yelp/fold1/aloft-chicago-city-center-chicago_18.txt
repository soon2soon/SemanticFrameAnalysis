Amazing staff! The hotel welcomes you and makes you feel very welcome, everyone has been extremely nice and friendly. The beds are AMAZING and so comfortable. The doorman was great at getting us a cab, when we were having some trouble. The location is perfect, great places to walk around. The elevator is key card access only, making you feel safe that not everyone can walk in. Off the street. The restaurant Beatrix had just as friendly staff. Highly recommend the hotel! :)
