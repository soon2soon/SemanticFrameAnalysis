Review is regarding a segway tour. I had found a great deal on Livingsocial.com for a 2.5 hour segway tour months ago.  It was a great deal.  Reserving my space was very painless.  Just follow the instructions Bike and Roll emails to you.  I had received my confirmation within hours. Checking in was a breeze.  Just go to the lower level of the building, and check-in.  The young man behind the counter was personable and pleasant.  So far so good. Matt, our tour guide, was very going easy going when he met our group.  There were nine of us on this tour. He demonstrated how to use the segway and then give us individual time to get use to the segway. I will say, I was a little unease in the beginning but once I got use to the segway, it was cool.  Within minutes, it appeared that we were all comfortable on our segway.   Kudos. Then our tour began.  We zoomed along the lakefront, the DuSable Harbor, made a stop the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, continued to the 12th avenue beach for a rest stop.  Each stop, Matt would check in on us and give us facts about what was are viewing.  On the way back, we zoomed around the base of Soldier Field which was so cool, stopped at Buckingham Fountain then back to the starting point.  I wish the tour was longer. For an unique way to see the city, take a segway tour.  So far, I have had very good luck with this company for renting bikes and now a segway tour.
