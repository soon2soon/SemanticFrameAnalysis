Margaret Hicks is one of the most incredible tour guides I have ever encountered. She has a contagious enthusiasm and is full of wit. I went on her Boystown Tour a few years ago. Now, I live in the neighborhood and wasn't expecting too learn too many new things, but she really surprised me with a fascinating tour full of historical facts and anecdotes. This girl can make anything interesting.
