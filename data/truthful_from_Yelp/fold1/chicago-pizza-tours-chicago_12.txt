A must if you are in town for the first time. We did the night time Pizza & Cocktails tour. Our tour guide was Kevin, the owner's brother.  He was a real cool guy, funny, and informative about not just pizza but the town itself. The pizza stops were well thought out, adding a bit of every kind of Chicago pizza. The group for the night time tour was relaxed and cool, as I would imagine most groups for the evening tour are there for a good time.  I wish we had done the tour earlier in the trip because we made some friends along the way. You will be stuffed and it will be money well spent.
