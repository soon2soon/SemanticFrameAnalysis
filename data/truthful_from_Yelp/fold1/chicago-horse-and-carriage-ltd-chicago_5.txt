Everything was perfect.  Our driver was awesome and had a great sense of humor.  Took a 30 minute coach ride and stopped to propose at a mansion in the Gold Coast.  Would highly recommend buying tickets in advance as the cash wait was over 2 hrs long.  With advance purchase we didn't even wait 20 minutes.  Coach was clean and cozy with blankets.  There is a Ghirardelli across the street from the start position and I highly recommend getting a cup of hot chocolate for the ride.  They were polite and perfect.  Will do again and a perfect way to propose!  Thanks you Jen!!
