Very pleasantly surprised!! It was more than we expected. We would have never walked that far and we saw a ton of stuff in the two hours. Kim was an awesome guide too! Saw Soldier stadium, couple parks and got down by the water. Â Highly recommended. I will be looking for a Segway tour in the next big city I visit!
