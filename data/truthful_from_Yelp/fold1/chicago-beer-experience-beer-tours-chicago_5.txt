This is a must if you love beer and want to experience Chicago via the eyes of a beer-lover!  We took the Lakeview and Lincoln Park tour on a sunny Sunday afternoon. It's worth every penny and you'll want the tour to go on for another 3 hours.  I don't know what else to add that my fellow Yelpers haven't covered - you'll get to try a wide variety of beer, enjoy tasty treats with your libations (including BACON), learn about beer and Chicago, and have fun with your tourmates and guide. The tour also helped me realize I actually like Guinness - it's all in the proper pour! Oh, and FYI yinzers, there is a Steelers bar in that neighborhood!
