I loved this hotel! I booked studio suite for one night and it was amazing. I took a red eye from LA, arrived in Chicago at 5am feeling dead tired.  When I called Affinia, they let me check in right away (usual check in time is 3pm).  I walked into the room not expecting much since I paid $120 for this room but I was surprised by such a huge room.  When you walk in, there's a desk, walk down 3 stairs, then a large living room that leads into a bedroom with a large flat screen TV that you can swivel around.  Decor's modern and comfy.  Although no free wi-fi, you can pay $10 for unlimited internet.  They have top chef Marcus Samuelsson's C-house restaurant in the hotel, Gino's East right next door, then Neiman Marcus and rest of stores on Mich Ave just one block away. What a fantastic deal! Definitely staying here again next time!
