I had the pleasure of going on the Chicago Pedway Tour offered by Chicago's Finest Tours and it was EVERYTHING! I learned so much about the city of Chicago, its history, fun facts and not to mention the awesome pedway! I found out about this tour via Groupon. They were offering a 2 for $24 deal which I totally could not pass up. After reading the stellar reviews on Yelp & Groupon, I figured it would be worth $24. Boy oh boy, this tour is worth much more than the $24! Booking and paying for the tour was simple and easy. The day before the tour I received a reminder email with all of the information we'd need for the tour. When we arrived for the tour, we were greeted by Dan, our tour, guide who was very warm and friendly. Not to mention extremely organized which I absolutely loved. While waiting for the tour to begin, we were offered complimentary cookies and soft drinks. Dan began the tour at 1pm sharp. He gave us another warm welcome and introduction along with a brief overview of the tour. During this time, he passed out headsets and maps so that we could follow along and hear him clearly during the tour. After that we were on our way... I won't spoil the tour for you but I will say that the Pedway is pretty awesome! With it being less than 30 degrees outside, it was the perfect way to tour Chicago since we never had to go outside. The Pedway was completely covered and indoors which was pretty unbelieveable. Dan was the best tour guide we could've asked for. He was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and quite entertaining. His excitement for the city of Chicago and all it has to offer was completely infectious. Next time I'm in Chicago, it'll be summer time and I plan on doing another tour or two with Chicago Finest Tours. I've checked out their website and saw that they offer several other tours like a brunch crawl, pub crawl, roaring 20s tour and more.
