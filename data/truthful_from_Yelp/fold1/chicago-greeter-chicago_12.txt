I highly recommend!  Where else can you get a free, walking tour of a place of your choice/interest in Chicago? Not only that, but the tour guides they set you up with are not only knowledgeable and fun, but also very passionate about what they do.  I had reserved a time/date and had a tour guide all to myself.  We walked everywhere, saw beautiful sights and I learned a LOT about the city. Definitely gave me more appreciation for Chicago and helped me to "see" things I would have usually skipped over.   I definitely recommend taking this tour toward the beginning of your Chicago trip.  I did and I think that helped me to enjoy my trip even more.  Cheers to the city of Chicago for supporting such an amazing service!
