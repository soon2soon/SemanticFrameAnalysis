I wanted to make sure I didn't grow a third nipple after being exposed to the waters of the Chicago River, so I waited a couple of weeks before posting this review.  Not having experienced any adverse effects I can now give the kayaking adventure a solid 5 stars. The whole experience was fun from start to finish.  The staff at CRC&K were very personable and efficient in providing quick training on kayaking techniques.  Of course, not much kayaking skills are required on this mild river.  Paddling against the current is a bit of a work out and I am glad we went upstream first.  That enabled us to coast down later with only a little bit of steering to avoid cantankerous ducks. I would highly recommend CRC&K for an active adventure in the city.  And should I start sprouting any additional limbs, I promise to immediately update this review.
