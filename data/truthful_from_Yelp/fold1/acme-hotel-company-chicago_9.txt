This was the hotel my company booked for me when I traveled to Chicago for a few days, and the accommodations made my work trip so much more pleasant than I expected. The room was essentially immaculate the entire time I was there -- the housekeeping staff are really meticulous and clean everything, from the gorgeous wooden floors to the sink and shower. The bed was incredibly comfortable, with spotless linen and six(!) pillows to cuddle with after my long hours of work. Free wifi, a delicious West Town Bakery in the lobby, complimentary Lather products for the bathroom, even a chalkboard on the door! The hotel also offers complimentary coffee delivered to the door, which was a true godsend considering how early I had to get up -- you just have to request it each evening for a certain time, and the delivery person taps lightly on the door when it's there. Bliss. For that alone, I will demand the Acme Hotel for my next work stay.
