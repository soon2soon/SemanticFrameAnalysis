We had just a walking tour in downtown Chicago with Eric. It was focused on favorite /traditional Chicago foods that we were going to try. We not only went to regular places offering pizza, hotdogs, beer, but also to a magnificent buildings like Chicago cultural center and Palmer hotel (for desert). We heard fascinating stories and the amount of food was just right. Great value! Â I will definitely use them again.
