I took the Historic Pedway tour in Chicago recently and can highly recommend it to anyone who loves history.  The tour guide gave us a wealth of information on Chicago and the early history of including the Columbian Exposition.   There was walking with minimal stairs but very doable for any age Our tour guide was funny and friendly and seems to love his job.  Go if you have the chance. One thing...make your reservation early since the Saturday tours fill quickly.
