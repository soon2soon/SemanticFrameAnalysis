The Allegro was an excellent hotel to stay at, especially while on business! The decor is excellent in true Kimpton fashion and it is a source of entertainment just checking out the different areas of the lobby. Tons of amenities, and I was lucky to have been upgraded into a top floor suite. Super comfortable, clean, and free Wi-Fi when an InTouch loyalty member (so sign up!!). Nightly hosted wine hour is a great touch, definitely enjoyed winding down here with colleagues after a long day. Location is excellent - theater district within walking distance to Michigan Ave, State St, and next to the El. I was lucky enough to run to the amazing Macys on State Street and wished I could have spent more time there! Highly recommend the Allegro to anyone visiting Chicago!
