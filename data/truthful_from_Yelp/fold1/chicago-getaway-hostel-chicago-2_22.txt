SO CLEAN! Great price and location. The staff is friendly and they offer a bunch of breakfast in the morning as well as lots of fun activities. This is clearly managed well. Best hostel I've been to across the country! In case you are coming with a car, plan to rent a parking space from them because there is literally NO STREET PARKING anywhere near here. So don't even think about trying to find any. I am staying in an 8 bedroom all female dorm and surprisingly have had no problems with the bathroom being shared! Crazy. My first night here a bunch of friendly Brazilians were dancing and partying in the main room and invited me to join. Very friendly, fun vibe here. The only thing I would recommend are bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper like me. Lots of doors slamming and the people in my room getting up and leaving/coming in -- typical for any hostel. I like that the common rooms are far from the dorms which makes the party noise too far away to hear. I am staying on the L level ( the basement) and love it. Very clean and also the air conditioner/ heating unit is excellent.
