We signed Chicago Dine Around for our Wedding Rehearsal dinner for our 45 guest event and taking our friends and family to our favorite restaurants.  I want to say that Brandon and crew did an amazing job with organizing and operating everything.  Considering all the logistics of the undertaking, everything went off without a hitch.  Chicago Dine Around are very professional and I would recommend them for any event or to any one of my friends or family.  Everyone has to try this at least once!  Great way to see Chicago.
