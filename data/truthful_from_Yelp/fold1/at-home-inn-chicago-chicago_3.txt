I cannot say enough good things about At Home Inn Chicago.  They saved our vacation!  Thursday night of Memorial Day weekend our previous rental fell through and I suddenly needed to find a space to accommodate seven adults (five beds) for five nights.  We started looking at 6pm, and needed to be in an apartment that night.   When we called At Home Inn Chicago their offices were closed, but I took a chance and called their emergency number.  The woman couldn't have been more helpful.  She found us two apartments in the same building, in our desired location (Lincoln Park), with two parking spaces for our vehicles.  We were able to book and get the access information for the building immediately.  When we had questions, she was incredibly responsive.   The apartments were wonderful - newly renovated, we were the first people to stay in them post renovation.  There were plenty of towels, blankets, and pillows for our large group and the kitchen was well appointed.  The neighborhood was fabulous, we were within walking distance of a number of great restaurants, bars, and shops, and public transportation to downtown was easy.  I would definitely use them again.
