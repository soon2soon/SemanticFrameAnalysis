FREE.  Yes, Free. We had John give us an hour walk in 2hrs.  He said when the hour was up and told folks that needed to leave that they should head on out but he'd continue talking until either he was done or no one was there to listen. Such great stories of the history of Chicago.  He grew up on the streets and could really make us see and feel the bygone days. Not only did he take us to and into the buildings in downtown Chicago, he had photos to help illustrate his points. Quick pace.   Lots of beauty.   Lots of history.   Lots of great stories.   Free. Chicago Greeters rock!
