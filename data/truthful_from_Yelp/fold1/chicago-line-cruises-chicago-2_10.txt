A tour unlike any we've ever been on - Far and away the best way to see the city and in a way that's unique and will leave you both wanting to do it again and with a new appreciation for Chicago and all the great architecture that makes the city what it is! This two hour tour, complete with coffee and cookies, was simply stated - spectacular. The tour guide did a great job of pointing out literally every building that had any history associated with it - granted could have been lying and we wouldn't know the difference. Either way, it was very thorough and on a sunny day it was an incredible way to spend a late morning after grabbing breakfast downtown. Cheaper to book online and it was the best way to make sure we got on. It's located in a bit of an awkward spot, around the block from where our GPS took us. It's back behind the buildings that sit on the water. This is the sort of tour we'll be recommending to our friends and taking ouf family on. Hands down the best way we've seen a city in the US - great photo ops, great guide, and a great way to spend a weekend morning.
