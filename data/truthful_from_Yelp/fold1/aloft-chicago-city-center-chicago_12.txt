Excellent  hotel. I've stayed at this property serval times and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago or looking for a getaway if you live in Chicago. Fantastic friendly staff provided great service and accommodated my every need and request. Great location within walking distance to  everything you need: shopping, restaurants, Magnificent Mile, the Lake/Beach and more. Red Line Train 2 blocks away. Stylish and clean trendy rooms. Complimentary Wifi. Cool lobby. Beatrix is a cool  open and airy restaurant off of lobby: great for people watching,  brunch, lunch, dinner or cocktails.
