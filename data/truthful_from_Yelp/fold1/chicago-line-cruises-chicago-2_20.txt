This was a great tour, we loved it! My husband and I took our soon and girlfriend, everyone enjoyed it. Takes about an hour and half but gives you a lot of great information and facts about the city's architecture and the history behind it. Keep your cameras ready because it does move a little fast for picture taking. The complimentary coffee and cookies are nice and the staff is friendly. I also liked that the boat was not as large as some of the others who offer similar tours. We found the docent to be engaging and well versed. He took time to incorporate the passengers, made jokes, recited poetry and even sang to us. All around it was a great tour and we Â recommend it to anyone.
