The restaurant and lobby area is very nice, and Rich at the front desk put me into a beautiful room in the tower area, moving me from the room that they had set up for me in the "low rise" wing. One hint - if you are attending a meeting in the AMA building next door, it's much faster to walk across the parking lot than use the bridge.
