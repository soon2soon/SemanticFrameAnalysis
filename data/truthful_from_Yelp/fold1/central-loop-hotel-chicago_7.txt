I LOVE Club Quarters!  When I travel (for business, in particular) I don't need unnecessary frills.  So at this hotel I get a spacious, comfortable bed, an adequately sized bathroom, free Wi-Fi, and other basic necessities (TV, desk, closet).  I don't pay for unused square footage or ridiculous amenities that I have no intention of using.  (Very European!) I also love the fact that Starbuck's is next door and a vegan restaurant (Native Foods) is right around the corner.  I'm within easy walking distance of key Central Loop locations (Art Institute, e.g.), and the price is unmatched, at least based on anything I've found in Chicago. I recently had my second stay at the hotel in a year's time, and I never plan to stay anywhere else.  It's clean, check-in is easy (staff are ready to help with the self check-in), and the room is secure. If you're looking for luxury, then don't stay here.  But if you want a clean room to sleep in, then this is a perfect choice.
