Oooo the humid weather, the sweat down my cheek, with the wind through my hair and the ring ringly ring of my bikes horn. Nothing says best tour ever than getting there on your very own two wheeling shiwn deluxe bike while soaking in some sun fun and info from your very own very informative tour guide. Lots of fun, lots of information and when they say ridiculously easy, they mean it. I'm thinking of doing another tour which is 22miles than the 7mile one I did today. Register online n you get a 10% discount and park at AMC parking structure they validate it which will only cost $16, cause the park n go on the street has a 2 hour limit, n the tours last as lil as 3hrs. Happy Biking!
