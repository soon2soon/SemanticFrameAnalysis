Took the underground tour today and was quite happy with the experience.  Liz was our tour guide and she really seemed to enjoy her job.  She was knowledgeable, upbeat and funny, kind of like having a good friend showing you around the city - very laid back- which I like.  On some tours, they go on a bit too long, but not the case here.  My wife and I actually learned something new at each stop.  We will definitely have to book again with Savvy Tours next time we are in Chicago.
