The Chicago Passport Agency is located on the 18th floor of the Kluczynski Federal Building. The office is used mostly by those who need their visa or passport paperwork expedited. For example, one lady there today was FREAKINGout because she needed a visa for a Cambodia flight a scant four hours hence. Its best if you make an appointment in advance. Upon arrival your documents (application, pictures, itineraries, etc.) are checked for completeness. If you've got everything, you're given a number and asked to take a seat. When your number is called you have a consultation, pay the bill and are given a receipt and a pick-up time. $170 for an expedited passport renewal. The office is set up for efficient flow with two check-in counters and a dozen workstations. There are federal security agents all over that place - two when you get off the elevator, two in the office, five in total within 30 square meters. The gent helping me today was smart, helpful and fast. Apparently this is normal here. The Federal building was completed in 1974 and named in honor of Illinois Congressman John Kluczynski. Like much of the architecture in Chicago, this 45-story glass, granite and steel building is no slouch. The surrounding plaza is also quite nice and contains a Calder (Flamingo) - also completed in 1974. In my travels I'm sometimes asked to document where my passport was issued. It was kind of cool visiting the place that I've noted so many times in so many places.
