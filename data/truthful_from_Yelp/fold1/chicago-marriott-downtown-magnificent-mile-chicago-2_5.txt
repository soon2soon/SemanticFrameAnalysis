This hotel was excellent. Right in downtown and close to everything you can easily walk to destinations and back. There is a Starbucks right downstairs. The front desk is very small and every morning the check in reception area is flooded with people its very small and tight spaces. There is 3 elevators depending on how busy the wait times can be long. The two beds room was huge and spacious we had requested a top floor and the views were nice. Excellent value and quality for Marriott hotel standards. The lobby had a sitting area was nice to sit and drink your coffee in the evening and look outside. The free WiFi was excellent and super fast. The service from everyone there was perfect. I would book this location again for the goodness it offers
