A functional, efficient, and professional government office staffed with competent and polite employees.  I'm pretty sure those words have never been used in the same sentence.  But believe it, yelp friends, this place is fantastic.  After procrastinating renewing my passport for too long, I needed to get it done on the quick and this is the only place (locally) that will get it done (within 2 weeks of your travel date, they check for proof!).   I made an appt and had all of my documentation in order and was in and out of there in less than a half hour.  Unfortunately, I had to come back the following week to pick it up, but my butt didn't so much as hit the chair in the waiting room before my name was called and I was handed my crispy, fresh passport.  Everyone was really nice to work with from the security screening folks downstairs to the guards patrolling the 18th floor to the peeps behind the glass.  If only all government offices could function like this one...
