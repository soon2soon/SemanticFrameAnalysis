Perfect location just a few blocks away from the heart of Boystown!  Beautiful courtyard at the front entrance, great modernized rooms, comfortable bed, nice big tv, fridge, Keurig (or however you spell that) coffee maker in room, nice large and well lit bathroom.  Free Wi-Fi and some office services and a decent complimentary breakfast (it's free, so you really can't be too pick).  It's a little more expensive that I prefer to pay, but I always stay here due to it's convenience and customer service.  Parking garage next to hotel can have the overnight parking price associated on to the check-out bill.
