On August 18th my girlfriend and I did the Wicker Park food tour. Our guide Aaron was very friendly, very knowledgeable of the area, and is great at storytelling. He helped make the experience that much more fun. We started at Glazed & Infused donuts & finished up at Alliance Bakery with other great places in between. We enjoyed the tour enough that we did the River North food tour on August 31st. Again we had Aaron as our guide, and again he didn't disappoint. That tour started at the Donut Vault & ended at Forever More Cupcakes, again with other great places in between. Either tour is worth going on & Aaron is worth requesting as a tour guide.
