My husband and I came to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary so when we saw this Groupon for the movie tour of our favorite city, we jumped on it. Not being from a big city, we rode the Metra into town and were late arriving to the appointed time of 10:30. I emailed John and he was very accomodating to allow us to join the 12:30 instead. We truly enjoyed everything about the tour-the fact that we could see the movie clip and then see the actual site was perfect. Patrick is a fantastic tour guide and so knowledgeable about all things cinematic. We have told all of our friends about this experience and we hope to come back with our kids so that they can enjoy it as well. Thanks so much for making us love Chicago even more than we already do! Great job!!!
