We took the Historic Chicago Pub Crawl Walking Tour with Elizabeth on 3/21/15. She was very knowledgeable and the tour was fun and interesting. She did a great job of keeping the group engaged and moving along without feeling rushed.  We learned so many things about the area.  I would definitely recommend this tour, and I will be looking into other options with them the next time I am in town.
