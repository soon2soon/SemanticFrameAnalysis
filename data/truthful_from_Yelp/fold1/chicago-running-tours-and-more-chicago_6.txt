I am so glad I got out of bed at 6:45 on Easter morning while on a weekend getaway. I was so tempted to skip out, but it ended up being my favorite activity while in Chicago. I wanted to get a run in while in Chicago, but the busy streets and my poor sense of direction made me leery of running on my own. City Running Tours was a fun, informative, safe way of exploring a city while running. Blake was a great guide, was friendly, knowledgable, and made sure to ask if the pace was comfortable for the two of us on the tour. A lot of reviews mention photos and an email with a recap of the tour highlights. I believe Blake did mention that he had a camera with him but he never took it out. He did, however, take a couple still photos of me when I asked with my phone. I am sure if one of us had inquired, he would have taken some running shots with his camera. It was a gorgeous morning for a run through Millennium and Grant Park. I was really hoping to see Buckingham fountain flowing, but it is under repair and still not open for the spring, bummer, but no fault of the tour.
