Wouldn't rent from anyone else. $16 a day during thanksgiving and a free upgrade to a better car can't be beaten in Chicago. I arrived via train and, due to O'hare's confusing signing regarding the rental car shuttle, took a bit to find where I was supposed to go, but one I did, it was a breeze. We were all picked up in a rather nice shuttle with a friendly driver. After a five minute or so drive, we arrived. I had no bags so I was first off the bus and was in my car in no more than five minutes. The agent was friednly, but I could tell he knew everyone was busy and wanted to get to their families, so he wasted no time. I was in my car and on the road in no time. due to the lovely traffic on the Dan Ryan, I ended up returning the car an hour or so late and was not charged any additional amount due to traffic being so crazy around the airport. Ultimately, Alamo gives you the price of a cut-rate rental company with the service of an elite one. Will rent from them again
