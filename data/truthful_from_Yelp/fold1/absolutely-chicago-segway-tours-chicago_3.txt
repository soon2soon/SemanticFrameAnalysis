Definitely the way to tour the city!!!! We did the park tour which totally does not just include the park... You go all over!! Â This company was great and our tour guide (Josey I think... The one with the Afro) was awesome. Super friendly, informative and all in all lots of fun. He took pictures of each group at the stops and was very patient and kind when people looked frazzled on their Segway. He knew what he was doing and was confident which made us all feel at ease. We want to tour every city on a Segway now! :)
