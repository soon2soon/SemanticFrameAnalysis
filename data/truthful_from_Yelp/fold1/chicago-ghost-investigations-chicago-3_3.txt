Whatta night! The staff is kooky but cool. The best part - they don't hover over you (like the ghosts do)! You're free to roam with your homies (and swig your flask if you must)as the four hours fly by (like the ghosts do)! We had two crazy encounters with spirits! Even the non-believers believed! Do something different tonight!
