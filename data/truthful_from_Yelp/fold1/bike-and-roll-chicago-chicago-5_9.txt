Never rode a Segway before, but at age 65 why not try it?  It was EASY!!!  If you can stand, you can ride one of these.  But the best part was discovering parts of Chicago we hadn't seen before on the Segway Architectural tour.  Tour guide Roberta told us about many interesting details of Chicago's history and the buildings, and the ride was so much fun, we can't wait to do it again.  I'll definitely make this a must for out of town guests, this is the way to have fun!  Posted June 14, 2014
