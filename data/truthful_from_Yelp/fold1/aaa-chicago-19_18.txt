I've been an AAA member for 37 years.  Some years I don't use the service, but it is a wonderful thing to have.  I recently locked my keys in the trunk of a rental car and Hertz wanted to charge me $200 to come out.  I called AAA and they were there in 30 minutes and got the car unlocked.  When we did not find a trunk release by the drivers seat, they crawled through the pass through to get to the emergency release in the trunk itself and we found my keys.
