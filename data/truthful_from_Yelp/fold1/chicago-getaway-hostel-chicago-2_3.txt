Let's be real, hostels aren't the Plaza. So reviews need to be in context to what you are reviewing. Stay was February 2015 for one night. With that said, this hostel gets a 5 Star from me for many reasons. Let's start with: It's clean! The private rooms are more than enough space. I was lucky enough to have a room to myself with my travel companions, and it was plenty warm and comfy. Is the bed as nice as my bed at home, of course not, but again, for a hostel, it's amazing. They had plenty of resources and things to do, like a little library and community piano and guitars. Loved that. It was super close to great food and the parking lot was just what these weary travelers needed. The thought of trekking from a parking spot far away to where we rested our heads was terrible, especially because it was NOT warm out. Plus, the free breakfast in the morning was such a bonus. We got this for just shy of $40 per room. Amazing! But here's the reason it really gets the 5 STARS...Their service was IMPECCABLE. Langston, Colin & Matt were hands down the best hospitality service providers I have come across in YEARS, anywhere. They were friendly, funny, knowledgeable of the area and Chicago, and just what we needed after a very long day of travel. They went above and beyond to accommodate us. For instance, I was traveling with two men. The two men got one room, and I another. They made sure to keep us on the same floor so I wouldn't be far from them. Not because I asked, but because they were that good. I love nice hotels, but for one night for a trip on the fly, this was perfect. Especially because we were on a budget. I really enjoy the small business touch you get here. I really look forward to another visit to Chicago, and you can bet I'll be staying here again. Thanks guys for all you did to make our stay comfortable. You're the best!!
