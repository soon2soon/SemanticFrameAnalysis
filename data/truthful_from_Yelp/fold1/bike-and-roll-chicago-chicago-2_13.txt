My husband and I took the Sunset Segway tour (with a Groupon) and I must say that this was the BEST Chicago tour I have ever taken. Quinn, who is wonderful and funny was our guide. He started off by teaching us how to use the Segways, which he allowed a half an hour for. Then, afterwards, we toured downtown on them. We went through River North and along the lakefront, to the bandhsell, through Soldier Field (which was beautiful in the evening), and into Grant Park. Quinn took the time to let us take photos, took photos of us, and allowed us enough time at each site to get a thorough look at everything. The full tour was almost 3 superb hours. Although your feet are a bit cramped afterwards, it is well worth it. Bring a jacket if it is a cool day though, as it tends to be more windy riding around the lake. I would do this tour again even without a Groupon. It is very well worth the price.
