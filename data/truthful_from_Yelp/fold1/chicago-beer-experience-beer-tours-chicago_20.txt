We participated in the Bucktown/ Wicker Park beer tour and we had a great time. Our two tour guides were knowledgable and humorous. My only general observation is that your tour experience will vary depending on the other people that also participate because you will interact along the way. The fellow tour takers in our group were friendly and welcoming so it wasn't a problem at all.
