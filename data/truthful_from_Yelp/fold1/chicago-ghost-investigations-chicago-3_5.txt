We had Allison as our guide and we loved every second of the tour. It was really unique and we enjoyed it alot. Allison was fun and helpful through the entire tour and we will definitely return and recommend it to our friends and family. We did catch some abnormalities on our cameras and had some amazing experiences with the equipment. Even the skeptics in our group had to admit that they could not explain some of it. I had a great time and would definitely come again in the future. I found out I attract a ton of activity so that was awesome to see!
