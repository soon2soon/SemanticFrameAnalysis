I was in Chicago for business for 2 weeks and my company put me up at the Allegro. Because I was there for so long, the staff cleaned out the mini bar so I could use the fridge and hooked me up with a coffee maker and microwave. They really went out of their way to accommodate me during my long stay. I was in a larger suite with a separate living room area and walk in closet. It was quiet and comfortable, I didn't have the problem of thin walls like some other reviewers. The fitness center is also pretty awesome. It's basic equipment, but it's all new, clean, and maintained. I was kind of obsessed with the treadmills that played music videos (my fav was the 80s high energy channel). Â I did think it was weird that the lobby was actually on the second floor, but the staircase is so pretty who cares??
