We booked a tour last minute, as we sort of stumbled on Chicago Detours while looking for things to do while my in-laws were visiting during the cold Chicago winter.  I have to say we were really impressed and pleasantly surprised with how much we enjoyed our tour, and especially our tour guide Elizabeth.  She was knowledgeable, friendly, and very enthusiastic.  My in-laws thought the tour was the right amount of content and length and definitely enjoyed the historical aspects.  We did the interior architecture tour but I could definitely see us doing some of the other tours that the group has to offer in the future.
