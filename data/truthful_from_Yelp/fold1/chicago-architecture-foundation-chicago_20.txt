If you do nothing else, do this!  Regardless if you have lived in Chicago forever, or just visiting, this is the best way to see the city.  Comfortable seats on board, full bar...and very upbeat, interesting and well educated dosen's.   You won't regret this tour.  By far, best cruise on the river.  We live nearby, and still do this once or twice a summer.  Do not miss this!!
