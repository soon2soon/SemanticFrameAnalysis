I met with Don about going for a ride with my wife who was meeting me downtown after work. Don came up with the idea and was right on cue. Don picked us up right after dinner at Catch 35 and offered to take us to the fountain, but after a few drinks and dessert, we were ready to head back to the car. Don was very respectful of his horse and made sure to wait for all lights if they were about to change to not stress out his horse. He was very respectful of both myself and my wife and I will not hesitate to ride with him again. I will admit that some guys that work out there look like they don't care much about their horse, but I work close by and see the relationship Don has with his horse's (not the same one everyday) and how he allows kids and passer-bys and opportunity to interact with the horses. If you are looking for a good wind down to a romantic night... look for DON!
