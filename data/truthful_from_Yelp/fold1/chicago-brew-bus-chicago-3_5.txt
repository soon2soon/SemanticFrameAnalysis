As the manager of one of Chef Rick Bayless' restaurants, I have to teach a beer class to the staff of all three restaurants every year.  This year we planned a visit to 5 Rabbit Brewery as part of that class.  It almost didn't happen due to transportation issues, but then these guys got involved.  Big thank you to Chicago Brew Bus.  They made it all happen professionally and it was so much fun.  Some of our group are already making plans to use the Brew Bus again.  I know that the next time our restaurant staff visits a brewery, we will definitely be going with the Brew Bus!
