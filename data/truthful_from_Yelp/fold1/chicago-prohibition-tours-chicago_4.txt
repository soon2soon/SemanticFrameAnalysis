Made a little weekend vacation to the end of a work trip. We had never been to Chicago before and were overwhelmed by the amount of guided tours available in the city. Many other ones were sold out already, but I feel we lucked out with this one. Being a historian and all out history nerd, this is what the hubby and I do on vacation, get in the local history of any place we visit. I have gotten into some serious arguments with guides and docents in the past, and there were no problems here. The guide seemed to have really done the research, not just providing local myths and hearsay. The guide was very colorful, very bias on some issues, but it provided great entertainment. Loved all the bars we went to, each provided something different and had completely different atmospheres. The tour included Green Door Tavern, Marge's Still, Club Lucky and I can't remember the last place we hit. It was not as interesting as the rest, seemed like it could be a bar anywhere. Highly recommend. If we had anything like this in Houston, we would take it all the time!
