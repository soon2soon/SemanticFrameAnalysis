My wife and I were in Chicago for a long weekend and decided to try something different.  We both love beer so we decided to try this tour.  The reviews really lived up to their hype.  It was a great time and the 3 hours just flew by.  Our tour guide, Ryan, gave us the history of Chicago's beer past as well as his own experiences in home brewing.   It was a lot of fun.  The places we visited were diverse, from an Irish Pub (props to Tony, who gave us great Guiness!) to a former speakeasy.  We also loved the bacon beer bar.  I could easily spend 3 hours in any of those places.  We drank plenty of beers, some I preferred more than others.  It was also nice experiencing some of the lesser-travelled neighborhoods of Chicago to avoid (most of) the tourists. My favorite line of Ryan's from the tour was his explanation of the how yeast does its thing:  "They eat sugar and they fart carbon dioxide - it's a magical process!" Thanks for a great afternoon.  And for the beers!
