I highly recommend this service. We rented single kayaks on a Sunday afternoon, received some simple instructions and set off. It took us about an hour and a half to get to Lawrence and back, during which time we saw a turtle, many ducks and several different species of birds. I was a newbie, but had no problem controlling the kayak, and, surprisingly, was never in danger of falling in. I'll wait a couple of days and change my review if I suddenly become extremely ill from being on the Chicago river.
