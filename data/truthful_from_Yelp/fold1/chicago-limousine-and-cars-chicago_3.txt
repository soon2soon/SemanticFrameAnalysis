This is the only car service company in Chicago I use. They are always reliable. I am even given the option of having the driver text me before I land and, after grabbing my luggage, I text them back with my door number. Within a few minutes, they are outside meeting me. In today's world, it's much easier to communicate this way to avoid an extra phone call. The vehicles are always spotless! The drivers are always prompt, if not early before the scheduled pick-up time, and always get me to my destination safely and quickly. I have enjoyed them so much that I opened a corporate account with Chicago Limo and they are the only service our employees and guests use while in Chicago. Not only have I booked with Chicago Limo for my airport transfers, but I have used them constantly for special events, weddings and birthday parties. I highly recommend this company for all your transportation needs.
