Fabulous experience! This is a four star hotel with five star service. The room was clean, updated, and very quiet. Plus, the bed and pillows were soo comfortable. I loved the dog friendly policy and the staff's attitude towards our furbaby. The yoga mat in the room along with fitness channels were a nice touch. Also, we loved the wine hour. I see some reviews indicated that the walls are paper thin... we could hear some muffled noise as we walked thru the hall, but the air running in the room kept it quiet and peacful.
