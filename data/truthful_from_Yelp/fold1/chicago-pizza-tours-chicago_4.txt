I loved the tour. The host was funny and knowledgeable and always had a funny fact or statistic about pizza to share. We hit some nice places (Pizano's, Flo&Santo's, Pequods Pizza, Pizzeria Serio) and could try a variety of pizzas (tavern style thin crust, deep-dish, neapolitan thin crust) with different toppings (sauerkraut, sausage, giardiniera, mushroom). I think the tour is a great way to explore the city a little differently than usual and to try more than one pizza. Since Chicago is not only famous for its deep-dish, it is nice to have the possibility to try it all without having to buy a whole pizza every time. Plus, when trying the pizzas in such a short time, one can really see, feel and taste the differences. Also, I enjoyed the company of all the nice people in the group. I was the only one that came alone on the tour, plus the only foreign person, everyone else was from the Chicago area (more or less). So, this was even more interesting and I really liked socializing with the people in the group. They made me feel at ease even though I was the only lonely traveller. I never felt left out! Well, to finish off. I simply loved the tour and do think it is worth the money. Got to go to some places I would probably not have tested if I were to decide alone where to eat my Chicago pizza (because the places we went to are not the most marketed ones) Enjoyed the overall experience a lot and would recommend it to everyone. Fun fact: It was pure luck that I stumbled across this tour on Yelp while looking for restaurants to eat my deep-dish pizza at. Glad this happened!
