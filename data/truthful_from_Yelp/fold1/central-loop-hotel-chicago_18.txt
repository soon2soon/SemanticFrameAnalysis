Clean, wonderfully located, very helpful personnel. Less than five minute walk to/from subway to O'Hare, less than ten minute walk to Symphony, Art Institute, Millennium Park. Walked back alone from bus stop on State Street at 11PM and there was enough street traffic so that was OK. Highly recommend! Hannah Diozzi, Salem MA
