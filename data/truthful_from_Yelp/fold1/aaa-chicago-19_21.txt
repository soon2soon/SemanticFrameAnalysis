This location has it all. If you are a AAA member, all you have to do is flash your card to one of the associates and they will help you plan your travel as best they can. They have maps (depending on the destihnation both local and state maps), tour books, guides to certain parks, discount coupons, and more. Â I am planning a trip to San Francisco/Napa/Yosemite and was able to get maps, tour books, and guides! Totally worth the annual membership I pay to be a AAA member. Unfortunately this location is open M-F 8:30a-5:30p and is not open on weekends.
