Three friends of mine recently bought a AAA membership due to few times I have required roadside service and just called AAA and magically they show up and resolve my problem.  I even had a friend call me when she was in a car pickle and asked who she should call.  I said I call AAA, however since she wasn't a member; I had no clue who could help her out.  Getting a membership is just good smarts.  Not only does it help when your car is being pesty, if you utilize all the discounts available at hotel and retailers, if pays for itself.  Another nifty perk is they will send you destination guides and maps if you still like going old-school.  Also, the membership covers me the person, not car, so if I am in my friend's car and it breaks down, AAA will come!  Lastly, the last two times I called for service, the fellas that came were super upbeat and nice.
