There was a great groupon deal on a "Segways at Sunset" tour so my boyfriend and I decided to do it and I'm so happy we did! We had Joe as our guide and he was great. I had been on a segway before so I went last but he did a great job on instructing people how to ride. Once everyone was comfortable on the segway we were off. We stopped every once in awhile to stretch/ take pictures and he talked about really interesting trivia/history tidbits. I live near Chicago and learned a ton about the city! Overall a great experience!
