Their architectural tour is hands down the best in the city! Their staff is really professional, fun and knowledgeable. The boat and seats are very comfortable. I've had the pleasure of being on their smaller, more intimate boat, and the larger one--both are great and provide superb, nearly unobstructed views of the beautiful city. I got TONS of great photos! Their tours are guided by extremely knowledgeable members of the Chicago Architecture Museum (or Society?). Our tour guide was super informative, engaging, witty, fashionable and surprisingly funny! She even knew some of the architects about whom she spoke. As stated on their site, they offer complementary tea, Starbucks coffee, water, lemonade and cookies (or muffins) which are super fresh and delicious. I'd recommend this tour to anyone who's looking for a fun, informative experience learning about Chicago's rich history.
