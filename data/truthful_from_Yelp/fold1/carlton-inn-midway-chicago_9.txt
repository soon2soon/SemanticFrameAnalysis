The Carlton Inn Midway is an amazing place to stay. They offer free shuttle to and from Midway and are right next to the orange train line for simple access to downtown. The train is within walking distance, but the shuttle will take you back and forth. I don't think the neighborhood is that bad, but some may feel unsafe during the block or so walk. A security guard walks the premises all day and night. Continental breakfast is large, including DD breakfast sandwiches. The cost of the clean, spacious rooms is modest and the customer service is always spot-on. When reserving, I would highly recommend requesting a room that is not in the back of the property. The small number of rooms back there do not face the street or parking lot. They face the backside of another row of rooms. Difficult to explain but if you ensure your room door faces the parking lot/Archer St. you will be fine. That other row of rooms is just not as nice and they charge the same price as the other rooms. The staff is excellent here. They are all so nice and helpful. I do like staying downtown, but if I don't need to stay downtown I will always choose The Carlton.
