I recently took the Chicago Pedway tour with Margaret and had a blast!  Margaret's enthusiasm and love for the city was evident right from the start.  I was part of a group of retired teachers, out for a day in Chicago, and we enjoyed this tour very much.  Margaret gave us so much insight into some of the unknowns of Chicago.  Great knowledge of our fair city!  I highly recommend Chicago Elevated for anyone who wants to do something out of the ordinary while having fun learning about Chicago from the pedway.  You will love Margaret's sense of humor too!
