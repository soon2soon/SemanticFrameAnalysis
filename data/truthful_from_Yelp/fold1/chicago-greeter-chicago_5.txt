Chicago Greeter is the best kept secret. Go to their website, sign up for a tour and be ready to be amazed! Pam was our tour guide and I couldn't have been happier. She showed us everything that we wanted and more. I would have never thought to look inside of Macy's to see the beautiful restaurant up top, get free samples from the chocolate counter, get free coupons from the machine in the basement and see the wonderful architecture.
