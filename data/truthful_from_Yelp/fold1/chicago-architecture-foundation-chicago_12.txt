My favorite thing to do in Chicago.  The tour never disappoints.  The guides are so knowledgeable and chock full a tidbits.  Be sure to go to the gift shop before, after, or anytime you don't take the tour, because it is a perfect non-touristy spot to find Chicago gems.  You won't find gifts like this many other places in the city. Go on this versus any other boat tour.  The others are cheesy imitations.
