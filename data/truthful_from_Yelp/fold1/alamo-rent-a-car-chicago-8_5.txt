One of the smoothest check-in and outs I've ever had! I was a pre-paid order off priceline, and everything went smooth. Also if you get the toll transceiver it is a flat daily rate for tolls- a great value. They couldn't find an economy car, so upgraded for free to standard- still got decent milage.
