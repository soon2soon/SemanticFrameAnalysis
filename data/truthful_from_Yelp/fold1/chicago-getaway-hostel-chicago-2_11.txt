we stayed here when looking for apartments and jobs in the city in order to move. ive never stayed in a hostel before but this one changed my mind. it so so clean, the staff was helpful and friendly, they even have events at night for guests to go out and have fun. so cheap, and safe. a great choice. reminded me of really really nice college dorms.
