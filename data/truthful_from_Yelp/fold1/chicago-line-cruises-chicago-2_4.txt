Whether you're a native Chicagoan, a newcomer, or a tourist, I can't recommend Chicago Line Cruises highly enough to you. The views of the City are spectacular! Perhaps the most beautiful views of our City to be found. Bring your camera! (Your real camera with a zoom, not just your phone.) On a pretty day you can't take a bad shot, even with an inexpensive point 'n shoot. There are no bad seats on the cruise. Every passenger gets great view. You can go below deck if the wind gets too chilly or the sun too hot. No matter which cruise you choose, architectural or historical, you will learn boatloads of fascinating information about Chicago. Using Chicago's waterways and structures as visual aids, your docent will recount the story of Chicago's rise from a muddy, marshy backwater to the wonder of architecture and commerce it is today. The Chicago Line Cruise docents seem to be encyclopedic on the topic of Chicago and are good storytellers; able to hold the attention of audiences of all ages. I recommend both tours and try to do one or the other every few years. There is some overlap between them -- you can't discuss Chicago's architecture without discussing its history -- but the focus of the tour and parts of the cruise route differ. The architectural tour explores more of the structures along the Chicago River, including the north and south branches of the river. The historical tour brings sightseers out into Lake Michigan for a view of the Chicago skyline. Cruises include snacks, soft drinks, tea, and Starbucks coffee. Cocktail cruises are available.
