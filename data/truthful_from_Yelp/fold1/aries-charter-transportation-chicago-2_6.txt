I have used Aries countless times for charter and transport for special events and weddings and swear by their customer service. Bar none they are the most professional company I have dealt with for everything from an employee outing to Ravinia to bridal party transport.  Their drivers are courteous and prompt and their equipment is immaculate.  Not only that, on one occasion when we had a logistical problem, Aries did not see it as an opportunity to gauge us but actually went above and beyond in helping solve the issue by being flexible with our contract.  Its customer service like that that makes me feel so strongly about recommending them. Rates vary but are by far the best quotes out there and they deliver on all counts.  If you are looking for an inexpensive alternative for large group transportation, I would highly recommend Aries. I have never had less than a perfect experience with them!
