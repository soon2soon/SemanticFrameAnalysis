I was freaking out to find my passport expired as I have a business trip abroad next week. I called the number last night and made an appointment for renewal, the earliest available was six days away.  Still, I felt nervous that I was cutting things close and showed up at about 1 pm today, six days before my appointment day. They allowed me in. The deciding factors on whether they let you in without a scheduled appointment on the day you show up are: that there are no long lines; that you have an appointment confirmation number; and your trip is within 2 weeks. If it's after 2 weeks, they are less inclined to admit you. Anyhow, it took all of 10 minutes and they told me to come back for my passport next week, on the day of my scheduled appointment. What a relief. Have your paperwork complete, photo, old passport, ID, payment, and it's a breeze. I love this agency. They're super-efficient, so friendly and helpful, and give Government a good name.  No need to go to private rush services. This agency will get you your passport without the private upcharge. Also, please be aware, since the agency is in a Federal Building, take off pepper spray from your keychain, pocket knife, weapons etc and leave them at home. Security won't allow you to carry them through and there are heavy fines.
