This was mine and a friends first time staying at a hostel in general. Let me say that this experience was amazing !!! This hostel is located very close to the subway and local transit. There is foodies nearby and some goodies around the area. The hostel is well located in a quiet neighborhood and is on a very quiet street. I like the security features on the access to the hostel you need to have a key card to get inside. Upon entering the hostel it looked very modern and hip the reception was warm and welcoming. The room we booked was a private bunk bed with a sink and a toilet. Our trip was in May hot weather apparently and they had AC in our room and a ceiling fan which was an A+. The hostel did events daily which we were invited to but we never joined because we pretty much did out own thing. Missed breakfast on the 3 nights stayed but McDonalds was well close to the hostel. The shared bathroom and the floor we were on the highest floor 4th floor was super clean and well maintained by the staff. The shower had good supply of hot water and right amount of pressure. One tip would be to install a hair dryer for men yes we do out hair too and also the paper towels needed to be refilled as well!! The room itself was clean and nice for our liking we like the private rooms better.. The beds were actually comfy. The sheets were okay. The towels were a bit scratchy worn out but OK for a hostel stay. Overall the facility was maintained well and the staff are well trained helped us get tickets and good recommendations... Next time I stay in Chicago I'd definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family. Thank you Chicago getaway hostel your truly the #1 experience we had in Chicago !!!??
