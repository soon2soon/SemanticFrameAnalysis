Fantastic time!!  I have been on this tour 3 or 4 times and it is always outstanding.  The tour guides are super knowledgable and friendly.  They talk for the full 90 minutes and you dont even realize how fast time goes!! I like to sit in the middle section on the top on a nice day.  You can see 360 degrees around you.  Get there at least 30 minutes before the start of your tour or you will have to sit below.   Can't wait to go again next time I am in town!!!  Thanks guys!
