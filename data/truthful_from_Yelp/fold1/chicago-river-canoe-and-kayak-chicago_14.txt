My friend and I ended up renting a tandem kayak at the lagoons launch.  The guy running the location, Ryan, was extremely upbeat and enjoyable.  He gave us a pretty good idea of the area we'd be paddling, and we were off.  During our 2.5 hour excursion, we traveled twice around the island directly in front of the launch, as well as a bit further north.  We spotted a turtle and tons of herons.  We even got to observe a heron as it caught and ate a fish, which was really exciting.  We were hoping to see more wildlife, but it was still a worthwhile trip.
