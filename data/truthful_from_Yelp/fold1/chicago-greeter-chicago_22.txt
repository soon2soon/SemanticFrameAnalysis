The Chicago Greeter program, located in the Cultural Center, is great.  The best part about it is that greeters are volunteers and they have an excitement and passion for the city that is remarkable.   I believe that weekends get busy (I got lucky when I came unannounced on a weekend) so I would advise calling ahead.
