I cannot say enough good things about Chicago Majestic Limo.  We first starting using them when our son started college at the University of Chicago.  Each time we visited Chicago, we relied on Chicago Majestic to take us to and from our hotel to the airport.   They also provided rides to our son from the airport to Hyde Park when he would return to Chicago from a holiday or break. Last week, our son graduated from the University and we needed transportation, not only for ourselves, but for family members, all of whom arrived on different days and at different times.  We also needed transportation to and from the University for the different ceremonies and events, and, transportation to and from restaurants.   Lisa was tremendously helpful in getting all of the different rides scheduled, at the right times, in the right size vehicles.  And of course, as these things go, some of our needs changed almost on a daily basis.  But each time, Lisa cheerfully accommodated us.   Without Lisa, this would have been a stressful time for me.  But with Lisa's help, everything went off "without a hitch".   And our driver, Joe, was just wonderful.  He is so friendly and professional.  Every one of our family members just adored him.   The vehicle was always spotless and in excellent condition.   Chicago Majestic is an excellent, customer-oriented company and we recommend them to everyone who has transportation needs in the Chicago area.  (Our son now has a job in Chicago, so we will definitely be using them many times in the future.)
