The folks at Alamo are wonderful--especially Stephanie Mustafa--and I highly recommend them if you need a rental car in that region. Here's why: Until now, I had never had a bad experience renting a car. So my encounter with Hertz at Midway Airport was a very unpleasant surprise. We had pre-paid the full cost of our Hertz rental through Hotwire before we arrived in Chicago. In short, we paid for two rental cars and Hertz oversold their fleet so they had no cars available. In addition, we checked with several other rental car companies on-site who were also out of rental cars. When we got to Alamo, Stephanie was kind and quickly checked the garage to be sure of what vehicles were available. She then explained our options and got us into an alternate rental car and on our way in short order. Even the Alamo garage staffer was great, helping us load heavy luggage into the minivan. In a separate Alamo experience, my Dad arrived a day earlier and also rented from Alamo. For some reason, he needed to switch rental vehicles and, in transferring to an alternate vehicle, he left a very important bag behind containing his tablet and other expensive items in the original rental car. Two days later, after many calls, Alamo called to say the items were located. Dad was very grateful to get those items back, and while I don't have all the details on that one, I know he also worked with Stephanie Mustafa to recover his things. Alamo was VERY helpful in getting us into an alternate vehicle and in helping to locate a lost bag of expensive items. Many thanks to Stephanie and the rest of the Alamo team!!!
