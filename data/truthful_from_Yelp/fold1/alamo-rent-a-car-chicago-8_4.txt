Two friendly drivers to and from the Alamo rental location to the terminal were wonderful. Â "Don't leave Chicago without trying our famous deep dish pizza!" The very friendly employee that helped with the kiosk, and allowed a SUV upgrade from a compact car at no additional charge made me an Alamo fan, big time. Clean new car, great gas mileage, and amazingly wonderful customer service made car rental here a very easy and enjoyable experience.
