Our guide Nancy was a true 8-decades of Chicagoan and amazing. It was sweltering hot and she was able to keep us indoor/underground for the most part while still giving us interesting tidbits. We saw some beautiful mosaic work, enjoyed a river view and tasted some chocolate. Lastly, she shared with us beautiful view of skyline from her private residence's rooftop. We would highly recommend requesting for Ms. Nancy if possible!
