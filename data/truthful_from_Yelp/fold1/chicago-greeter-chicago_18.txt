we decided to book a greeter on a whim, even if it sucked it would be a funny story. but it was AWESOME and FREE! our greeter was a college aged girl named Kim. she knew a lot of back story and history about different monuments and storefronts. we walked all over the place but the tour was so enjoyable that we didnt even realize how far we had walked and we're surprised how fast 2 hours passed. also, they give you a free day pass in case you need to ride the bus as part of your tour.
