I don't love beer. I don't get all hopped up talking about hops. Or barley. Or yeast. Or fermentation. However, I was pretty interested in finding a unique beer experience for hubs' bday, so off to Yelp I went and Chicago Beer Experience Tours is where I landed! We had an ale of a good time! Bruce, the owner and our tour guide for the 3ish hour escapade, was truly fantastic. You can tell this guy loves his beer, Chicago history and showcasing some very unique bars. During our Bucktown/Wicker Park tour we checked out Lottie's (originally opened by a 6' transvestite named Lottie who had ties to the mob), Lemming's (new local art on the wall every month), Silver Cloud (neighborhood staple) & Emporium. I was able to sample (3-5 oz pours) 13 beers, 11 of which I've never tried before! Even my husband who is far more beer savvy had only tried 3 out of the 13 beers on the tour...so that's saying a lot! Additionally, there were a few snacks along the way, including a Chicago dog from George's and a tasting from Silver Cloud's (amazing) chicken pot pie. Even if you're like me and you haven't the knowledge to distinguish a pilsner from an IPA, this beer tour is super fun.
