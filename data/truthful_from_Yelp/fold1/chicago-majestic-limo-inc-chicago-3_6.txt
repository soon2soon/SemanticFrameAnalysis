Where do I begin with this review!?! I have used Chicago Majestic Limo for 3 years now and mainly use them for business travel to and from the airports. They have been always on time, flexible, and the best rate around. My travel plans change frequently and they are always accomdating. Lisa is just a gem, and she makes me part of the family. While I have a few drivers, I do have a favorite and would recommend him... his name... Joe! Always is friendly, professional and makes the ride go by quick, but also knows the boundries in the event that I am just too tired, or have a call. Never had a problem nor do I ever see a problem occuring.   Friends have used them for personal use for local events, and parties and never had any problems. Seriously, you cant go wrong!  Ask for Lisa when booking and request Joe for the driver, seriously!
