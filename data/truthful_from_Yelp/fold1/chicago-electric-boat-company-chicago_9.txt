I am sure your experience depends on the people you bring with you. However I was very happy with the management ( Eric ) being very helpful in rescheduling due to storms. The location is a tad tricky to get to, but if you make it to Marina City right by House of Blues, take the elevator down and find their little office where the Yacht sales office is. The little boats felt new, sturdy, and drivable. I didnt have to know a thing about them to understand how to control it. The north branch is quiet and peacefull but with less to see. We didnt have enough time to go far south so be early and get going on time! They have ice and coolers so bring your 6 Packs ( driver, no drinking!) bring food! they have a couple tables on board. Very roomy, covered and clean boats. I would go again when the weather cools off a bit! The only thing is that the boats are slow, yes they are electric and I dont expect much, but you have to be tactical in the busy parts of the river so you dont get run over by the Wendella guys.
