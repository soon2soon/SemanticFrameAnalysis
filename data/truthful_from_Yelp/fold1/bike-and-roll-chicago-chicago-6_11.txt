This was an awesome way to see Hyde Park and the lakefront. Our tour guide was so energetic and helpful as we got acclimated to the segways. Vincent was a wonderful source of architectural and historical information. I would highly recommend this tour. So fun to zoom around and see a beautiful part of the city!!
