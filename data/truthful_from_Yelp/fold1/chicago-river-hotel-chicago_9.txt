Just came back from Chicago and I stayed here. So glad I made this choice. The check in was prompt without much fuss, staff was friendly and the room was clean and modern. Yes, it was on the small side, but hey- it serves its purpose: you are in a quiet, central and clean environment, perfect for business or fun. In fact I didn't want to leave. They have a great lobby with internet on first and second floor, where you Â will also find complimentary coffee, tea, fruit and snacks every morning. Quite a convenience I would say. You can also have your tea or coffee in your room. The welcoming message on the phone was a nice touch too. Oh, the best part? The super comfortable bed and linens. I would come back for those 2 alone... Did I mention free WI-FI? Enjoy your stay!
