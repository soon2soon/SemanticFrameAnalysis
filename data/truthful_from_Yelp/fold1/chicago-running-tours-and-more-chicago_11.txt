I really enjoyed the Navy Pier tour.  Luckily I was the only person that signed up because I'm a very slow "runner".  I audibly laughed when I read a previous reviewer saying they're a slow runner at 11:30; that would be me on a very good day.  But Marlin didn't make me feel bad when I had to walk a few times.  The photos are great and Marlin was extremely knowledgeable about the city as well as additional sights to take in.  Due to some personal issues Marlin did not have the shirts (which I did want) with him but it was an honest, legit reason so I won't hold that against him or the tour.  If you're a runner I would definitely check it out!
