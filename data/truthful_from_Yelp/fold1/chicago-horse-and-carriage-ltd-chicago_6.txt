After having a wonderful experience with Gold Coast that operates about a block away, we decided to take the Chicago Horse & Carriage Ltd. tour from the Water Tower during a quite nice afternoon (see photos).     As you can see they are waiting at the Water Tower, and you select the first Carriage in line.    Our driver did not take credit cards, cash only, but the price was very reasonable.   (About $80 with tip).    And after getting addicted to these rides a few months before when taking a different company home to our hotel, this time we wanted the whole enchilada.   We asked for the longest most wide ranging tour they had, and they took us all the way around town, with the driver giving us notes, very laid back voice tour.   And then we clopped all the way down the Miracle Mile and the waterfront.     The cars and cabs are surprisingly respectful to the Horse and Carriage (something you would never find in Houston) haha, and we had an absolutely wonderful time.      This company that always has a line up at the Water Tower (see our photos) comes with our highest recommendation for anything on Yelp.    Very, very solid 5 stars.    Totally excellent.     Lifetime memory to be made here for under $100.    Bring your camera!
