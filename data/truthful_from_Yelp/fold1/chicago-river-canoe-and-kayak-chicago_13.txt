Good times! Affordable fun close to home. We rented a tandem. I recomend renting a single for each person, tandem takes a lots of time to figure out. With a tandem you might be zig-zagging and arguing about which way to go. Staff is friendly, small operaton, was not crowded for a nice Saturday afternoon. We saw geese, blue heron, fish (was thinking about the song "summertime, ....fish are jumping") some other stocky heron, and mallards. It was nice to do something a bit different. These people do a great job, highly recomended!
