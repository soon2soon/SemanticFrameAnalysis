This review is a little overdue. I stayed at the aloft the week it opened and had a great experience. The staff was incredibly helpful, some of the best hotel staff of any Starwood I've stayed at. The location is perfect in river north, and the hotel itself is one of the better alofts that I've stayed at. It's a shame that someone reviewed this place 1 star because they don't like the concept behind the chain. Sure, its tough to stay here for more than a few days on business because do the closet layout, and the materials are definitely on the cheaper end. I personally love that everything is easy and functional, down to the wall mounted shampoo dispenser (much better than screwing around with silly travel bottles.) What really sets the aloft apart is the energy that you feel from the moment you step into the lobby all the way up until you go to bed. It's like they took everything fun about an upscale European hostel and added the comfort of a modern hotel.
