The Caravan team was super organized in planning my trip- a 10 day tour of Costa Rica.  I traveled during the month December courtesy of my Wheel of Fortune experience and had a most memorable time in this natural paradise.  They were a pleasure to plan with and were A-mazing from start to finish.  They offer a variety of all inclusive tours in natural paradises throughout the US, Canada, Mexico, and more. Prices are affordable and you can opt to price your trip according to the "Value" dates price table and occupancy rate.  Fantastic accommodations, dining, and service.  Great for friends, families, coworkers, and colleagues. If you're single and want to travel, you'll enjoy the privacy and alone time you crave while getting a healthy dose of interaction... you'll be in good company on this trip. Caravan gets my stamp of approval- highly recommended.
