Although we live in Chicago, we decided this would be a fun activity with my parents while they were in town this past weekend.  AND it was! We did the Bucktown/Wicker Park Experience.  Neil was a great guide- he was easy going and extremely knowledgeable on all things beer and Chicago.  Highly Recommended!
