Around 10PM the night before an international trip, I realized my passport wasn't not going to be valid for entry (the country required 6 months validity, and I only had 3 months left).   As my flight was only about 20 hours away.... it was too late to do the express turnaround services (and pay a small fortune). I started panicking thinking I would have to cancel my trip, when I stumbled upon a review for the Chicago Passport Agency. I called the Chicago Passport Agency for an appointment, and it said the earliest availability was 2 weeks from now.  However I called back again and instead selected a specific date for an appointment (as opposed to the earliest available option) and I was able to secure a 9am appointment.   I frantically called CVS/Walgreens in the area to see who had a photo department still upon for passport photos at that late hour, and luckily I did find one that was open. Based upon another review, I went to the agency very early (6:45am) to be the first in line.  I was surprised to see there was already 10 people in line.  Note:  They do not let you sit on the floor, so be prepared to stand while you wait!    By the time the office finally opened at 8:30am, I would guess there was probably 100 people in line. When the office opened, I was one of the first people to be helped, and they told me to come back at 1PM to retrieve my passport.  I went back to my apartment to pack my suitcase, and came back a bit before 1 with my suitcase in tow.  They had my passport for me, and I went directly to the airport! I have never written a yelp review before... but felt the need to write this as I am SO thankful to the Chicago Passport agency that they were able to accommodate me and save my vacation!  They were very courteous and made me feel at ease, which was much appreciated in a time of great stress!
