We had tons of fun riding Segways and will definitely do it again. I was nervous but our instructor took plenty of time to teach us how to operate the machines. Â Once everyone was comfortable, the tour began. We are somewhat local to the city, but saw parts of Chicago on the tour we'd never seen before ... the Gold Coast, a wooden street, mansions, beaches ... It's hard to remember it all! Our instructor's name was Kim and she was awesome! She was patient, funny, and knowledgeable. Hope she's still with this company when we tour again. I'd request her as our instructor, although I'm sure the others are just as good. There are a lot companies who offer Segway tours in Chicago. I'm so glad we chose Absolutely Segway Chicago. Loved it!!!
