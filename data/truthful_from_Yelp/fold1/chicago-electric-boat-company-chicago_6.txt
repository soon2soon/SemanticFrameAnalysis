SO MUCH FUN!! A group of friends and I purchased an online deal for a 2 hours boat ride. There were 10 of total which I will admit was a little tight but still a good time! The 2 hours was just the perfect amount of time. You are able to bring your own food and drinks on the boat. Can't wait to do it again!
