Absolutely love this place!   I found Acme through the Hotel Tonight app, I made my reservation through the app and showed up at the front desk 30 minutes later.  The Staff is AWESOME!  Alli (Ally?) at the front desk was super nice and helpful and personable. So now the rooms, I have stayed at many hotels where they give you their best pictures on a website and you get your room and its nothing like what they show.  So being as I got my room through a third-party source I was skeptical.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The room was just as fun and quirky as the photos!  The room is very clean and modern.   The location is easy to access and around many restaurants and shops.  I think my only complaint is parking, there is a parking garage next door you can pay $40/night (because you know...Chicago).  But it doesn't have direct access to the hotel, so you either take the elevator down and walk around the block or walk down the driveway to the Acme front door.   Overall I love this place, I will recommend it to my family and friends (as they can see from the pics I have put all over my Facebook page and Snapchat) and will stay here again! Can I give more than 5 stars?
