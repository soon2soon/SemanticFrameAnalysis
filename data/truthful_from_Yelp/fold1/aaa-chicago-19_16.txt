I've had AAA ever since I've had my license....thanks Dad! I've used them on occasion the past few years, as my Jetta is approaching 100,000 miles. This evening I had by far the best service yet. My car overheated in a parking lot while I was doing errands, and Andre arrived shortly after my call to tow me to my mechanic. He was polite, very personable, efficient, and provided some great advice about my car on the ride to the mechanic. Thanks Andre, for turning around my stressful evening. You rock!
