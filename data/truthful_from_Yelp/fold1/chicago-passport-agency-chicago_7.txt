Ditto to what everyone else said. If every government agency was run like this one, it's Â incredible how friendly, efficient, and positive life would be. Thank you, Chicago Passport Agency! Like many, I didn't realize until last minute that my passport was expired. It's as simple as everyone says, although it will cost you for the last-minute process. Oh well, now I don't have to worry about it for 10 more years!
