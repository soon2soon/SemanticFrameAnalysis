We went on the Chinatown tour today with Lisa and had an awesome afternoon!  Not only was the food delicious, but we learned a great deal about the history of Chinatown and how Chinese culture has influenced its cuisine.  In addition to sampling dim-sum, the heat of Sze Chuan cooking, and sweet-and-savory Peking duck rolls, we visited a Buddhist temple, specialty Chinese grocery stores, and the lovely Ping Tom memorial park.  The tour opened my eyes to different foods as well as the neighborhood, and I will certainly be visiting Chinatown frequently with new appreciation!  Lisa is an incredible tour guide - friendly, knowledgeable, and fun!  I would highly recommend Food Planet's Chinatown tour and hope to try the others in the future.
