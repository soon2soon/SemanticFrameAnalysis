I took the Great Neighborhoods bike tour just before Labor Day.  Devin was our tour guide and she was fantastic.  Devin is knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  Our group of 5 started on the Chicago River Tail and then hit the Lakeshore Trail.  Stops included the beach, Lincoln Park (Zoo and Conservatory), the Lilly Pond and in Wriglyville.  It was my first time on a bike in 12 years and I had a blast.
