I was in love with this hotel when I first saw the website. Was asking around for funky/unique hotels to stay in while in Chicago and ACME immediately soared to the top of the list! If ACME were a person, I would totally hang out with them on a regular basis. They took the whole theme and just ran with it, and absolutely knocked it out of the park! It was funky and functional, and exactly what we were looking for in terms of having a hotel experience rather than just staying at your normal boring hotel. So what did I love the most? Everything! The decor in the room - hand print on bed, zipper on wall, lipstick nightlight on bathroom mirror, raining shower head, oh man everything was just AWESOME! The room was small for hotel standards but it was completely functional in terms of having so many items usable. We absolutely didn't need any more room. My boyfriend loved being able to stream his Apple products on the various items available. The robes were a nice touch and probably got the most use out of everything in that room! The knock and drop coffee service was great, and the coffee piping hot and delicious! While we didn't use the facilities on the lower level, we walked through and saw the gym, sauna, etc and they looked great! The location was perfect and so close to so many things. We easily strolled through the neighborhoods of Near North, River North, Gold Coast, and over to the Navy Pier. Extremely easy access to the El, just a block away from the red line. Price was within our range at under $200 per night, so it really was exactly what we were looking for in terms of the total package. Couldn't have been happier with our stay at ACME!
