I'm giving this 5 stars relative to what it is: a clean, well-run hotel in the Loop at a moderate price.  You can't compare this to hotels that are more expensive or to hotels outside of downtown that have bigger rooms.  I'd stayed previously at the Red Roof Inn, and this was definitely leagues above. Room was newly painted, clean, functional. Staff very professional and helpful.  No complaints at all!  People said room wasn't big enough for a couple, no idea what they were talking about.  I liked the free filtered water too.  Will stay again!
