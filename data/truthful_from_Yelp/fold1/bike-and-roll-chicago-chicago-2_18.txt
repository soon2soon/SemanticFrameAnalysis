Did the Segway tour of the lakeside with Jack and Joe. Did a groupon value for two. Good tour of Chicago around the lake and park. Straight forward and fun. Gave decent info at various spots. Provided ponchos in case of rain but did not rain. Check out site for more tours and other rentals. Recommend.
