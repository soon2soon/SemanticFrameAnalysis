We completed an Old Town/Gold Coast tour on Friday. Tour guide was Angie, a five-star guide. She was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. She kept the tour at a very good pace. Wasn't slow. Wasn't fast. Just perfect. She remembered it was my husband's birthday and surprised him with a candle and treat at the end of the tour. Super sweet and thoughtful. I highly recommend this tour for first timers in Chicago. We were. The tour was a perfect blend of the city's history mixed with food history. We loved it. Learned a lot. Food portions and variety was on point. Value of food compared to cost of tour was worth it. We had such a good time we will do another tour the next time we visit. Our goal is to take all the tours offered.
