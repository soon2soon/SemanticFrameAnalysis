This tour exceeded our expectations and was worth every penny. If you read the instructions emailed to you after you purchase your tickets you will know what to expect and what your tour includes. We met at the first bar and the bus drove us to three others throughout the tour. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and told a great historical story that was easy to follow (even after a few drinks!). We were impressed with how much we learned and were able to take away from this. I HIGHLY recommend this tour!!
