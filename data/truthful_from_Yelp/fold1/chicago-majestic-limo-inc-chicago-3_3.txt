I did not want the service provided by Chicago Majestic on one of the coldest nights of the year to go unnoticed. Â I am sure I am not alone in finding limo service at O'Hare to be a sometimes perilous experience. In fact we first discovered Majestic after a complete CF with another firm that I will not mention in this review. Suffice it to say that, after being stood up for more than an hour, waiting in the cold for a limo that never came, and being unable to contact the dispatcher, I called Majestic in desperation and we were promptly rescued. After that experience we have used them maybe three or four times with total satisfaction every time. However, this recent experience was above and beyond. The weather was frightful and it can often be a miserable experience waiting for a ride at O'Hare. However, the dispatcher reached out to us immediately the plane landed and then coordinated the pickup so that we didn't wait a single second in the cold. Once we called from the baggage claim, we waited no more than five minutes for the car to appear and we walked out to greet it without any wait. In addition the ride was luxurious and the driver most courteous. Total quality all round. On top of that it is an all-included electronic billing: no fumbling for tip money or worrying about how much; and no fiddling trying to sign those stupid 19th century credit card slips. Oh and you can do all bookings online - no need to make phone calls etc. No doubt Chicago Majestic is number one in our books for travel to and from O'Hare.
