The Bikes, Blues and BBQ tour of Hyde Park was one of the highlights of our summer in Chicago.  Our tour guide, Vincent, was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and just plain fun to be with for this three-hour tour.  Highlights include the grounds of the 1893 Worlds Fair, the campus of the University of Chicago (Rockefeller Chapel and the site of development of the first atomic bomb), and several Frank Lloyd Wright houses.  Biking is relaxed with numerous stops.  Don't miss this, especially if you can line up Vincent as your guide!
