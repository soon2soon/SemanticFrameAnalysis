If there is a Groupon, this is a no-brainer. By far one of my favorite things I got to do in Chicago. This is also a great idea to take right when you get in, so it will give you a pretty good idea of what to do around Museum Campus. The Segway are super fun. The guides take time to really instruct you so you feel safe and by no time you are zipping along. Some tips: 1. Try to stay close to the guide. You hear more interesting tibits 2. Start your Chicago trip with this tour so you have an idea of how to get around Museum Campus 3. Bring a camera. Most of our best pictures came on this tour (You will have a shot to take the million dollar picture with the skyline behind you and the lake) 4. Prepare for cold weather. The area off the lake tends to be chillier than inside the city. 5. Do not fear the Segway. You are its master. Make it respect you. Or else you will look awkward and might even be served some concrete. Great great experience!
