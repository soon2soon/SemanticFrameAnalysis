This is my first time in the city and with 2200 pizzerias in Chicago there was no way for me to know which one to go to. My friend found out about the pizza and cocktail tour and we saw it was a good deal. I definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in finding out more about the pizza culture here, or anyone who just loves pizza, good drinks, and nice, exciting people!! Also, I was surprised to see that there were many Chicago natives on this tour as well!! Oh yeah, the pizza is delicious and the tour guide, Kevin, was nice!! If you are going to the night tour save your appetite. It's a lot of food!!
