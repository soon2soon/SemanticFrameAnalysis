My girlfriend and I went to the Skokie Lagoons location and rented a canoe for the day. We went on a tuesday so we didn't have to make a reservation. The shed was easy to locate and the staff was friendly and very helpful. My girlfriend had never went canoeing before so this was the perfect place to take her. The Lagoons are very calm and secluded. We even took a picnic basket and found a perfect spot! The day turned out to be a very good experience. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to just get away from the city and enjoy a peaceful day with mother nature and a special someone.
