My husband and two friends went on the brew bus last night and had a blast. The trip exceeding our expectations. We visited 3 different locations and each place was awesome. Kevin and Roman were great hosts and by the end of the night everyone was friends. If you want to have a great night, meet new friends and check out local breweries then this is the tour for you. My husband and I are already planning on taking my mom and her husband when they visit us this winter.
