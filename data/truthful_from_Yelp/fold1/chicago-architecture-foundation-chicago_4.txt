Spectacular buildings, great setting, small and select collection relatively speaking, good food available. One can easily spend a whole day here, enjoying, at a relaxed pace, the grounds, gardens, buildings, exhibits, and perhaps dining in the restaurant. Two tips: 1) there are several guided tours that are free. Take at least one. The architectural tour shows and explains things about the buildings you'd not likely see, or understand, on your own. 2) at the information desk in the lobby, get tickets for Chicago Architecture Foundation, which you might save for another day
