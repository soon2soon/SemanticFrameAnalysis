Took this tour on my first trip to Chicago and it was great! We got to try a mix of deep dish and thin crust pizzas (there's only so much deep dish you can eat in a 3-4 hour span). I thought that I knew a lot about pizza until we met our guide, Jon. Well worth it if you're in Chicago and love pizza.
