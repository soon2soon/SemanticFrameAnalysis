Very satisfied by my experience!!!   Hey If you want to have an awesome time with a bunch of people amidst the buildings downtown, with a nautical twist.... THIS IS IT.  I took my parents and other family members out on a two-hour cruise... a three-hour tour seemed ominous.  I recommend at least going for two hours, one hour wouldn't let you cover the ground that you'll want to.  I was able to bring drinks and food for everyone, although I had to stay sober because I was driving.  This is a great way to entertain people, and if you do it right (bring good food and drinks), you can have a classy experiance for a moderate price.  The staff is very helpful too.  Reservations were easy.  I spoke with a gentleman named Tony who was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Keep in mind that this is a boating experiance though, I haven't read all the reviews but I bet there is someone complaining about being bounced by wakes from other boats (which didn't happen too often, there weren't big and they actually added a little excitement).
