This was great!  My dad was in town visiting for my birthday and I was looking for something fun for us to do together.  We went to 3 spots Goose Island, Haymarket and Moonshine.  I found a new spot that I'd love to go back to Haymarket in West Loop.  The beer was delicious, the breweries super fun & Kevins information was educational and fun to listen to!
