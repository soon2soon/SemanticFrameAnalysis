Compared to other aloft properties, this hotel gets an A. It's location is excellent, with several great bars and restaurants nearby. It also has an excellent restaurant within the hotel, Beatrix. I liked them so much for dinner that I tried them again for breakfast. The gym is much larger than other properties too. I'll certainly plan on staying there again on my next trip to Chicago.
