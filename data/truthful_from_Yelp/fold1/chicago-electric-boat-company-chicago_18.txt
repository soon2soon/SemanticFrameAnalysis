While waiting to board we hung out by the water and waved at boats going by, took some pictures. The check-in process was seamless. The General Manager, Eric Hickerson, seemed like a good guy. I had a travelzoo deal for $99 for 2 hrs. We boarded the boat exactly at the time we were scheduled. Would recommend using the restroom prior to your scheduled time. There are not a lot of instructions, and that is because it's not too difficult to navigate a boat at 5-7 miles per hour. Just get out of the way for the big ones to get by, don't hit the cement walls, etc. We left at 3pm, made it to Marina Center on the South Branch by 3:30 or so, then made it to the branch of Goose Island in the North Branch by 4:15pm or so, then headed to the lake. While heading to the lake (you cannot enter the lake), we slowed down to take pictures enjoy the view, and made it back to the dock just before 5pm (so perfect timing). I recommend bringing snacks and a cooler with drinks (it is BYOB, so we were drinking beer). They give you a walkie talky in case you have trouble, and so you can notify crew when you are coming back into the dock. Navigating the dock is the hardest part...my recommendation (which I think the staff should pass on at the beginning) is to approach while heading eastward. Make sure you are directly facing the dock entrance. Place the boat on low speed, and only proceed when there are NO other big boats heading east or west, because the large wake of a bigger boat WILL change the trajectory of these small electric boats. Overall, what a great, relatively inexpensive way to enjoy the river in your own privacy (while drinking beers). Manage your expectations and you will do fine. BTW, the hard plastic windows can be zipped to make this boat practically weather-proof (we took it out at 40 degree whether and needed fleeces only, no winter hats).
