My son and I took the Chicago History Lovers Pedway Tour on a Sunday afternoon.  Our guide, Dan, provided us wih notebooks that we could carry on the tour that contained all kinds of information and visual aids to help us follow along.  Dan was a plethera of information!  I don't know how he remembers all of that detail.  But, I can guarantee you this:  You will most certainly learn something new during this tour.  Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking for almost four hours with occassion breaks to sit down. A good thing to know:  the Pedway tour doesn't make all of the usual stops on the weekends because some of the buildings are closed.  That being said... I would definitely take this tour again and probably on a weekday.
