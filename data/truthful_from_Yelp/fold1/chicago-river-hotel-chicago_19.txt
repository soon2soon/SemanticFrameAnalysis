Great views, close to the metro lines. 30 minutes from the airport by train. Close to many restaurants such as the Purple Pig and many others. Close to everything. Free wifi, free espresso, free cappuccino, free latte... It's b/w Michigan and State so its in the heart of Chicago. The bed was very comfortable. The room was small but who needs a giant room when on vacation. THe room did feel cool most of the time. We were not able to turn the heater up high for some reason and the toilet kept running. Other than that the sleep was great. Everyone decided to leave at the same time so the elevators got full and busy.
