Spent 2 nights here recently. It was a great value on a neat hipster hotel in a fun part of town (I even made my reservations through the yelp site - worked perfect). The room was smallish, but utilitarian hipster, clean, and well kept.   The bed was very comfortable as were the sheets and pillows. Front desk was friendly and efficient - having that cab waiting for me for my 5:15AM trip to O'Hare was appreciated. The bakery adjoining the hotel was solid. The attached Berkshire Room was excellent for small food bites (the short rib on creamy blue cheese polenta was very tasty).  The list of bourbons drew me in and proved enjoyable.  Sitting at the bar, I enjoyed the opportunity to observe an outstanding bartender - his precision, skill, and attention to detail in making various cocktails was most impressive. A great stay and would definitely stay here again.
