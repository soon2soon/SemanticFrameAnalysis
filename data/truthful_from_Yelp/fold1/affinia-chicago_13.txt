I recently stayed two nights at The Affinia and absolutely loved it. The staff was cheerful and accommodating, the room snazzy and uber comfortable. They've got fun little touches like a pillow menu and kits to help you get out and tour the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel and plan on staying there again.
