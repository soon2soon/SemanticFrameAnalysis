This was a stroke of genius I had, it was going to be our last day in Chicago and we had a flight at 5pm, so what I thought would be kind of a wasted day.  But then I found CPT online and decided to do a 4 hr tour with my wife and then they dropped us off at the airport - fun and convenient!! The guide and driver were incredibly knowledgeable and we really had a great time.  I think next time we should have done it in the BEGINNING because it gives you a great feel for the city and where everything is! Could not recommend this higher!
