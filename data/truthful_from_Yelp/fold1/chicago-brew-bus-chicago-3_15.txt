I booked a tour on the Brew Bus this past Saturday for my boyfriend and myself and we had a wonderful time!  First off, Kevin and Chris are FANTASTIC and so accommodating!  My boyfriend was driving in from St. Louis the Friday before (when Chicago was receiving 3-6inches of snow) and I wasn't sure when/if he was going to make it in or if we'd be able to make our 11:30am tour on Saturday.  I called Kevin, he called and emailed me back, assuring me that I could reschedule the tour or get a full refund, no problem, if he didn't make it up.   Luckily we made the tour and met up with the group on Saturday at Goose Island.  As a group, we all picked the first four beers we would be tasting.  Such an amazing selection!  My boyfriend is quite a beer connoisseur, and one of the tastings even moved into his top 10!  From there, we boarded the brew bus to be greeted by Jonathon, the driver, free shots of honey rum, and some pretzels to soak up those first few tastings. Then on to Haymarket Brewery! There, we received 4 more samples and a tour of their brewing facilities which was incredibly interesting.  Many of us also ordered some food/appetizers at Haymarket which was all wonderful.  The last stop of the day was at Moonshine Brewing Company.  With 6 more samples, we were beginning to feel pretty good, but still able to appreciate the quality, flavors and distinct experiences each brewery and beer had to offer. All in all, this was well worth the money, a great tour and I highly recommend this to anyone looking to experiences some local Chicago breweries with the added benefit of the great tour guide and craft beer knowledge that Kevin and Chris provide!
