This hotel is great! Everyone at the front desk was so helpful and knowledgeable (heck, they even knew where I should go to pick up the 60 bus towards Cicero). The machines where you can fill up a plastic bottle of water and then re-use it make so much sense; I can't believe other places haven't caught on to this. The Wi-Fi was free, which was a pleasant surprise (usually I've found that the cost of a hotel's Wi-Fi is inversely proportional to the hotel's rates). The size of the room is what you'd expect for something smack dab in the middle of the Loop (i.e., it's going to be on the small side). The location is super convenient too. It's not as "cool" as staying at the Drake Hotel and your view will probably just be other buildings and a 7-Eleven, but it's still a great value and an awesome place.
