Pete from Bike and Roll Chicago was awesome  I took my granddaughter who is 14 to an sunrise tour at 7am on a Sunday and Pete was so patient with her while she learned to stop LOL The tour was very educational for me :) learned so much about the city that I live in unreal.  Will go again and have recommended to many!  Thank you Maria C from NL
