My friend owned a property that he rented through At Home Inn for about a year. They worked with him to coordinate short-term rentals with third parties. Most often it was for people in Chicago for a few weeks on business.  Renters were able to get a beautiful furnished apartment in Greektown with THE MOST incredible view of downtown. All for a far more reasonable price than an extended-stay hotel, within walking distance of the Loop! Since then, I have gotten to know a lot more about the business and the couple who run it (the Biddles) who totally rock.  They are extremely conscientious and truly love what they do.  I have recommended their service to a lot of friends, family, and even coworkers in town from other offices.  They have condos and apartments all over the city, that can pretty much satisfy anyone's needs. If you're looking for a place to stay in Chicago for two days, or even for 20 weeks, Bob and Liz can definitely accommodate you.  Check out the website.
