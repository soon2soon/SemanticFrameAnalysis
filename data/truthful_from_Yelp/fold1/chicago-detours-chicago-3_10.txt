My boyfriend and I just experienced the "historic pub tour". Our tour guide was Elizabeth and she could not have been better. She was excited, enthusiastic, and knew what she was talking about. The tour was very interactive and social. The food was good for small bites. It's definitely not dinner but a good jump start to a night out/dinner. I would recommend this to anyone going to Chicago who enjoys a little mix of history and drinks, who wants to learn a little about the city they live in/visiting.
