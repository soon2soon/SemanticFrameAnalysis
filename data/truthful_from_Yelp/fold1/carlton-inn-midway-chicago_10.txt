Such a great find and triple A discount! this place is super clean and the staff is very friendly! we got stuck at midway, missed our flight and we found the Carton Inn using Hotels.com. Â I didn't have any of my shower things so they brought us a bag of shower stuff and a crib for our twins. Such a great experience! Ordered Giordano's pizza delivery and the shuttle guy was super nice too!
