I booked this tour at home in San Diego when I should have been on my lunch break. Hence the food tour. I knew that Chicago was known for their pizzas and I wanted a taste of the best! This gives you exactly that. (Actually a little bit more than a taste) Great variety- not all deep dish! Jon, our tour guide, was great. He not only gave history about pizza in Chicago, but he gave us little tidbits of facts as we toured the city. You get a little tour of Chicago and then pit stops to eat! If we came back, I'd do this again. As long as the stops change (which they do) but Coalfire can always stay! You guys should add more tours! Like a neighborhood tour and the stop could be the best known food for that area. The sky's the limit!
