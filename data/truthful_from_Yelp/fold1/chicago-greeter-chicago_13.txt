This was one of the best experiences I've had with a "tour" in the many cities I've visited. I have to say I was a bit nervous about meeting someone randomly for the first time and have them take us around the city but Larry was an amazing guide. The way he catered our tour to our wishes was amazing. He offered us a very different view of a great city and gave us an insider's knowledge of things you would have probably just walked past. I've recommended this and Larry to everyone I know who is going to Chicago.
