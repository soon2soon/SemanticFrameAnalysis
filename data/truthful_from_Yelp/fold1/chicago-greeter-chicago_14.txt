This is such a fantastic program because you get to take a tour of the beautiful city of Chicago for FREE! It's a program where people from Chicago kindly volunteer their time to show you around their city. How cool is that? You basically go to their website and fill out the registration form. It asks what parts of Chicago you'd like to visit and vuola! Then someone contacts you within a week of your tour. Our volunteer took us to Millennium Park, the gold coast, and finally finishing at the Lincoln Park zoo. The volunteer services also gave us an all day CTA (bus or subway) pass for FREE. Along the way our volunteer Ellen provided us with a brief history of the city, buildings, parks, etc. It was a lot of walking but well worth the site seeing and it's architectural history. Overall, I would definitely recommend this FREE service tour.
