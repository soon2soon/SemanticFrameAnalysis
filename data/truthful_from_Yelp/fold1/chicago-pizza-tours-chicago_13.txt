A truly great experience. I've lived in Chicago for over 8 years and I've now gone on this tour twice. The first time, I went reluctantly when my suburb friends booked the trip. Ended up having a blast and learning things about Chicago I never knew. The second time I took my niece and we had a great time touring around the city and sampling some of Chicago's best pizza. One of the best parts of this tour is that Jon and "Soap" (the driver) take you out of downtown and into the neighborhoods where real Chicagoans eat. Â This tour is a really fun thing to do in Chicago and I would highly recommend going.
