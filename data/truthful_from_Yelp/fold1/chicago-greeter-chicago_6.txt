Such a great experience! Paul, our tour guide, was the best! I just moved to the city and wanted to get acquainted with everything. Paul talked to us about our interests and decided what we "had to see" and led the way. He was so friendly and knowledgeable - he even knew the "best hot-dog joint in town," so we could stop and have lunch as well as showed us some of the less-traveled spots so I knew a place or 2 I could visit once I got all settled in. It was fast-paced and so personalized. The confirmation email said the tour would be anywhere from 2-4 hours...we ended up walking around the city for well over that, Paul said as long as we weren't tired or had to go, he was around to give us a great tour of Chicago. I would always recommend this :)
