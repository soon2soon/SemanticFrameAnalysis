This was a Blast!!  2 1/2 hour tour of the city - 1) Buckingham Fountain, 2) Grant Park 3) Field, Shedd, and Adler Museums, on to 4) Northerly Island, and then around the top of 5) Soldier's Field. Absolutely fantastic and I live in Chicago.   You start with a video in their basement office of all the things that can go wrong. Sign the disclaimer.  Then you get your helmet and practice for about 20 minutes depending on the group size.  Next you are on your tour for 2+ hours.  We had two nieces in from out of town and they said it was their favorite thing we did while they were here. Dustin was our leader and he was very knowledgeable. He fed us tidbits like Elizabeth Taylor living in the penthouse of the Hilton Hotel during her marriage to Nicky Hilton. Who knew?!
