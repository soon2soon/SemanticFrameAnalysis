This Segway company and our tour guide, Dustin, was the BEST! We came to Chicago for a few days from California and had great service start to finish. My husband decided not to go at the last minute, and he was immediately issued a refund. My girls and I went, (ages 22 and 20) and we HAD THE BEST TIME!! I haven't had that much fun in years! Once you get the hang of it, (and it takes some practice, but Dustin is more than patient and knowledgable) it is sooooo fun. We took the Saturday night tour which ends near the Planetarium so you can see the fireworks at Navy Pier...totally recommend. And there are less pedestrians at night as well....no extra points for hitting people! Dustin was very charming, witty, handsome and he tells corny jokes, which was awesome!!
