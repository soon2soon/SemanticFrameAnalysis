Tasty and affordable restaurant, friendly and helpful concierge, centrally located, taxi light Â service, and clean modern rooms...why would I stay anywhere else. This place really surprised me but it's my second time staying now and I had a quality experience each time. Loved the front desk and location especially. They upgraded me to a suite for "inconveniencing" me the first night with a double bed room (was not even close to an inconvenience)...and they also gave me breakfast vouchers just because. Love this place.
