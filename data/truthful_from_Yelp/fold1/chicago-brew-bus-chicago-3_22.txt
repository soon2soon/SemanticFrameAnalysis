I bought tickets for myself, my husband, my brother-in-law, and his girlfriend for my husband's 31st birthday. Kevin was SO INCREDIBLY HELPFUL in helping me plan which day/time to get our tickets. He really went above and beyond for us, and was extremely prompt in replying to my emails/phone calls/text messages (I was getting married that weekend as well, so was kind of in Bridezilla mode). We met at Goose Island Brewery, where we sampled a few different types of beer, then got on the bus where we had more beer and snacks before arriving at Haymarket Brewery. Staff showed us through the brewery, and we sampled more beer - also, the food here was delicious (try the sweet potato tots - you'll be glad you did)! We boarded the Brew Bus again, where we indulged even more on our way to our final destination. I don't even remember the name of that last place, because I was pretty drunk. There were probably 14 of us, and by the end of the tour it was like we all knew each other! It was a great time, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys drinking beer. I am not even a beer drinker, and I had a great time!
