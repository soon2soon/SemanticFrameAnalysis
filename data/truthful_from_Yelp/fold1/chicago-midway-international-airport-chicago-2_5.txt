I almost always fly out of Midway. Why? Because of three reason: 1) Southwest. The best airline to where I want to go. 2) Convenience. It is easier to get to, easier to unload, easier to park if necessary, easier period! 3) Friendliness is rampant at Midway and mostly missing at O'Hare. Safe, easy, friendly, and southwest makes Midway the place for me!!
