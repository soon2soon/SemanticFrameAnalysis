Greatest Idea Ever!!! My girlfriends and I did a run through Grant Park with Marlin for part of my bachelorette party. Many of my friends are non-runners but we all had an absolute blast. Marlin is fantastic - took so many pictures (posted the same day!) and was incredibly knowledgeable about the city and the park - I loved every minute of it. I would refer this tour to anyone who is looking for a cool way to learn about Chicago - I'll be doing this again!
