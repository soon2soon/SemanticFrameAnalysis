Last minute trip to Chicago for a funeral and it was that thoughtful and caring service that I appreciated from Alamo.   Small, last minute upgrade to a Toyota Camry ( like I drive at home), made me feel confident with driving in a different city.   Thanks Alamo !   And the rates were definitely reasonable.  Sheila L. .
