This was an excellent experience! Our guide Scott, was very knowledgable about the city and a great guide. We were all first time Segway users and Scott quickly had us all comfortable maneuvering around in no time. The highlight of the tour was definitely soldier field and learning about all the buildings in Chicago. Great tour!
