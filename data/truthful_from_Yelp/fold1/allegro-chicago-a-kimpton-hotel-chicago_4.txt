Thank you Kimpton and Allegro Chicago staff for helping make my son's out-of-town stay and birthday one to remember!  We gave him a Kimpton e-card and he stayed for 2 nights with his gal at your great establishment.  They loved the room, loved the free happy hour (the hot toddy's were so good), loved the coffee in the morning, loved the valet service and loved the fact that he was treated to champagne and cake along with a birthday card.  The best part was the location and your wonderful service. PS - I've stayed with your before and it was all good!
