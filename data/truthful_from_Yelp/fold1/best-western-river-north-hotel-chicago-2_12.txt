My first choice when staying in Chicago.  It's not the fanciest place but it's a nice clean place to stay and is centrally located. Also there is FREE parking for guests. The staff is great - they were very accommodating when I needed a spot to plug in my Volt.  They just have 110 outlets but those are all I need since when I'm in Chicago I usually just leave the car in the lot and do stuff around town.  It may seem expensive at first but when you factor in parking and the location it's quite good compared to other downtown locations.
