We took the Interior Architectural Tour with Vickie on a recent trip to Chicago.  The tour was very good. It started off at the Chase Building, as it started - we were totally sure how it was going to go, easily blamed on a not very animated group.  It took off quickly and was very fun, interesting and informational.  The tour was a bit less about architecture and had a bit more about history and some fun facts than we had expected. Vickie was a great tour guide, had an appropriate amount of niceness and a bit of sarcasm about the great City of Chicago.   Chicago Detours offers 12 tours total (apparently?), we are absolutely going to look into taking another one the next time we are in Chicago.  I/we would absolutely recommend taking a tour offered by Chicago Detours.
