My boyfriend and I booked a room at this hotel using a Priceline deal. I read some reviews and feared for the worst but I was actually pretty impressed by this hotel. We were on the 8th floor and had an updated room with no view. But that's fine. We spent very little time in the room anyway. The hotel was centrally located and it was very easy to get around the city on the bus and on the train. We were a short walk from Michigan Avenue, too. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and offered free filtered water and wifi. Our room also had a fridge and a microwave. Not sure what more you could ask for? I'd definitely stay there again if I had the chance.
