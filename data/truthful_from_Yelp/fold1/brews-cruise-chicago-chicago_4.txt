We did the city tour and it was an awesome way to spend a Friday afternoon. Admittedly, I signed up to see the Goose Island production facility which was extremely cool to see since it's not open to the public very often. Though, we also got to see other sized breweries like Revolution and Lake Effect Brewing. It was neat to see the same practices and processes applied to different sized operations. The guide and owner, Rick, is very knowledgeable about beer and the brewing process. He also provides insight to the Chicago brewing scene and the explosion of breweries that has happened in the past few years. Rick provides water and snacks on the bus to help keep you hydrated and nourished! I would suggest this tour to both the beer enthusiast and those that are looking to learn more about the local beer scene. This could provide for a good birthday or bachelor/bachelorette party outing as well.
