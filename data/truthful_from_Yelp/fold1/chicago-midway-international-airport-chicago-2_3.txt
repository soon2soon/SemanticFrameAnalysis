I am going to start by saying I am biased because I was born and raised in this great (if not greatest city in the world) city of Chicago. The airport is accessible by the Orange "L" from the loop. There is plenty of parking and this airport hosts primarily southwest airlines. The airport is clean and I haven't encountered any rude workers at all thus far. Â It gets really busy here with crazy lines during the holidays which is the case anywhere. It is smaller than O'hare but definitely less intimidating and less of a chance to get lost here with its minimal terminals. There is long term parking as well as rental car stations with shuttles to and from both. There are multiple hotels nearby if you drive further south on Cicero avenue. There is also a Starbucks and Giordanos further south of the airport. All in all you can't go wrong flying out of here.
