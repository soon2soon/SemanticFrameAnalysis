My husband and I just completed our second tour with Caravan.  This time in Panama. The hotels were first class, the activities great and the food in the Buffets good. It would have been nice to have had ala carte once. Gererado our guide was knowledgeable, friendly and made certain we had a great time!  Alexander our bus driver was a man of few words even in Spanish. I'm bilingual. He took very good care of us and drove very safely in a country where road signs, stop signs and lights are just a suggestion! I definitely would recommend this tour just bring your bug repellent and sun screen.
