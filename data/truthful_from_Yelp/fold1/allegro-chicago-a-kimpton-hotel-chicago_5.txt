I booked this accommodation last second for my fianc√©e and I. I have been in Illinois for three weeks, training for a job and he came out for one weekend to visit me! Naturally we wanted to visit the city and stay in a prime location. Hotel Allegro was the least expensive by a landslide in the Chicago loop area. We arrived and it was easy find, which was amazing! The lobby clerk, Gertrude was incredible! She was very helpful and friendly and gave us restaurant and activity suggestions. Our room was on the 19th floor (top floor!) Since I requested a view. Our room was cozy with a killer view and a comfortable bed. The location was perfect, a short was to bars, restaurants, millenium park, the bean and much more. A longer, but pleasant walk to Navy Pier and downtown. This place was great!
