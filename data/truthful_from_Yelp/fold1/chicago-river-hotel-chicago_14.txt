What a surprise! Great place at a great price with great customer service...a rarity these days. My husband and I enjoyed three days in the city, and with the hotel in this location we walked everywhere! It was very hot while we were there, so we appreciated the cold beer in the bar next door and the FREE cold water bottles. Would definitely stay there again, and we highly recommend it.
