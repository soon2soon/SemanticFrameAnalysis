I can't say enough good things about this hotel!  I booked this hotel for $99/night way back in April for my August Lollapalooza trip.  I had a tiny room with a double bed, but for the price/location, I really couldn't complain -- I just needed a place to sleep. Check-in was self-serve at an airline style kiosk, which was pretty rad especially when it spit out my coded keys.  When I got to my floor, I discovered they had filtered water and empty bottles.  Even better, the caps sealed, so Lollapalooza let me bring in my "factory sealed waters."  Score! Staff was hands-off, but I loved that.  I needed nothing during my stay.  As I said, the room was small, but not Europe-small, so I could actually walk around all 3 sides of my bed, lol.  Free wi-fi wouldn't work in my room for some reason, but wired did.  I'll definitely be staying here if I end up at Lollapalooza again.
