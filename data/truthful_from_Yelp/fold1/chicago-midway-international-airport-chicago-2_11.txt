I love love love Midway airport! I grew up near here, so I prefer it since it's close and an easy in-and-out. But even if you don't live near Midway, you should still fly here when traveling in Chicago. Why? Because it's a fucking dream come true compared to O'Hare. SERIOUSLY. And Southwest is the main operating airline here. Love them. Go! And you can get a decent Chicago style hot dog while you're waiting to board.
