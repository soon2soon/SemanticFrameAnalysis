Minutes from Chicago's Midway airport, this motel is conveniently located to downtown Chicago either by car or the El train. The hotel is located in a large hispanic neigborhood. We were uncomfortable at first, but realized it was safe at all times. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, the staff the friendliest and most helpful I have ever encountered in the US or Europe. The free shuttle wil take you to the airport or to the nearest El train. The modest breakfast was excellent (they served Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwiches - egg, sausage and cheese between a bagel) as well as donuts.
