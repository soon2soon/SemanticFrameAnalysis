I am a regular.  This is my "go to" car service.  They offer exceptional service and in probably over 100 trips over the past few years there has never - not once - been any problem.  I often end up changing my travel plans on short notice and the folks at Chicago Majestic have always been able to accommodate me and do so very graciously.  And yes, Joe is great, but I wouldn't hesitate to use any of their drivers.  This is a really, really well run company that understands customer service.
