Hands down this was the best part of my trip to Chicago. My boyfriend and I were on the Tuesday 10 a.m. cruise. Even though a huge tour group beat us to the front of the line, there was plenty of seating and I had a great view the whole time. Our docent was extremely knowledgeable and did a great job presenting the information - I think getting a good docent is key, which is unfortunately left up to chance! Such a great way to see the city! I highly recommend it.
