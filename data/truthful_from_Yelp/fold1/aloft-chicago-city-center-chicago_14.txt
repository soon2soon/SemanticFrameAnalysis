Great location and great hotel. Proximity to all the fun bars, restaurants, parks and Divy bikes in River North makes this hotel a 5-star for location. The staff is extremely and helpful throughout your stay whether it's at the bar, housekeeping, valet or checking in. The bar and restaurant downstairs are a great place to start off the evening or meet up with other friends. Will definitely be staying here again for our next visit to Chicago.
