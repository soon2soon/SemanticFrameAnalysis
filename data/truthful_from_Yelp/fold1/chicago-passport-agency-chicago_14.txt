After responding 'yes' to a invitation for a friends wedding happening at the end of the month in Toronto, I realized my passport was expired and I had to go to the passport agency for expedited service.  I made an appointment over the phone, filled out the proper forms and showed up early in case there was a line.  The office doesn't open until 8:45 Am but there were already people waiting in line at 8:30.  Once the line started moving, it was efficient and the security team was clear with their instructions.  Everyone was surprisingly calm and patient, which seems to be the key to the line moving quickly.  I wish it was like this at the madhouse we call O'hare.  Once I got up to the 18th floor, I was asked for my confirmation number.  Don't forget it because the guard turned away at least two people while I waiting to see someone.  When it was my turn, I handed over all my information to the extremely friendly govt employee, a few questions about my trip and $170 ($110 renewal fee and $60 expedited fee) I was done.  I was expecting to be there hours but it took a total of 45 minutes from security downstairs to confirmation.  The estimated time for my passport to arrive in the mail was 10 days but it arrived in 4.  Everything went so smoothly I still can't believe this is a government office.
