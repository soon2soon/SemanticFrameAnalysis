As an SPG member who have stayed at several starwood hotels, I must say Aloft Chicago City Center was one of the best I've ever experienced! I love the fact that the hotel was located in the middle of everything in Chicago. Lobby area was very hip. There're work stations with wifi connections, a pool table and a cool louging area. Staffs were friendly and helpful. They helped us chack in half a day early. Just ask them if you need anything. Our room on the 9th floor was very clean, sleek and trendy with great accomodations. Coffee maker was my favorite! We enjoyed our stay very much and I believe you will too!
