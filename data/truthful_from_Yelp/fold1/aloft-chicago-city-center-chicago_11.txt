What a fantastic hotel!!!!! We had a perfect stay at Aloft Chicago. The reception is very friendly and welcoming. We were able to check in at 11 am without any issues (which was an added perk) and were offered a late check out at 4pm. Rooms are modern and clean & the public areas are modern, clean and trendy. They even have a fridge stocked with ice cream and snacks downstairs in case you get a midnight craving (isn't that genious?!) Wifi in the rooms is free. The mattress was pure HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I believe it was a Beautyrest mattress and it was super comfortable. The Beatrix restaurant downstairs is killer & a great spot to grab breakfast & brunch or any of your meals for that matter. The location CANNOT BE BEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're so close to everything!!!! The blue line is 5 min away with a convenient connection to the airport. I would without a doubt recommend this hotel 100000%!!!!!!!! I'm a gold Starwoods member & I've stayed at many properties around the world and I have to say that this is one of my top 5 picks!!!! Can't wait to be back!
