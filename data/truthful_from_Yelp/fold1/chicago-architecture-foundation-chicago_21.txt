Take the CAF Boat Tour!  Personally, I consider myself to have very little interest in architecture, but the tour was fantastic and kept me entertained the full 90 minutes.  You will see all the sights of Chicago, and learn a lot too.  Definitely sit on the left side of the boat - I felt bad for people on the right side, because they had to keep craning their necks to get the best view.   Also, if you are visiting in the summer, take a morning tour before it gets hot - you will need sunscreen!
