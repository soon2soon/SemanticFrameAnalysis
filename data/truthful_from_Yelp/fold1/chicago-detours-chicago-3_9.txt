I took the Inside the Loop Interior Architectural Walking Tour with Elizabeth on a Friday afternoon. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but it turned out great as the tour lead us through a handful of historic buildings which are more off the beaten path. Highlights include the Macy's building (originally Marshall Fields), Chicago Cultural Centre, the sky church at the Chicago Temple Building, Block 37, stories on the public transportation system and much more. A sample of a local frozen kefir cafe (like frozen yogurt) was also set up which was a nice touch. I was surprised to hear that most people on this tour are from the Chicago area. It says a lot about the quality of Chicago Detours that locals are even signing up to take this tour of their own city. If available, I would recommend using a two for one on any of the deal sites. $26 is steep for a walking tour but for two people, it's for sure worth it.
