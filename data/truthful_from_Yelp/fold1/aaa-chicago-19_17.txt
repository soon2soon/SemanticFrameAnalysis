Yesterday, I signed up with AAA.  I was having an issue with my car's battery and my plan was to have it jumped.  Afterward, I was going to go to the car dealer for a replacement.  The nice part is that the latter step was not needed as, the AAA service agent was able to replace the battery and perform a diagnostic check (on the new battery and the alternator) to make sure they both were properly functioning, all within 30 minutes of my initial call. Time and money were saved...it does not get any better than that.
