Breezy checkin no matter how busy! The TSA is very nice here, they actually talk to you vs. At you. I enjoy getting rentals here and ALWAYS checkin and drop bags prior to dropping the rental car off. It's just easier for airpor travel. Clean restrooms Plenty of seating Lots of food options Right in the city so easy connections.
