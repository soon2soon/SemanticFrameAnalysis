My grandma and I always belonged to AAA, we just loved the trip tiks for our long drives across the country or in Canada. So of course, when it came time to plan a honeymoon I knew where to go.  Illi helped me plan a wonderful get away to Japan for us at a wonderful price.  She made sure to have us upgraded to better hotels than what the package offered encase of earthquakes. It was worth it! She was friendly, professional, and knew what she was doing.  I can't wait to plan another vacation.
