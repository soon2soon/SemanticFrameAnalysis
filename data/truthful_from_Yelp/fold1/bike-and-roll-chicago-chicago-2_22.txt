I used a Groupon to take a Segway tour and my friend and I had a blast!!!! they canceled our first trip due to heavy rain and very very accommodating to reschedule for another day.   WE went on October 29th and although it was overcast and cool. it was one of the most fun experiences my friend and i have had in Chicago.   Our tour Guide PETER was phenomenal.  First..he put up with all of our laughing and inside jokes through the whole tour.  We were the only 2 signed up that day so Peter gave us a private tour!!!  he was so knowledgeable!!  We were so surprised that as 2 Chicagoans who visit the city often...there was so much we did not know about the city and so many places we had not seen!!!  The Segways were so much fun, so easy to handle and it was such a great vantage point  at which to see the city from.   We would go back over and over again and request Peter each time!!!   Thanks Peter from Marie and Cheryl!!!
