Hotwire lead us to the Kinzie Hotel. In town on business and stayed at The Marriott on Michigan Ave. Decided to stay the weekend and do the tourist thing. We couldn't afford to add extra nights at The Marriott and ended up staying here thanks to Hotwire. I still found the hotel pricey but there isn't much of a choice when it comes to that in Chicago. Putting the price aside .. wow! Our stay here was amazing. The location is perfect for bars and restaurants. Actually, the location is perfect for probably anything you're looking to do downtown. The room was sleek and modern. The wallpaper with the map on was a particularly nice touch. The staff were friendly. I really don't have anything negative to say! Like i said, the price could be better, but isn't that always the case? On a side note, The Marriott left A LOT to be desired and the Kinzie made it look like a 1 star hotel in comparison.
