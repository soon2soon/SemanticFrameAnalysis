We went last week and we cannot stop talking about this tour! Worth every penny. We live in Chicago and typically shy away from the touristy stuff. This was a history lesson. Super friendly, engaging, educated tour leader! The gentleman who marked this tour low obviously didn't read the info. We were very aware that drinks were not included in the cost of the tour so we knew what we were getting for our money and we knew that we would be dropped at a location that was different than the start. Too bad he gave them 2 stars. Seems like everyone else enjoyed themselves and knew what they were getting. I have talked up this tour almost daily since we were on it. Great job!
