Just finished the wicker park/bucktown food tour, Kent was our guide. I have absolutely no complaints about any part of the tour. Every single place we went to was delicious! The walk itself was very relaxing and to top it off Kent has a great and humorous personality,  which made the tour that much more enjoyable. It's nice to see a different part of the city, other than the skyscrapers. There's so much more to do, see and experience in this area.  This tour is a definite must, one recommendation to food planet though. When we stop at Piece Pizza, reverse the pitcher of water and a shot glass of beer and this will be the golden ticket!!
