Just want to say  THANK YOU to AAA  for really came thru for me today ( as usual) Besides the extremely long (on hold) time to speak to a representative due to the extreme cold, the service was wonderful!!! Johnathan from truck #42 called me twice and went above and beyond in helping me out. On one of the coldest nights this winter  he was upbeat, patient and professional and still had 6 hrs left on his 48 hr shift.....Thank You for keeping this girl battery charged and on the road!!!
