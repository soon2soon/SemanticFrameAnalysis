Unbelievably wonderful stay! The room was sparkling clean. The towels were soft and we had plenty of them. The lobby was amazing with the bar downstairs. The food in the bar was terrific! We ate at the restaurant upstairs and enjoyed a lovely breakfast with clients while having a meeting. The front desk staff was super friendly, genuine, and kind. Very helpful! The doorman/valet were sweet, always taking care of us Ladies who stayed for 4 days. We had no man with us, but these gentlemen were always terrific to us, making sure we had a cab and instructing the cabbie where we were going. One valet even told the cabbie to "take good care of these Ladies!" and he did. Very nice! I had a problem with a bellman when I was leaving. I contacted Julian, (I think that's his name) the Bell Staff Manager. He was wonderful with regards to my complaint and jumped right on it. I am not holding the hotel responsible for one rude employee. He was NOT up to par with the rest of the hotel, the staff or our stay. And Magnificent Mile is just that! Wow! You have to try it, just once. And when you do, stay at the Marriott, if you want a Magnificent Stay in Chicago!
