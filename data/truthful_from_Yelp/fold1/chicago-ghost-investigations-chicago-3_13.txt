This was an incredible experience. I am so happy that there was no special effects or added "ghosts" like those terrible television shows. This is really an intimate experience that helps you to connect with various spirits. I did not believe this was possible until I went on this tour. People who completely did not believe in ghosts in my group ended up changing their minds by the end. Definitely check them out!
