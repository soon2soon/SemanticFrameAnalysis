LOVED this hotel!  When my boyfriend and I were coming to Chicago for valentines weekend we did a quick google search for "hip trendy hotels" and ACME hotel was the first one to pop up.  After checking out the website, we didn't have to look any further and we immediately booked a room (for a reasonable price i might add- $100/night).   Check in was a breeze and the room was awesome. We had a standard room so it wasn't huge- but it had a cool feel to it. Very "loft-y".  A comfortable king sized bed, 2 robes for our leisure and a really cool bathroom.  I also enjoyed the table with booth and ottomans to sit at. You usually don't get something like that in a hotel room.   There isn't a closet so be prepared for that. But there's some hooks on the wall that you can hang some things on and that worked great for us.   The location of this hotel is great too- so many great restaurants and bars within walking distance (check out Sable for brunch).  Howl at the Moon is close by.  Also there's a grocery store on the corner so you can pick up some in room booze and snacks if needed. It's a great central location that is not more than 15 minutes from any part of downtown Chicago. Also just a block and a half away from Michigan Avenue shopping.   The deli downstairs has delicious food! Definitely worth checking out.  The Berkshire room bar downstairs is cool but a little pricey.   I would definitely stay here again next visit to Chicago!
