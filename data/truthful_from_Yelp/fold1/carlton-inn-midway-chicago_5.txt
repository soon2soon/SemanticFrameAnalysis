The Carlton Inn was perfect for our overnight stay. We needed a pet friendly hotel near Midway for the night before our flight. Somewhere that would accommodate us and our 2 small dogs (Maltese). The room was very very comfortable and had everything we needed. The staff were consistently wonderful. I've travelled the globe extensively on business and can honestly say that all of the the staff we interacted with at the Carlton were as friendly, helpful and accommodating as any 5 star hotel I've stayed in. The Carlton is a 2-star hotel, but the room was very clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was a surprise because, though simple was quite varied and good. We took the shuttle to Midway. We had 5 suitcases plus the 2 dogs and their in-cabin carriers. The driver picked us up outside our room and was helpful with the bags. The Carlton was perfect for our needs and perfect for our night before our flight.
