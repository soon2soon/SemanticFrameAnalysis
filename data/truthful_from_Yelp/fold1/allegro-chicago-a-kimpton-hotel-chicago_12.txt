Hey - All Kimptons are a treat because they have a flair for design details and pick great locations and lots of old iconic buildings.  Beyond that there is a deep philosophy of treating the guests with warmth and attention. So, I was at first upset this week when they failed to provide the early wake-up call I requested.   Then ten minutes later someone knocked at my door on the 16th floor because they had been unable to reach me on the phone.  It was off the hook! Thanks to all the Kimpton teams for all the little and big things!
