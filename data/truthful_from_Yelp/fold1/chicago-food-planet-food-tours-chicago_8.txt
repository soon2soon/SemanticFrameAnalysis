I've done several food tours in Chicago with 3 separate companies. I decided to try the Chinatown food tour with Chicago Food Planet Food Tours last fall. Of all of the Chicago ones, this was by far my absolute favorite tour! We were lucky to have Jess as our tour guide. She was super upbeat and extremely knowledgeable when educating us about the culture and food of Chinatown. I had been to Chinatown before, but not on a food tour. While I think you can learn a lot by wandering the place by yourself and reading other yelp reviews, I think the food tour is the best way to really learn about this part of Chicago. This tour was a host of new experiences for me. I tried Dim Sum for the first time (I know....how could I have not known about it before????). I also learned how to pour tea, toured the "secret" garden, and tried duck for the very first time as well (yum!). While the tour is kind of expensive, I thought it was worth every penny. The only downside was the dessert. There wasn't enough for everyone so we got 2 separate desserts (and neither of them were all that special). Other than that, super fun experience! Recommendations: 1. Dress for the weather. 2. Wear comfortable shoes as you will walk quite a bit. You get to sit down at several of the stops, but you spend most of your time standing. 3. Make sure you take advantage of the stops with restrooms. 4. Be open to trying new things!
