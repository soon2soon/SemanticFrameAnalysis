We stayed here for two nights of a five night trip.  I can honestly say there was not one thing we would change.   We booked through the hotel's website and got a rate that was actually cheaper than hotels.com.  We had the opportunity to upgrade to a suite for $25, which was a fantastic decision.   The online concierge is very user friendly and convenient.  I was able to arrange a bottle of Prosecco in the room upon our arrival. The rooftop lounge is well worth the extra bucks.  Honestly the wine prices are very comparable to your average restaurant.
