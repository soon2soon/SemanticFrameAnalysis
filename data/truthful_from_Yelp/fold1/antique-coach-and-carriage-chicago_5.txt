Very nice and relaxing. Cash only, and the charge for the ride goes directly to the company so be sure to have extra to tip your coachman! Our driver was very nice, and our horse's name was Fiona. Nice trek from Michigan Ave to Lake Shore and back. But you can also choose to take your carriage ride in the city. If it's chilly out, they typically have blankets, as the first time we tried a few years ago it was freezing, but the weather this trip was gorgeous.
