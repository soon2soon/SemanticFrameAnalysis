I've taken many tours in many cities. This was the best one I've been on. Friendly guide. Interesting concept. Climate controlled comfortable bus WITH A BATHROOM. They show a whole bunch of movie clips and then show you the actual places the clip was shot. BRILLIANT! Great job for the people who created this tour. I now look at my home of Chicago with a newfound respect for it's cinema history.
