I've done 2 out of 3 of their tours: Gold Coast/Old Town, and Bucktown/Wicker Park.  Both were great experiences; they were the more memorable experiences I've had in Chicago.  If I had to choose between the 2, I liked the Gold Coast/Old Town one a bit more.  This tour introduced me to oil shops and spice shops, which earned extra points in my book.  I also generally like the Gold Coast/Old Town neighborhood more than Bucktown/Wicker Park; the landscape is prettier and closer to the beach. In general, each tour starts and ends with food items on the more filling side, like a sandwich or pizza slice.  The in between stops are filled with little snacks, like chocolate or ice cream.  There is moderate walking from shop to shop, leaving plenty of opportunity for our tour guide to sprinkle history and point out landmarks along the way.  You'll end each tour with a comfortably full belly and with some more appreciation for Chicago, both huge pluses in my book! I want to do their last tour, the Chinatown one.  My only hesitation is that it's a bit expensive at $60.  The other 2 tours are about $10 less.
