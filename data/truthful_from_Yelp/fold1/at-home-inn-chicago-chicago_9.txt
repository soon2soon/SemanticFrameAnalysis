My family was planning a reunion in Chicago and couldn't find any affordable hotel arrangements in Lincoln Park.  I found At Home Inn online and couldn't have been happier with the result.  We were able to find a huge five bedroom house that gave us a wonderful gathering place for the family and was less expensive than individual hotel rooms would have been.  It was also wonderful to be able to make breakfast together in the mornings - both for the experience of being together and because it allowed us to save money on our trip.  I would definitely use At Home Inn again if I was planning a trip to Chicago - and would use this type of service in other places as a refreshing alternative to hotels.
