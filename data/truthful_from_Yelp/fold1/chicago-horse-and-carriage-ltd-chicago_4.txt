30 minute ride for $40 + tip! It was a wonderful experience being taken around the city on a horse carriage. You can choose to take a ride by the lake or a ride in the city, we chose the lake to get away from all the traffic. But I'm sure either choice would be good. Our driver Bruno and his horse Genie were awesome!
