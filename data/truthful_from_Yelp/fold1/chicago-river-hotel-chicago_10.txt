Love this place. From what I saw while price-shopping, this is one of the cheaper places to stay that I would still feel comfortable staying in. Very clean and modern. The room is small (so is the bathroom-stand-up shower only), but I was cool with that. My room provided a great view of the river, especially at night, but it was very quiet and the shades blocked out all the light, which I loved. Free filtered water at every floor. They let me check in early for no extra charge, and every staff member I talked to was very helpful/friendly. Awesome location, close to the El (State/Lake), food, sights, shopping (Michigan and State). There wasn't free breakfast, but there is a restaurant on site.
