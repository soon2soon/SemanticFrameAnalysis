Enjoyed the two skyscraper morning segway tours this summer with bike and roll Chicago.  Bought both of the tours through the Living Social deals which made them economical.  Both of the tour leaders I experienced Jill and Andre were very knowledgeable about the city as well as personable and professional.  The first time out was with a group of my girlfriends aging from 45-62 and all enjoyed the trip with Jill who went out of her way to be sure we all felt comfortable with the use of segways before we started the trip.   When I took my boyfriend out on the trip with Andre Ellis after having such a good time previously- he made sure he held the segway for me both getting on and getting off.   Andre's passion for architecture was displayed as he told us about each building and was able to add some interesting facts about the buildings and their history.   I hope to try an evening tour next on one of the nights when there are lakefront fireworks!
