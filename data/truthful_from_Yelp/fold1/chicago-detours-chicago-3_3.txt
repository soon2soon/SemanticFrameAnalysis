I love architecture, but this is *way* more interesting to me than a standard architectural tour. You'll get some history of buildings, but what I loved in particular was more focus on putting that history in context, with the related people, cultural shifts, history of long-term businesses and institutions, etc. all presented in a super accessible way. At first I wasn't sure how much of a bonus the video & photos would be. I hadn't had that on the tour before, and it seemed like a good idea, but I think we've all had experiences where tech or other media just feels tacked-on. That was not at all the case here - the clips and pictures felt really integral to the background that Amanda, our guide, was giving, and I'd say that media didn't just compliment the tour, it helped fill it out. It was clear that it even nudged a few of my tour-mates to think about different questions related to what we were seeing and walking through. I hadn't been through the subterranean pedways before, so even just that aspect of the tour and excuse to explore something I hadn't before (but it directly under where so many people are all the time) was ingenious. Overall, I came away having had a really fun time, but also feeling like I had a lot more than just trivia to take home with me. I'd definitely try another Chicago Detours excursion in the future!
