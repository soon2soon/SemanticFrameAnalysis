I love taking out of town visitors on the architecture tour in Chicago. Previously tried Wendella's tour, but I kind of like this one better because of where it boards,  it allows for parking in the nearby Streeterville neighborhood. The tour was well run, started and ended on time, boarded orderly and was narrated well.  There were no q& a though, the guys spoke for 90 mins continuously.   For time planning, I would recommend getting the 20 mins ahead of tour time to get in line, you will get the best seats  on the top deck. Otherwise, they have seats on the bottom deck, and you may ask, how would you see the buildings in the bottom deck?  Well, we did it.  if ou snag the seats at the front row, you can see in front and above you. But if you are in the next three rows, you pretty much look towards the front and side or you can getup to stand near the edge of the boat, but you won't get that buildings all over your head photos and experience.   Book a few days ahead after you check the weather forecast.  Not fun to go on a boat in bad weather and they will run the tours rain or shine.
