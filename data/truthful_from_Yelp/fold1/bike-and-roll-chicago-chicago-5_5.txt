This tour was so much fun! We had never done anything like this before so we didn't know what to expect. Andre was out tour guide and he was awesome! So much fun to listen too when we would stop at landmarks and take our breaks! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try a Segway! I can't wait to try this again with a new group of friends and family! Two thumbs up!!!
