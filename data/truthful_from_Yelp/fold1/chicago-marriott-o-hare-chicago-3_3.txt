Friendly, clean, and spacious. This was a great choice for staying near the Rosemont MB Financial Park for a staycation. We took the blue line to the Cumberland stop and walked to the hotel from there. Then, we took it one stop to Rosemont and either walked or took the shuttle to the park. Another time we took a taxi as we were too full from dinner to move anywhere ourselves. A great location with a nice pool and very friendly staff!
