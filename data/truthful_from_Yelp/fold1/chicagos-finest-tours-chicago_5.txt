I went on a Chicago History Tour with Rick. He was really fun and knowledgeable and answered all my questions in between stops. We used Groupon for a $29 for two deal (tours are normally $30 per adult). I think it was really worth it since we walked a good length of the river and I like learning nerdy history stuff. Everyone gets a bottle of water and a headset so we can hear him when we're in noisy parts of the city. He also carried umbrellas for anyone on the tour to use, and small Hershey's chocolates to give out in the middle of the tour. You are in the sun a decent amount and walking about 40% of the time, but it doesn't feel tiring at all because he always stops to talk for a while, often in spots where you can sit. The umbrellas are definitely useful. He ends by dropping you off on a river tour and you relax and see the sites from the water vantage point.
