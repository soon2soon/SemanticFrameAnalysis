BEST CAR RENTAL OUT OF ORD!!!  Originally I was booked with Hertz but they had an insanely long line with 1 stupid worker behind the counter. While I was on line for a non moving 10 minutes, I read the awful review of Hertz so then I moved on to Alamo because I had to a car ASAP to head to the western burbs of Chicago. Rental was quick and smooth. I went during a busy time and there was a short line but it was moving. The front desk only has room for I think 3 workers but a woman who looked like a Manager came out to help get customers out the door via the self serve kiosks. Once you're checked out, you can go out to the lot and pick out your own car. The manager looking lady who was previously helping customers inside was now out on the lot helping get these same customers out of the lot and on their way...now that's service!  Coming back, the check in people were great. The driver of a car that pulled up behind me forgot a camera on the front seat and the check-in person spotted it and got it back to her. A+ STAFF!!!
