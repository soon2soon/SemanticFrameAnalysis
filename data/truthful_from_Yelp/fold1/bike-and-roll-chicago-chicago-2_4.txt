Reason why they get 5 stars is how they handle a problem that they created. We had a tour set for 10:30am and was suppose to meet at navy pier but 5 mins before the tour I got a call and they inform me that the person called in sick and they would not be opening that spot until later.  They asked me if I could go to there spot at millennium park which I said ok and they inform me that the tour would wait.  My wife and I got there at 10:50am and the tour had already left and they inform me they would upgrade us to the Segway tour which I was happy about but at the same time scared for my wife because I didn't know if she would be able to steer one. She did great except one mishap but it wasn't too bad.  So as a company they took care of the problem and the guide Jill made it great. Which made this customer HAPPY
