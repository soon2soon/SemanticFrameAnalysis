My experience with boutique hotels has been hit or miss, so I was somewhat tentative in staying at the Affinia Chicago.  Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised and would happily recommend this hotel.  All staff was warm, friendly, just very welcoming.  The room was very clean and we had a great view of the city.  The location was perfect...a block away from the Magnificent Mile and a 24-hour Walgreen's was around the corner, so it was very convenient.  C-House restaurant was excellent - we ate there 4 times and each time did not disappoint.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
