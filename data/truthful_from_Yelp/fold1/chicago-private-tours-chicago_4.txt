Went on two tours specifically organized for our tour group of 17.  We covered the city and north on the first tour, and a couple of days later the southside of Chicago. Matt & Mike were great!!  Personable, knowledgeable, charming, funny, helpful, couldn't ask for better guides.  We asked lots of questions and if they didn't know the answers, they looked them up!  For some of us it was our second visit to the city, regardless, we learned and saw lots of new things.  They gave us a great overview of the city, highly recommend Chicago Private Tours for anyone travelling to Chicago.
