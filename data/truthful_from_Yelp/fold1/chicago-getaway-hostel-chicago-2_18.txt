Wow! One of the best hostels I have ever stayed in. Everything is super clean and well-maintained--and stylish. Free continental breakfast, free WiFi, lockers in each room (bring your own lock and key, obvs). They organize pub crawls and stuff as well, which are very fun. This hostel is in the Lincoln Park neighborhood so there's plenty to explore in the immediate area. It seems kind of far from the city center BUT it's a straight shot by bus to get to it--maybe 20 minutes...? My stay here was awesome and I'll definitely book a room here again.
