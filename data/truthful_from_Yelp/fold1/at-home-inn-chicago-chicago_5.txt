Highest recommendation.  I had a few friends coming into town and couldn't fit everyone in my condo.  Then after looking at ads on Craigslist, I almost fell for a vacation rental scam.  As the date drew near I started to really stress but then I found At Home Inn Chicago.  Tessa was a great help and very professional.  The place she recommended for my group was PERFECT. Very clean, fantastic location and well outfitted with everything we could possibly need during our stay.  She met me at the residence and walked us through how to use everything and was available 24/7 during our stay in case we had any problems.  The next time I have a group of friends or family visiting, this will be the first call I make.
