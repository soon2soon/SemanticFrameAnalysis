This bike tour was a lot of fun. Daniella, our tour guide, was full of energy and kept everyone engaged. I felt it was just the right balance of getting some light exercise, taking breaks to learn about Chicago, and savoring a few local bites and brews. One mistake I made was to eat a big breakfast before going on the tour. They feed you a giant slice of deep dish pizza, pretty much right away, so it's a good idea to come kinda hungry. We cycled from their office, near Navy Piers, up through Lincoln Park, and back to the office along a different route. We were blessed with awesome, sunny weather, which made it that much more enjoyable. The view of the deep-blue Lake Michigan was breathtaking as we rode along the lakeside trail.
