I searched around for a while online, looking for a service I felt I could trust with my passport, since I needed a Chinese visa added.   After a couple hours I came to the conclusion that I just couldn't tell based off websites and reviews. All of them had good reviews and bad reviews, so I was overwhelmed. My husband travels a lot for work, so I asked him who they use. It was a different company than this one. I went to their site and started filling out the application, but at the end, they wanted to charge over $450 for a non-rush visa by the time it was all said and done (miscellaneous fees, shipping, etc.). Ridiculous! My husband told me his company sometimes used another service, so I tried it out. It was A. Briggs. The fees are just the consular fee, the shipping (inbound and outbound), and a MUCH smaller service fee. This totaled to $200 LESS than the other place. I filled out the online form to start the process.  Got a few emails further describing the documents needed and giving me a link to a form I could fill out and print for the visa application. Put it all in an envelope with my passport and extra photo required. Used the shipping label that came in email. Received an email the next day when they received it. Went to their website to check its status. They gave an expected date that they would ship it back to me. On that date, they shipped it back. For once in my life, everything worked the way it was supposed to!!  No unexpected delays, no extra fees in the small print!  I highly recommend this service if you aren't sure about who to use. In fact, my husband said he's going to switch to this one, since it's so much cheaper than the other and even an easier process to follow.
