I could go into all the little details that many Yelpers have already mentioned, but I'll save you the trouble. Yes, it's remodeled and modern. No tacky, bright colors, etc., etc. Yep, the bar situation is weird and so are the drink coins. But I'm not going to hate on free drinks, whether paid with coins, in a fancy lounge or a weird conference room made to look like a bar (which almost seemed the case here.) So no docking of stars for that. I'm not giving Kinzie the 5-stars for the fanciness or lushness of the hotel. It was just boutique-y and nice. Where they really shine in the 5-star realm is their service. After returning from a vacation in Vegas the week before and shelling out my own hard-earned money to only get treated like a tourist in a VERY fancy hotel there, the down-to-earth, glad-YOU-are-here service of Kinzie was a much needed surprise. From the moment I entered the hotel I was treated like they had been excitedly waiting for me to get there. Yes! Being treated to 4 drink coins and showed to my room were just a few of the perks. The 24- hour, badass fitness room access was much appreciated as well as the mega-awesome free breakfast on every floor and the free Wi-Fi. You don't just feel like a guest when you stay here--you feel like they're really excited for you to be there. One specific moment of epic service that comes top-of-mind was when I was actually trying to find a taxi the morning I had to fly out. It was freezing cold outside and snowing heavily, but that didn't stop the concierge from running around in the slippery streets of downtown Chicago during rush hour traffic for at least 30 minutes trying to find me a taxi--with nothing but his suit and dress shoes on, no less. I was in a frantic, panicked rush but his desire to help me made me stop and realize how awesome it was to have such dedicated service. Holy cow. I would definitely recommend staying here if great service that doesn't feel fake or corporate, but genuine is your thing.
