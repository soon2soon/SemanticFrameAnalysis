I took a tour of Millennium Park with the instagreeter.  This was totally free and a wonderful tour.  Our volunteer guide was engaging and knowledgable.  I learned about the history of the park and the surrounding areas in a way that was very interesting. Again, this is free.  What a wonderful service.  I can't wait to recommend this to my friends who travel to Chicago.
