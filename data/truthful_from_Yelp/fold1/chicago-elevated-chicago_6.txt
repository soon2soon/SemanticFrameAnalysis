I went on the Pedway tour with Margaret. I have lived in or near Chicago most of my life and never knew that such an extensive and bizarre system of walkways existed. She also introduced me to the Chicago Cultural Center, a beautiful building with awesome exhibits that you can just hang out in for free. Margaret was fun, knowledgeable, and full of enthusiasm for Chicago. I definitely want to go on her Redlight tour soon.
