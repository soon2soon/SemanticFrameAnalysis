I booked this tour hoping to get good food and an idea of the lay of the land since it was my first trip to Chicago. It easily blew my expectations out of the water! Kevin was our tour guide and he was friendly, funny and knowledgeable. The pizzas got better and better as we went along and the drinks were included, which was lovely. I even got a double shot at one stop for no extra charge. The group was a mix of tourists and locals, all friendly and happy to be there. Would definitely recommend it, especially if you're new to Chicago.
