Me and my friend, tourists in town, were lured in by mutual curiosity, of both segways and segway tours.  Well, much to our surprise, we had a blast.  Yes, you're going to look like a pretentious doofus riding a segway.  A pretentious doofus riding a segway wearing a bright orange safety helmet.  BUT, despite that, the segways were a ton of fun to ride, and the tour of the parks and surrounding city was fantastic.  The price seemed steep to me, but the tour is long, they give you a bunch of time for training on the segways, and the views are splendid.  Shout out to our tour guide Kate!
