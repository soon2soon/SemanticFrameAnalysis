We really enjoyed our stay for a long weekend at the Kinzie.  We got a great rate through Hotwire and always enjoy a great surprise when we book this way.  Location was great - a bit outside the loop, nice restaurants all around, 7-11 to grab a soda for a snack and Divvy bikes at the corner.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were well appointed with a comfy king bed, small couch and ottoman, desk, nice bathroom with little vanity section and vanity mirror.   We really enjoyed the happy hour and actually received a few additional tokens from guests who couldn't use them.  We gave our extras to a guest as well.  The snacks at happy hour were a nice touch too so that you could nibble while you enjoy a cocktail before dinner.  Breakfast on the floor each morning was very convenient too.  It offered a nice selection of breads and pastries you could toast, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal, juice and coffee.  In your room you have a tray to use to bring your breakfast back, sit on your couch and enjoy breakfast in your pj.   Let me share a little tip to close - be sure to close our shades because this is a city hotel so the next building is feet away.  We laughed pretty hard when we realized there was a cardboard cutout that looked like a kid with binoculars in the window of the building next store. Too funny!
