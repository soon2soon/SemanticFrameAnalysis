Went here for my husband's birthday this past weekend. I started chatting with the woman who was checking me in and casually mentioned that it was my husband's birthday. She gave us our room keys and we were on our way.  Upon returning to our room later that evening, we found a bucket with champagne and 2 bottles of sparking water, as well as a platter with a chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sauce and fresh strawberries!  Along side of it was a note that said "Happy B-day from the Hotel Allegro cast & crew"!  What a delightful surprise!!!   The room was spacious and clean. The public areas of the hotel were clean and very nicely decorated. We had such a great experience that we decided to extend our stay one more night. When we returned later that night, we were personally greeted (how they remembered our name is beyond me!) and when we got back to the room we found another note that said "Happy b-day, thank you for extending your stay", this time with a bottle of wine!!!   The staff at this hotel is fantastic!! I would highly recommend this hotel.
