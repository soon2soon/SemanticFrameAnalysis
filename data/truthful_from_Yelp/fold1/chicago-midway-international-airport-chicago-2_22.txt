Ah Midway let me count the ways I love thee...1) Your close to the CTA from my home and one transfer later I'm here.  2) You serve beer and good beers at that.  3) TSA is still a little rude but the secert to getting a smile from those guys is asking "How are you?" Works everytime. 4) No crazy crowd + Wednesday night = not so crazy. 5) You have Southwest Airlines Their are more reasons but these are my top five. Thank you for not being O'Hare.
