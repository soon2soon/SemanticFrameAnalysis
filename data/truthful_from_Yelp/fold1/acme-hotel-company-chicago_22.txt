First time at the Acme. This will be the hotel I stay at when in Chicago. Staff was great. Got an upgraded room... No extra charge.  Very clean. Loved the vibe. SUPER CLOSE to everything. We went into a couple of hotel bars to drink and the Acme was by far the best. Beds were comfy. Free wi-fi. Iron and hair dryer. Plenty of room for us. The knock and drop coffee was super cool. Put your order in for coffee the night before and they drop it at your door step -- no charge! News paper showed up with my coffee. Parking ramp was reasonably priced. We checked out at 11am front desk said for an extra $10 we could stay in the ramp for six more hours. We stayed in the ramp for a few  hours and kicked around the Mag-Mile to shop and eat.  You will love it...
