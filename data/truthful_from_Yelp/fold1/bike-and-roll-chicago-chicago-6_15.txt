My husband and I used a Groupon to purchase a Hyde Park segway tour through Bike and Roll.  The staff from check in to the tour guide was courteous, friendly, and helpful.  Dave, our tour guide, did a great job of making sure we could all safely use our segways before we took off--he was very patient and helpful as we worked on getting our balance and maneuvering the machines.  He was also very informative and had great knowledge and enthusiasm for the neighborhood.  Also good--there were only seven of us on the tour, so we could always hear the guide both along the way and at all of our pit stops.
