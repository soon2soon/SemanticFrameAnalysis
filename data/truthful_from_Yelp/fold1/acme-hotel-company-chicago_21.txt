A must stay if you are traveling to Chicago!!! Beautifully modernized hotel with a retro, funky, youthful twist yet still perfect for any age. Room was clean and well organized. There are no closets but the wardrobe area provided was sufficient enough for a three night stay. Â My husband and I stayed in the king suite with a view. The view faced Ohio Street from the attached living room. Personally I loved the wood floors throughout as I find that to be very hygienic compared to carpet found even in the ritziest of hotels. Centrally located to the red line and walking distance to local attractions. Parking garage is literally right next door with the as advertised $39 a day. Staff was friendly and helpful. Any negative comments or experiences are definitely isolated incidences because our stay was phenomenal!! XOXO
