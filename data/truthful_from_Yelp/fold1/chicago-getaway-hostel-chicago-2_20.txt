Coming to Chicago I decided I'd rather spend $200 a week for a hotel instead of $200 a day and with that I found this Hostel. This was my first Hostel experience and if they are all like this I will never stay anywhere other than a hostel again.   The rooms weren't high class, but you shouldn't expect that when you're spending less than $30 a night.  I shared a room on the lower level there were 8 bunks and we had our own bathroom.  It was perfect for what I needed, somewhere to crash after a long long day out on the town.  Any time I spent at the hostel not sleeping was in a common area which were all clean and nice with plenty of comfy seating.  This was my favorite part spending time in the common rooms playing pool with guys from all over the world.  I've made life long friends from this hostel and I can't wait to come back and make more. The staff was beyond friendly and at 5 in the morning when we were still up playing pool they were making jokes and playing piano for us.  They had breakfast in the morning and bbq on the weekends(I think the bbq is during the summer only).  They put together pub crawls and really got to know the guests while we were there. All in all HIGHLY recommend this place if you want to have fun and meet some new people. I do NOT recommend this place if you want your alone time in a nice plush hotel room.
