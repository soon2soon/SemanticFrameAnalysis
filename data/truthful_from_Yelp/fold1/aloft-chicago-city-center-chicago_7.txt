Such a great hotel right in the middle of it all! Its quite trendy, so if you like conservative hotels like the Fairmont, this isn't the place for you. But as far as a fun place to experience Chicago and all it has to offer this is a wonderful place to stay. The rooms are quite small, but they are set up in such a way that it doesn't matter. The beds, pillows, TV and soaps and toiletries are all top notch . Staff were very friendly and helpful and getting a taxi is a snap. For the price paid this is a great value. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Chicago.
