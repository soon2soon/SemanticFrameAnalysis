This was a great experience!  Justin our tour guide was friendly, helpful and full of great tour information.  He also was knowledgable about the area and able to give recommendations about places to see and things to do when asked.  The Segway is easy to learn and it is great to be able to see so much in the time given.  Still didn't want to get off though, fun ride.
