An age old form of transportation has given tourists and locals a different view of this great city. It's perfect for any season, for a romantic moment, to be shared with friends, or just one of those things you need to do at least once in your life. I can't speak for all the other carriages, but this company has been around for nearly 20 years now. They mostly cover the lakefront and goldcoast area, providing rides for tours, proms, weddings, parades, or just a nice stroll around. Rates aren't that expensive (at least in my eyes for what you get), $40 for a half hour and $80 for the full (plus tip). Lucky for us we had a Groupon, so my date, myself and another couple (plus a bottle of champagne) set off. You have to call to make an appointment, though I'm sure there has to be somewhere in the city that you can just do a walk up. You then meet your carriage at whatever location they tell you on the phone and hop in. Our coachman was nice enough to give us the option of the scenic route (which can be noisy and full of traffic) or the quite route (not as scenic but very quite). I was pleasantly surprised how relaxing the whole experience was, even with us getting crazy with the champagne. I was also surprised on how warm it actually was in the carriage, it was in the 40's with a nice wind but all it took was a blanket (which they provide) to keep warm and of course each other. Â  What a great experience, you should book your trip today!!
