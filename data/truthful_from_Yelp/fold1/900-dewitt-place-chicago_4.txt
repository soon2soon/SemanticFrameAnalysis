Shhhh don't tell too many people or you might not be able to get a room next time you visit Chicago! $135.00 a night compared to every where else at $200.00 a night! The building is located around the corner from The Drake hotel, 1 block from the lake and in order to get to the lake it's a small walk, the Contemporary Museum within walking distance, Millennium Park and Art Institute is a 10 minute bus ride, Magnificent Mile is 2 blocks away. You get the idea. It's centrally located, well priced, welcoming staff, a kitchen so you can save some money on making your own coffee and breakfast in the morning, Not fancy but you go to see Chicago not your hotel room, right!
