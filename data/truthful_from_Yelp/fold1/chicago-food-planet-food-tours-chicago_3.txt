I would consider this my first "real" food tour experience, and this is exactly what I envisioned a food tour should be. I did the Bucktown/Wicker park tour and above all else, it was fun, engaging, and the food choices were excellent. Christina, our guide, was charismatic and knowledgable and did an outstanding job. I was impressed by how much I learned, from the history of the Chicago dog (that is, the hot dog) to the origins of the name "Bucktown," from the personal stories of the owners of each establishment to the history of some Victorian-style houses in Wicker Park... I feel like you get more than your money's worth with this tour. I was expecting small samples from each stop along the way, but we were given solid portions--definitely come hungry! (My favorite was a toss up between the James Beard winner's Hot Chocolate, made with melted milk chocolate and hints of caramel--a decadent treat for a chilly day!--and iCream's made-for-you on the spot ice cream of white chocolate and cream soda mixed with nutella ["that guy from Florida".) I appreciated the fact that there was a decent-length walk between the 4th and 5th location to let our food settle and learn more about the neighborhoods near the eateries. I found this to be an extremely well-organized and well thought-out tour, with a clear camaraderie between tour operators and the establishments we visited. But any tour like this is truly brought to life by the tour guide, and Christina deserves a super hard high five for making it a memorable and exciting afternoon. Whether you're visiting for a weekend or live locally and just want to see what cool spots are in different areas of the city, you should definitely check it out. Chicago Food Tours has my 100% recommendation.
