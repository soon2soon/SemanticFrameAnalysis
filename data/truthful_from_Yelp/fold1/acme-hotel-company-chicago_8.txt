I loved everything about this hotel.. d√©cor, staff, rooms, toiletries, the Berkshire room, beds, pillows, robes, free coffee delivery, location, bakery, and I could go on and on. Location was fantastic and our conference, dining, and shopping was all within walking distance. Loved being able to park the car and not drive again til we headed home.
