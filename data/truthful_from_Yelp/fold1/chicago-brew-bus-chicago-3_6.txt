Me and my husband were spending 4 of July with friends from Chicago. I don't drink at all and I got the news that she book us a brewing tour. I was kind of skeptical about it, but as soon as we got in the bus, it was soo much fun! Nick was our "tour guy". Everybody had a great energy and the Bluetooth on the bus it's definitely a plus! I will definitely do it again next time that I'm in Chicago!
