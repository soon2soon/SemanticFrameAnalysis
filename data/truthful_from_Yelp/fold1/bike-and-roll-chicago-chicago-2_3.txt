I took my 15-year-old sister on the Segway tour and we had SO much fun! Todd, our tour guide, was extremely patient in teaching us all how to ride the Segways and made sure we all felt super comfortable before we departed on the tour. We did the sunset tour, and Todd was knowledgeable and funny the whole time, and offered to take lots of pictures at every stop. Highly recommend him for a fun and relaxed tour. My only thought is perhaps starting the 'sunset' tour a bit earlier, because for the most part we were Segway-ing at night.
