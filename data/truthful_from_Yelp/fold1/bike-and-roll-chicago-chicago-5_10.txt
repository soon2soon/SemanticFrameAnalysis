This review is for an October 2011 Segway tour with Jamie. As a first time Segwayer, I had no idea what to expect.  The experience was outstanding in every way.  You start by grabbing a helmet and carefully getting on the Segway.  There is ample time to practice before hitting the road.  We covered a lot of ground (followed the riverwalk to the lake, and followed alongside the lake as far south as Northerly Island/Soldier's Field, then came back on an inland route up Columbus).  Among the areas we got to see or visit were Navy Pier (from a distance), the Museum Campus/Soldier Field, Buckingham Fountain, the Gehry-designed Pritzker Pavilion, and the area around the new Aqua Tower by Jeanne Gang.  Our guide Jamie was great... the total package really. He was patient, friendly, and quite knowledgeable about the architecture of Chicago. The only downside is that my toes and feet kept cramping up.  We did stop a couple of times to get off the Segway and stretch our feet, but for me it wasn't enough. Everyone else in our group (group size was 7) was fine, so no biggie.
