I had purchased a Groupon for a 90 minute Grant Park Segway Tour from this company so I thought I'd try this company.  I've taken a Segway tour last year from another company so I already knew what to except. Booking of this tour was very painless which was great.  This company is based  at the southeast corner of the Millennium  Park.  The office is couple of level below ground - the signs for the office were very visible.  The actual check-in was very painless.  They gave you a form to read and sign - just for liability purpose.  From there, we all watched a 5 - 10 minute video.  After that, we were divided up into three different groups since there were so many of us. I was in Dustin's group.  Since I was the only one with experience, I was  the "demonstrator" of the group.  Riding a Segway is just like riding a bike - it comes right back to you.  Before any of the groups departed on their tour, we all knew how to ride one of this devices.   We went through Grant Park, stopped at the Buckingham Fountain, then proceeded along the lake to the Shedd Aquarium, zoomed along the walks in that area before we headed back to the office.   The entire tour was about 90 minutes once we got out of training.  I would highly recommend a segway tour!!  So much fun!!
