Finally got around to reviewing Bobby's Bike HIke Tours after almost a year! Had so much fun on our Bites, Bikes, and Brews tour!  We were fortunate because my group of friends and I were the only ones who booked that tour on a chilly October Sunday--Mike aka Best Tour Guide ever, really customized our bike ride for us.  He served as tour guide, travel adviser, photographer, and safety patrol agent all in one! We got to try so much good food with no wait.  We would just arrive at the restaurant or bar and bam, food was there waiting for us.  Such a good deal, that even though we biked almost 15 miles, we got so much food and beer that we were stuffed by the end of it! I felt like we saw more than we ever could on one of those hop off hop on buses, the "L" or even tour bus because the bikes helped us navigate through tight streets and one-ways.  On our hit list--about 3 different breweries, an awesome hot dog place, deep dish pizza place, cupcake place, wrigley field, navy pier, the zoo, hugh heffner's old house, and about 10 other places that I can't remember. Mike definitely deserves a bonus cuz at one point, some obnoxious driver decided to honk us for about 7-8 blocks (instead of go around us).  Mike took it in stride, calmly and professionally spoke to the nutty driver, and made sure that we were always safe.  Some older man walking down the street got so irritated with that honker that he crossed the street, stopped him, and yelled, "HEY!  It's SUNDAY!" Unfortunate-ness aside, it was VERY enjoyable.  A definite highlight of our trip!
