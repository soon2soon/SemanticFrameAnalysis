Lovely wife and I were there for NBEA Teacher's Conference for 8 days.  This was a fantastic experience in all ways.  Starting with Danielle at the front desk. She went out her way and was incredibly professional.  Maria Garcia was our housekeeper for the entire time and was an absolute joy.  Always concerned how our room looked and even called one time to make sure everything was alright. We used the concierge service almost every day.  Customer service seems to be the priority here at this Hotel and it shines.  The waitress in The Harvest restaurant was very nice and helped us with places to see around the city. Beautiful room. Impecable service. Professional employees. Can't wait to return.
