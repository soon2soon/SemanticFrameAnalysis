Architectural cruise is a must.   I'm not into architecture, and questioned if this would be a long 1.5 hours.  To the contrary, was surprised when we got back because it went so quickly.   Very interesting; Marshall was an incredibly knowledgable and entertaining guide.  I've visited Chicago many times and now wonder why I didn't take this tour previously.
