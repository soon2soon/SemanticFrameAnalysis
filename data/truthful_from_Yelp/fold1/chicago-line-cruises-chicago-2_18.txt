I can't tell you how many people told me I had to take an architectural tour of Chicago as I was planning my trip. And how right they all were. Everything came together perfectly. I narrowed it down to two companies (there are many) based on Yelp reviews. Turns out a friend and the exceedingly helpful concierge at my hotel, both recommended this one as the best of the bunch. Chicago Cruise Lines partners with the Chicago History Museum and our docent was excellent. I wasn't looking for a jokey tour of Chicago (ala Vince Vaughn in The Breakup) and I would call this tour educational and informative rather than a yuckfest. Although I wouldn't want you to misinterpret that as it being dry or boring. Chicago history and architecture is so interesting, it just doesn't need a lot of embellishment. The Chicago River is so dense with interesting buildings and history that she essentially talked nonstop during the 90-minute tour. Most questions had to wait until the end when we were disembarking because there just aren't any gaps with nothing to say. We spent about 10 minutes with her discussing Chicago history and getting other recommendations about what to see and she was wonderfully helpful. I recommend you book in advance to reserve a spot and if you reserve online you'll save $2 a ticket. We also arrived 30 minutes in advance of the tour so we could board early and get good seats. There are two decks, but you won't have nearly the same experience if you are on the lower level. Our tour was during the Chicago Marathon so we had the extra fun of cheering on runners as we cruised under bridges and saw couples taking their wedding photos along the route. Coffee, soda, muffins and cookies are included in the tour price and are served on the lower level. There are many ways to see Chicago. We experienced it exhaustively by foot, rail and bike. This was one of the most enjoyable, relaxing and informative.
