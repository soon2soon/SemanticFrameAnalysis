What a great way to spend our Saturday morning and afternoon. My husband and I booked the Chicago Brews Cruise with zero expectations aside from trying out new beers from breweries we've never heard of. All I have to say now is that it was definitely money well spent... bus was comfortable, the guide was friendly and extremely knowledgeable, and the three breweries we went to were worth the trip. I felt that we went beer gulping more that beer tasting because the servings were pretty hefty. I would do this all over again, mostly for the rides to different breweries and the continued ed. on the beer making process. Pretty darn interesting! 100% recommended it!
