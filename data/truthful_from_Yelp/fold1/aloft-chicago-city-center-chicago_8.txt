What matters to me is a clean room and a good sleep. Aloft had both. Check-In was quick n easy. The parking garage was close to the hotel and the Aloft parking discount is decent. It's in a great area and just around the corner is the Grand red line stop. I only stayed for one night, which was Fourth of July, and for such a busy weekend the hotel staff didn't seem bothered. Everyone was friendly and accommodating.
