I am also a regular with Chicago Majestic.   Everyone there is unbelievably helpful.  Special thanks to Sam, Lisa, and Joe for getting us to and from O'Hare countless times for business trips.  They've also taken us for a couple nights out in the city and one very cold NYE.  You will not find anyone better.
