I can't speak for their repair or rental service and prices but I can sing their praises about their bike tour! Besides U of C and the museum, I have never really spent too much time exploring the Hyde Park neighborhood. The best way to see things is to sign up for a tour with this place. We covered a lot of ground in a relatively short amount of time. Vincent was our guide. He loves the Hyde Park neighborhood and his passion for it really was made obvious throughout the tour. He was fun and very thorough with his Â narrative during the tour.
