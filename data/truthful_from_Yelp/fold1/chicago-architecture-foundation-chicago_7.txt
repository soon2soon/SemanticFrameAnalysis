Since everyone loves the official architecture river cruise, I won't repeat what everything else has to say about the Architecture River Cruise. It was wonderful and I'm so thankful I had the chance to do it - I'll just give a few helpful tips. -Arrive 40 mins early to queue and check the board to make sure you're at the right dock. -Even though there are seat numbers on your tickets, those are not assigned seats. I guess that may just be they keep track of how many tickets remain. -Layers! It can go from hot to cold depending on where you are (in shade or not), so you'll want to easily get comfy no matter the temp. -Sunscreen or a hat is a good idea if it seems like it may be sunny. Our guide did a wonderful job, and he knew so much about each and every building it seemed. He talked really fast to be able to get it all in, and he certainly seemed like he knew a ton more than he had time to talk about! Knowing they are all volunteers is pretty impressive as well. The boat was nice, my drink was delicious and just an all around wonderful time!
