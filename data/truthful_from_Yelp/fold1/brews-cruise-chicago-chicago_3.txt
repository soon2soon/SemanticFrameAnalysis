Love Chicago? Love beer? Brews Cruise Chicago is an awesome way to see some of the many breweries around Chicago, and drink beer while doing it! Rick is an amazing tour guide, very knowledgeable and friendly. He offers many different types of tours - we went on the South Chicagoland brewery tour. We saw three different breweries and got to try several beers at each! It was a super fun Sunday - we learned a lot about different brewery set ups while enjoying great conversation, great beer and friendly people. Recommended!
