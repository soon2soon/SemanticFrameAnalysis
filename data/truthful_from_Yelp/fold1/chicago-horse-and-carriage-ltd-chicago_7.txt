I'm reposting this because the original isn't showing up for some reason.  I'm planning on another ride with them soon for an anniversary, so I'll have a chance to re-rate them after a second ride soon :) When researching the most romantic places in Chicago for marriage proposals, I came upon Chicago Horse & Carriage's Engagement Package.  It was a little pricey compared to their normal rates, but they made a special effort to keep the surprise by stopping the carriage at your designated spot to offer to take a picture, and when you get out, you propose.  They also give your new fiancee a dozen roses and a congratulations.  Stacey at CHC was very helpful and responsive, which made the arrangement read more » very easy.  Highly recommended for a romantic evening ride with your spouse or loved one.
