This place has the best customer service of ANY hotel I've ever been to. I arrived earlier than expected days before my reservation and they not only found me a room it was a huge upgrade and they gave me the same price of my original reservation. Get to the concierge lounge the breakfast and afternoon snacks worth it! I can't say enough of how accomodating the staff are. They treated me like they were hooking up a family member. I've traveled a bunch and never had this level of service in places with 5 star rating. Don't let the exterior fool you great place to stay.
