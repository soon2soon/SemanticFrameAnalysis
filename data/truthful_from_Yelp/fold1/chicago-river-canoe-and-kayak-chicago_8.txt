My husband and I did the Moonlight Dinner Paddle last night and really enjoyed it.  We live in Lincoln Square so the launch spot just south of Addison at Rockwell was really convenient for us.   Upon our arrival, everything was very well organized - we were checked in, confirmed which boats we had selected and received our life jackets.  The guide, Liam, was great.  He explained everything clearly before we headed out on the water and spent time during the ride chatting with people and answering any questions about the ride and the wildlife we saw along the way (herons, geese, ducks, racoons).   We paddled for about 1h15 or so before arriving at River Park.  When we arrived, dinner had been delivered and was all set up on a lovely grassy area along the river.  I love that they order from a local neighborhood restaurant, Noon-o-kabob.  It was delicious! After eating and relaxing for about 45 minutes, we set back downstream for the return trip, which took about a half hour.  It was fun paddling in the dark and the headlamps helped us spot wildlife on the shores (they provide some headlamps but we brought our own). I highly recommend the dinner paddle - the route is peaceful and serene and the staff is fantastic.
