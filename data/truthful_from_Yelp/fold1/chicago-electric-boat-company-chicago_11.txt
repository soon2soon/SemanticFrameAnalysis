No better way to enoy the river and see the city. Affordable, convenient, something different than your usual tourist trap boat excursion.  Fun for kids or bring dinner/drinks and enjoy with friends.   Staff helpful, Patrick was so nice. All the kids got a toy from the treasure box I was initially nervous because I've never driven a boat but my worries were for nothing - it was like driving a golf cart.  Boat only goes 8 mi/hr max so driving easy!  If you hire a captain they can go out on the lake and you can relax and enjoy BYOB.
