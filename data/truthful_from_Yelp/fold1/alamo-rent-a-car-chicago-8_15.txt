I recently rented an SUV for four days from Alamo at O'Hare in Chicago.  For some strange reason the SUV's were priced much lower than tiny little cars.  I could not possibly be happier with Alamo.  I've used Enterprise for probably 20 years but decided to give Alamo a shot on this trip.  When I walked out of baggage claim at O'Hare a bus to Alamo was immediately available.  They share buses with National.  The driver was cheerful and courteous (also on the return trip).  At the office I was in and out in just a few minutes because the manager (I think) pulled me and someone else out of line and checked us in.  Kudos to him.  The leased vehicle was a Nissan product with very low miles.  The drop off was quick and painless. I don't know what else to say other than Alamo gets five stars from me. Well done.
