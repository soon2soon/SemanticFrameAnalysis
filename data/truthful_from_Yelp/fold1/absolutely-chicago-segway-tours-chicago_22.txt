Loved our tour! I decided to book a segway tour as a surprise for my husband during our short stay in Chicago. I found some deals on livingsocial Â with other groups however as I read their reviews on Yelp, I decided against it due to many negative reviews. I came across Absolutely Chicago Segway Tours via Yelp. After reading all the great reviews I went to the website and was about to book a tour when I found a coupon online and actually called the company and they booked it via the phone so I can apply the coupon. Long story short, it was an hour tour guide with the BEST tour guide ever, ask for Paul! We saw so much of Chicago, he was great in teaching us how to ride the segway, helpful, funny and so patient. In all it was it the second best activity (after seeing the Bulls play) we did while we were vacationing. We'll definitely plan another tour if we go back with this company.
