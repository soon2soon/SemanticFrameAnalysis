One more customer service award. The Chicago Motor Club AAA office. I had to go there to pick up an International Driver's License.  Walked in one afternoon, made the request, they took my pic, and Sha-zam, about five minutes and $15.00 later the whole thing was done. I couldn't believe it! Now maybe I just had thoughts of the Illinois DVM preparing me for the worst, but that was the fastest most efficient service I have had lately in this city of too many stop signs, stop lights, colliding one way streets and speed bumps. No speed bumps at the "Triple A."  It's a virtual autobahn of customer satisfaction. And just an additional note, the office I went to was 307 N. Michigan, and not the one listed here.
