This was the highlight of my trip! We did the "Tower to Tower" tour with Marlin and Megan.  They took great pictures (for free!  Uploaded to their Flickr, but we have full rights), provided the beverage of our choice and had a wealth of knowledge about the area. I'm a slow runner (11:30 min./mile) and they did not push me to go faster than I wanted.  This was a huge relief at it was 90 degrees out and I was dying!  It was a 6 mile run, which was a bit challenging towards the end, but only due to the heat. If you are a runner, sign up for a tour with them!
