We didn't have a Groupon, but we had a terrific time!  This little cruiser was fantastic, even with some wakes caused by the water taxis.  It was a great afternoon to cruise through the River!!  We had 8 people it was perfect.  You bring your on snacks and beverages, the sell ice, give you a cooler to use....It was great!  Well Done
