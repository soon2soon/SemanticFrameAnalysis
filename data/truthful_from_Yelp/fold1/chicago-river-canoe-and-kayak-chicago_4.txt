Went on the Skyscraper Canyon Tour with my girlfriend last weekend and had an awesome time! Easy place to find with very friendly staff. Liam and Jessica guided our tour of about 12 people. Jessica was very nice and knowledgeable about the city and Liam was about as witty and funny as they come. One thing I liked about the tour in comparison to others was that we didn't have designated spots to stop and listen to a lecture about the history/architecture of the city. While the staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the cit and encouraged questions, we didn't have to sit and take in a bunch of information we'd forget five minutes later. I do enjoy learning about the city, but this was a great way to just get out and take it all in. Highly recommend this company and tour for a weekend afternoon.
