I went on the tour with my daughter, although I do not consume alcoholic beverages.  (Non-drinkers pay a reduced fee).  Overall, I found the tour educational and entertaining.  Our tour guide did a superb job explaining the science (or art) of beer making and the history of breweries in Chicago.  Visiting the various taverns in the neighborhood was fun and the people who run them are very friendly.
