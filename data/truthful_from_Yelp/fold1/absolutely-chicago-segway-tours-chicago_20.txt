One of the best ways to see Chicago! This segway tour honestly was the best one.  How do I know?  Well, all the tours kind of meet in the same areas.  They go down the same paths, the congregate in the same areas, and they all have their own flair.  This tour guide didn't really need all that, they just have some honest good, hard working people that work there.   Our tour guide was really nice, funny, informative, and could get along with the teenagers to the newly retired!! He was patient with those who needed an extra lesson and didn't yell at you too loudly if you rode on the grass (but really stay off the grass).   In other companies, I saw them line the groups up like a military, while ours were having fun, staying in the general area together, but kind of had more FREEDOM.  If you're on vacation, isn't that what you want? The view is fantastic, you get to see the skyline and you can go through the park.  It's fun, it's easy, it's safe AND we got a discount :)
