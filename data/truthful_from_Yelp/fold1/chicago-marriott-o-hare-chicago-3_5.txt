Rooms are clean and bed is super comfy. Just had dinner at the hotel bar and the Manhattan and hot beef sandwich are super good! My favorite part of the hotel was checking in with Angelo (I think that was his name) he was very nice and set us up in the perfect room. I would definitely stay here again.
