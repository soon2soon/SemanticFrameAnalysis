This place was amazing!! The staff was SO friendly and the room was beautiful! Very clean! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who loves a clean vintage look and feel and wants to be really comfortable! There is no breakfast but it's right down the street from gourmet doughnuts and small caf√©s. They offer complimentary coffee every morning which was delish. And a complimentary wine hour in the lobby every night at 5, awesome!
