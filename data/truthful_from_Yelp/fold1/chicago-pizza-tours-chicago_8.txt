Absolute must do for everyone. If your a visitor to Chicago there is no better way to get an interesting tour of the city and get initiated in the origins of Chicago Pizza. I assure you, you will not be able to eat all the pizza available to you on this tour. For vegetarians, they accommodated me at each location, all the pizza was very different Â and yet all were very good. Would do this again. I might do it tomorrow.
