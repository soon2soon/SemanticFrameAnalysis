For out of towners looking for a unique Chicago experience or city dwellers looking for a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon/evening, look no further-Chicago Beer Experience is it! We started at Harrigan's in Lincoln Park where we met our AMAZING tour guide Ariana and checked in.  Once everyone on the tour arrived the beer pouring commenced.  The owner of Harrigan's, a great guy from Dublin, poured our beers and told us about the perfect Guinness pouring technique while Ariana gave us some great Chicago history.  After 4 tastes here we head over to Paddy Long's for beer and bacon pairings-yes, you heard me-beer and bacon-hello HEAVEN! After more great beers and history we headed to Bodega Ramos, a cute little wine shop with tons of great craft beers as well.  Ariana gave us a brief run down of the brewing process and we got to smell different types of barley and hops while we tasted our 4 beers at this stop.  Next we headed to Delilah's for more amazing beers and the discovery of what may be my new favorite bar in the city.  They have THE best whiskey selection in the city as well as tons of craft beers on tap.  At this point the group was getting pretty rowdy and everyone was having a great time.  Ariana (did I mention she was amazing!) gave us some more great tidbits about Chicago beer history and then we parted ways to continue our nights.  I cannot recommend this tour enough, they also let us know that they will be starting a new tour soon and we cannot wait!
