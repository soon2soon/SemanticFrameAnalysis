while I like right by here and walk by it frequently, it wasn't until I got the Groupon for the Segway tour (pricey without a deal) that I finally came in for their services.  Very timely start at 7am for the Lakefront tour, our guide was fresh, fun, and animated as she took us through the training and led the way around the lakefront.   Good time to do this in the morning as it can get crowded later in the day.  You can't go as fast as you would like on these things but it is quite easy to learn and fun once you get the hang of it.  The major downfall of these devices is that you don't move your legs at all: after a couple hours you get achy from NOT exercising, so this is by far not a physical activity.  However it frees your coordinations senses up to experience a kind of gliding that is not provided by any other device and feels exhilarating.   I will recommend my friends here for tours and bike rentals, very convenience location.
