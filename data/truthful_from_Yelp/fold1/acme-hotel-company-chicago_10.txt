Awesome. Came for a visit from NY and researched almost every hotel on the Magnificent Mile. This place had good reviews and was super affordable. Got here and was pleasantly surprised. Cool vibe! They paid attention to the aesthetic details. I have no complaints. Will probably stay here again if I ever come back to Chicago. Friendly concierge also.
