I have been thoroughly impressed with the service that I have received here this far. The people behind the desk are great and when I upgraded rooms they kindly brought my luggage up for me. Granted the rooms aren't huge but they have what you need and do their best to make things easy for you... Free water, iPads for loaning, free wifi! Only downside is the walls are a little thin if you have rowdy neighbors.
