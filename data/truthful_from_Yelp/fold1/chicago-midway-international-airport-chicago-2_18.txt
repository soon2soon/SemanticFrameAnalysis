MDW is smaller than ORD. It is international yet not overcrowded, and you're less likely to pick up weird scents from passersby. It's easier for me to navigate and gtfo here than at ORD. Also, there's less traffic! I do not recommend getting here by public transit because of the neighborhood but if you must, take the orange line. TSA here isn't a painful process, and there are never lines. These people know you aren't going to take everyone hostage with your toenail clippers. You do not need to take off your shoes. But if the detector does go off, it probably is your shoes. They may hand-swipe you, and they get asked about it all the time. Be wary of the taxi drivers. Some rely on GPS and routine (no knowledge of the area save for downtown), meaning if you have to go local, he might've already ended up on the freeway. I was seeing someone special so I wasn't stingy but beware!!
