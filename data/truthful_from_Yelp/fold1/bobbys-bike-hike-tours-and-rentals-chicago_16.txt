I don't write a whole lot of reviews but I had so much fun on our Bites, Bikes, and Brews tour that I just have to give them the 5 star review they deserve. My group of friends and I got lucky since we were the only ones that booked that tour on a Sunday and Mike, the best tour guide ever, customized our trip for us and even took a detour to take us to a spot where Dark Knight was filmed. We got to check off a lot of "things to see and eat" off our list during the tour. The food is soo good and and soo filling...a whole slice of Chicago pizza and a whole Chicago hot dog and yummy cupcakes. I swear this tour was designed just for me. The girls and I aren't beer drinkers but the boys enjoyed tasting hearty samples of Chicago brewed beers (including the girls' samples). I think this tour is definitely worth the price! And I don't ride bikes much, but we rode a total of 15 miles and it surprisingly wasn't hard with all the stops we had and no hills to deal with. The streets weren't very busy on a Sunday afternoon. I must say there was one car who happened to fall behind our group on a non busy narrow street who decided to follow us for about 5 blocks honking non-stop. Why he didn't take a detour and turn on another street to pass us up, I have no idea. But Mike definitely handled the situation well and was as patient and nice as could be to this awfully rude man. Such a great tour guide. Loved it and definitely recommend!
