I was a bit anxious before going because the reviews were mixed. However, this was the most perfect hotel for my Chicago visit. It is within walking distance to Millenium Park and the major subway lines-including two blocks from the train that takes you directly to Midway airport. The concierge was fantastic at all hours of the day and night. The bar attached to the hotel is nice and has a friendly neighborhood vibe that many hotels lack. The room we stayed in was cozy but not too small-exactly what you could expect from a downtown hotel. We didn't hear noise from the rooms next to us and so it was quiet and private. There is a filtered water fountain that comes with free empty water bottles you can fill at your convenience--a huge perk for me!
