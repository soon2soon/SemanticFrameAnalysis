I just discovered my passport was expired and my trip is in 2 weeks! I was told you needed an appointment and when I called,the next appointment was not until the 5th of August. Someone told me they accepted walk ins, so i tried. Waited an hour tops and it was so smooth and easy. Was going to consider an agency such as Fastport, but not needed here. I am picking up my passport in 2 days and for half the price!
