This was my first time staying at a hostel. Didn't know what all to expect when I got there. I just had wild stories I heard from friends to go on. Needless to say most of them were false. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Plenty to do in common areas. The kitchen was huge and perfect for all manors of cooking. Only downsides I noticed was that they tend to keep the place way to hot, or at least for my liking.
