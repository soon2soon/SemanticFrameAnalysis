We participated in their Gold Coast / Old Town food tour as soon as we arrived and enjoyed every moment. All of the selected stops were some of the very best Chicago. Â Great way to taste your way through the "not as touristy parts of Chicago." Rachel and Kent were very personable and informative tour guides. Highly recommended!
