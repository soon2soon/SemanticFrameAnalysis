Romance personified.  If you are shopping, dining, or celebrating in downtown Chicago this holiday season considering stopping by the carriage stands on Michigan Ave for a tour of the loop - see stores like Macy's and the city Christmas Tree decked out in their finest holiday sparkle. If you call them directly they even take reservations for private transportation off their normal tour routes in covered or open carriages.  This is a year round service, but a special delight during the holidays.
