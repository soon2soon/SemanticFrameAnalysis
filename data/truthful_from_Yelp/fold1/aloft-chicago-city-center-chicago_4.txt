I almost wish Starwood was my primary hotel as I would stay here every time I was in Chicago.  The location is great with plenty around and many food options. The staff was very friendly and had my checked in no time.  I was on the 10th floor and had a pretty good view of the city.  The weight room was well appointed and had everything needed.   The room was fresh, modern and very clean.  I love the shower and that its not a typical boring hotel shower.  The restaurant downstairs put on a good breakfast and had several local beers to choose from.   No complaints here, a great hotel in the city.
