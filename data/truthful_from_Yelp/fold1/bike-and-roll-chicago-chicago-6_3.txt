I had one of the Best Days I have had in years! First of all this was a gift for Fathers Day from my two adult daughters. I love riding my bike on Chicagos lakefront and downtown early Sunday AM's. But Hyde Park is an area, I really have not spent much time exploring. All that has changed, because of Vincent who was our tour guide. It was a perfect Sunday afternoon with our little group. I will from now on become a big advocate on telling everyone I know that enjoys Biking and touring and just info on the city,about Vincent and bike tour. His passion and honesty about the area was just so refreshing. The time flew by and did not want it to end. The food was just awesome too on the BBQ tour too! Vincent Rocks!!!!! Beenzie
