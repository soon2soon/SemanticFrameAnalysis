This was absolutely excellent, I would recommend it to anyone, Chicagoan and visitor alike. There are plenty of different architecture tours along the Chicago River but Chicago Line Cruises really caters to their passengers with coffee, tea, lemonade, and cookies. Our tour guide was so knowledgeable, drawing on her decades of living in the city for stories, history, and gossip behind the city's best architectural landmarks. There are some great photo opportunities and passing right below the Willis Tower is thrilling. I would do it again.
