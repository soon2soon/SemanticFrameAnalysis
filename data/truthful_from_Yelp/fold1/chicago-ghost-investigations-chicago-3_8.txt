What a great experience. I knew going into it that it was going to be cool, but I had no idea how amazing it would be! CGI does a great job of teaching the groups about what they're going to be doing and why they're going to be doing it, they take great care to explain the equipment and the correct way to use it. My group didn't have very much interaction with the spirits associated with the building, but we did have almost nonstop interactions with a BYOG (bring your own ghost) who came with one of the group members. At the end, I was flabbergasted when my father came through to me, and I was able to talk to him and confirm that he watches out for me. He even hugged me. This tour is not for the faint of heart, but for those like me who are interested in the paranormal, this is an AMAZING experience.
