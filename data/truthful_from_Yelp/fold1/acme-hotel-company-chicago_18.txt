Had a "Girl Friends" getaway at Acme 1/12 - 1/15.   That room was awesome.  The bed so comfy we didn't want to get out of it.  Clean - immaculate is a better word.   Within walking distance to Michigan Avenue.  Museums very close and the front desk personnel (Jada!  Concierge Captain Carl!) were so helpful as far as instructing us on how to use the public transportation among other things. The "Morning Joe" was so much appreciated.   Berkshire Room.  Okay.  Meh. West Town Bakery - wonderful.  The sandwiches are HUGE, enough for 2  people to split so if you might think they're expensive, think again.  Very reasonable for the amount of food.  Baked goods are excellent. Will be back in the summer.
