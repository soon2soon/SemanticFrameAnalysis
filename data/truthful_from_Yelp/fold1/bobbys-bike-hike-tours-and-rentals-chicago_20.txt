My husband and I spent the week in Chicago,  Bobby's Bike Rentals was recommended by our concierge at the Drake Hotel.  We rented the bikes for a half day and toured along the North Shore and then dipped into the city near Lincoln Park.  Beautiful ride and great way to see the city! We loved it so much we rented the bikes 2 days later for another afternoon, this time touring the South Shore waterfront, even with the winds on our way back ( feeling like we were on a stationary bike at times : / ) we still had a blast! My only request to the shop is a larger front pouch or basket for personal belongings. Loved it! Shaun and Martine
