I was absolutely 100% happy with my experience here.  The shuttle was easy to find, everyone I encountered here was more than happy to help me with my 3284937 bags.  Upon arrival at the front desk, I decided to use one of the self check-in machines and an employee approached me to ask if I needed help (my 21 month old was screaming his head off).  I just asked him what the largest full size car he had was.  He offered me an upgrade to an SUV, which was awesome.  Well, before I knew it, he offered me a minivan instead and off I drove with a Grand Caravan for our 11 day midwest vacation.  Awesome!  I got a great rate from Costco and didn't pay a dime extra for my double upgrade.  DEFINITELY will use these guys again.  Thanks!!!
