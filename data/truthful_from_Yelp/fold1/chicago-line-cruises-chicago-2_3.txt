I'm not usually one to do organized tours.  But on the advice of a friend and considering it was 60 degrees today (in November!) I couldn't think of a better way to spend two hours of my quick three day trip here.  It is pricey (the only deal I could find was for two tickets and I was going solo) but after the trip I seriously thought it was worth every penny. Judith, our tour guide, was fabulous.  She talked the entire time.  And was a fast talker.  And REALLY knew her stuff.  All of the CLC staff are super nice (the tour I wanted was sold out but I ended getting a spot last minute...so ask to be put on the waiting list).  There was a seat left but on the advice of the guide I ended up standing along the rail for the whole trip and was glad I didn't end up taking the seat. As others have mentioned, opportunities for amazing pictures abound so bring a good camera if you have one (although I got some great ones on my phone).  And bring an extra layer - while it started off at 60 it was quite cold by the time we returned. Chicago, you continue to impress me.
