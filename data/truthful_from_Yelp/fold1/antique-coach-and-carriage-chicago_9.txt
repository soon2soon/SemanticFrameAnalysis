This was a great time!  You cannot be mad that the groupon expired on you!  How can you say that is bad service if you did not call ahead and do your planning.  They only have so many carriages and so many horses and hours to operate.  I spoke Debbie --- She is great!  I am bothered that someone even things otherwise.  She explained that everyone called the last 4 days of the Groupon and she only has so much man power and everyone was being rude to her :( Any ways - BEST TIME!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
