The manager at this location today did a great job. We were just standing there in dismay at an extra charge on our drop off. He noticed our expressions, approached and asked if there was something wrong. Despite the fact that technically the charge was accurate, he told us to give him 5 minutes and he'd take care of it. He was as good as his word. Talk about someone who truly understands customer service. We'll definitely remain loyal customers.
