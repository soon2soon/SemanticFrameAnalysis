I stayed here with my parents before I moved to Chicago and I was in love with the place. I got lucky and booked the room for a bit more than 110/night, which I thought was such a good deal. The staffs were super friendly. The room was clean and nicely decorated. It's very modern, and everything looked brand new. I wasn't crazy about the bright orange color - it hurt my eyes. but I dealt with it. Location was perfect - they were close to everything, and not right on busy Michigan avenue. They also have the friendliest door men who were always trying to help out. I'd definitely recommend the hotel to anyone.
