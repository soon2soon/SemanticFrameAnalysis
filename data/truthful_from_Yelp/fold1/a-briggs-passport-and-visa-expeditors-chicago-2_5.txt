I been using these guys for the past few years.   They have gone above and beyond what is expected of them.  There is a terrific level of professionalism and service.   I use them quiet a bit as each year, I need to renew my Chinese Visa.    In addition, I have had one lost passport and one damaged passport.   Because of my busy schedule, i find it is much easier to communicate with them via telephone and through federal express. The person I communicate with there is TIm Cantwell.   He is very helpful.   On my most recent interaction, I was coming home for a few days from one trip, heading on another trip and needed my passport and visa sent to me out of state, so I can then leave from China directly from there.   I was very nervous as there was only a day or two window of opportunity to coordinate everything.   The passport and visa arrived at the desired time.   Getting a chinese visa involves, filling out a proper application, buying two passport photos, getting invitations and a few other critical pieces of information.  Tim checks over the items and makes sure everything is good to go.  If literally, one thing is out of place, something isn't capitalized, if your birthdate isn't listed on the invitation, the whole thing gets rejected.  So, it's important there is someone like Tim who double checks everything for you. These guys are not the most important people in my life but, they do what they say, they make it a painless process.   You don't even have to think about it, if you want a passport place, just use these guys.
