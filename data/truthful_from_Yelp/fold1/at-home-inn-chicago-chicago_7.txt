We have used At Home Inn Chicago for the past two years to house out of town performers for the Windy City Burlesque Fest and highly recommend their service and properties.  The apartments we have used are well maintained and clean with modern furniture and great amenities.  Our performers love staying at the apartments and find them to be a relaxing home away from home.  We will definitely continue to use At Home Inn Chicago in the years to come.
