My experience with Alamo was very much like Jeff S.  Great deal on Hotwire, the shuttle was waiting right when I walked out of the airport.  The pick up was fast and easy.  This is what sealed the 5 stars though:  I got my car right in the middle of a major snow storm.  The agent told me to exit the building and go out along the back wall to pick my car.  When I exited the building,  another agent was there with my car, all warmed up and ready to go.  :)
