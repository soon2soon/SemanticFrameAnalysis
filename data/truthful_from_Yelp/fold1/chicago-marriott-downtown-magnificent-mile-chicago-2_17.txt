Stayed here a few years ago in August for my 21st birthday weekend bonanza! Thought I reviewed this hotel, but apparently not. Here goes! I loved everything about this hotel! It's in a great location, with great views all around! It's a busy hotel though, so something to keep in mind. The lobby is very large with a bar right when you walk in; very hip and helps create the atmosphere. The receptionist was very helpful, even provided free drink tickets for some clubs we were planning on hitting up that weekend. Very helpful staff and always friendly. It was much appreciated. The room was a decent size for having two queen beds. The view was gorgeous, but hey that's Chicago for you! No complaints about the room whatsoever, it was beautiful and perfect for four people to share. I would definitely enjoy returning to this hotel!
