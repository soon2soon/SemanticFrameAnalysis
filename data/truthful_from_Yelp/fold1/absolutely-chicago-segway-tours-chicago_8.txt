My husband and I had the best time on our Segway Tour when we were in Chicago in the end of May 2014! The concierge at The James Hotel recommended this company above numerous others. The staff was super friendly and our guide was awesome. I wish I could remember his name! He gave us a good amount of information at all of the stops but not enough to bore us. I left there feeling like I really learned a lot about Chicago. He even took pics and videos of my husband and I along the way. We laughed and smiled the entire time. This is a must do when you visit Chicago, if you don't you're missing out. Thanks for a great time Absolutely Chicago!
