I went on the Historic Chicago/Prohibition Bar Crawl with Elizabeth and it was great! I'm a new resident, and with having visitors come to town pretty often it is a bit of a struggle to do new activities without getting bored of them. I decided to take a friend on this tour, since we both are interested in history and it was a great experience. Elizabeth showed us the inside and outside of several buildings and bars which I wouldn't have normally taken time to look at. The stops were great, our drinks were already waiting for us as she would call in orders as we walked around. Highly recommend this tour and am looking forward to taking more!
