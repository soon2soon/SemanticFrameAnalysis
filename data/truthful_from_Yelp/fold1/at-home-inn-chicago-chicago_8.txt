We had over 20 people in town for a week, for our wedding. At Home Inn was a downright miracle. We found the OT11 house in old town, which has 4 separate apartments, and fit our whole group perfectly. For that same price, I think the best hotel we could have gotten would be a motel somewhere random in the far north side, or out by Ohare. The house is gorgeous and very newly renovated, from the looks of it. It also saves a lot of money to be able to all get together for breakfast or drinks in one of the apartments rather than going out. One tip --- the apartments don't have a lot of the typical small household things you might need day to day, like scissors or baggies or a notepad, so you might want to bring a few little things. However all the dishes, glasses, & linens that you need are already there!
