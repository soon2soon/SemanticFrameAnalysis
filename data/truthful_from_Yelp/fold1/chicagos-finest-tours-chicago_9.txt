I highly recommend this tour company. We recently took the pedway brunch tour and found it fascinating despite having lived in Chicago for 7 years. The guide, Dan, was amazing. He is a great speaker with a wealth of information about Chicago and history in general. The brunch was also great value and delicious. We have bought tickets to the 20's pub crawl tour and can't wait to go. Will definitely recommend to family and friends coming to town.
