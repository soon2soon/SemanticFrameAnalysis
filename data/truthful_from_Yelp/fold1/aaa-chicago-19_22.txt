I want to thank Â AAA-Chicago Automotive Group twice for doing an ABOVE & BEYOND and also provided EXCELLENT service in coming to my rescue, towing my car in a respectful manner, and showing up in a brand new state-of-the-art tow truck. I was stranded on I-94E heading towards the city. My alternator went bad and my car started to die. I called AAA and told me that Chicago Automotive will come to tow my vehicle (up to 100 miles-Gold Plus). It was on a Saturday night when it happen. I had a feeling it was going to take an hour or so for them to come because I assume they are busy with other clients. I didn't mind waiting. The weather was nice. Then, this morning when I called AAA, Chicago Automotive again was assigned to do the towing. I had them tow my car to my repair shop 11 miles away. Again, excellent service. Tom handled my car in a respectable manner. He was very careful in loading and unloading my car. I asked him questions about their line of work and the company he works for when he gave me and my car a ride to the repair shop in Winnetka. He says they are a 24/7, 365 days a year operation. He says all their tow trucks are 2-years of age and will add 6 new trucks to their fleet. So if you have AAA and need towing in the Chicagoland area, request Chicago Automotive to do the towing. You paid for it with your membership.? Why not get the best with your membership. They are the top echelon of automotive towing that I have experienced.
