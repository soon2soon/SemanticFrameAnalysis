My (now hubby) and I were married on the Valara VI on July 19th of this year (2014) and the day was perfect. The entire process of working with Mary in setting a date through to the wedding has been some of the best service we have ever come across. Mary was on top of her communication from beginning to end and attentive to all of the details. I did not have to stress during the day as her and the entire staff were amazing and took care of every single person aboard the boat. I didn't know how to put the day in to words without sounding like I was just a bride gushing about my own wedding so I wanted to share part of an email I received from a close friend after the wedding: "...(my wife) was going on and on about how great the wedding was with the view of the skyline & fireworks, the food, bar service, dancing, Obie, and the vibe in the air.  I think (her daughter) was feeling a little jealous and our friends with daughters getting married soon must have felt it too.  I kind of sensed a feeling of, "oh great, now how is our kid's wedding going to measure up to that..." We were in no way trying to "out do" anyone and in fact, were trying to have an amazing day without breaking the bank...and that's exactly what we did. Also, without any stress (it really helps that where you would normally have to get multiple vendors you have it all on the boat). We didn't plan to get married on a boat and I couldn't tell you how I came across the Valara VI to begin with, but if you are reading this review, it is sincere and I wholeheartedly recommend this boat for any event.
