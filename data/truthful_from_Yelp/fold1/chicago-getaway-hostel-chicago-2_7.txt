I stayed here with three friends, we are in our early to mid twenties. We booked a private room: four beds and a private bathroom. I was the most skeptical of staying here and thought we should have stayed in a hotel. I am happy to admit I misjudged this place. The good: The room was fairly spacious, and very clean. The bed was more comfortable than I was expecting. Air conditioning was nice and cold which was great. Shower was large, had good pressure and was nice and hot. The bad: The room only came with one desk chair, one or two more would have been nice. The toilet seat refused to stay up, which was surprisingly annoying. The lobby and common areas of the hostel are very nice. There are couches, and chairs for people to read or use laptops on. Public computers if you do not have your own, and Wi-fi that worked surprisingly well. There is a really nice patio/outdoor area with plenty of seating and a grill. The common kitchen was very large, clean, had plenty of seating, and vending machines for food, snacks and coffee. They do free breakfast every morning which was great. There is also a pool table, which was a nice ice-breaker for meeting other guests. We met several people from France and Australia during our stay. The Chicago Getaway Hostel is an excellent place to stay if you want to explore Chicago on a budget. You can't get more space, comfort or amenities for the same money. If you plan on spending most of your time and money actually enjoying all that the great city of Chicago has to offer; I highly recommend you stay here. You won't regret it.
