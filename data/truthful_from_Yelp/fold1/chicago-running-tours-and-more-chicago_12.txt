I made the discovery ofthe "running tour" on TripAdvisor and scheduled a tour during a recent visit to Chicago. I was cautiously optimisitc about a seemingly precarious combination of running and recieving a city tour. My friend and I were blown away at how impressive the tour was, and with our tour guide Marlin. We jogged at a comfortable enough pace to where we were able to absorb all the very interesting information Marlin had about the city in addition to capturing some of the best views of the Chicago skyline. We opted for the City in the Garden tour which showcases Chicago in such a refreshing way. I would highly recommend this tour to all of my friends.
