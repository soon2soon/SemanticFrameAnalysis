This Restaurant offers wine tasting, chocolate and cheese form around world. There is a fantastic selection of Cheeses, Wines and Chocolate to sample. A must visit for any connoisseur of the above. The staff are really friendly and welcoming making the entire experience very enjoyable. Try the Dutch Gouda, something that has more flavor than anything I can source locally.
