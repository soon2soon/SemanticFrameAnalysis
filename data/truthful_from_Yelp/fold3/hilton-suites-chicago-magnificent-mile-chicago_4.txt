I did not staying the hilton. My daughter and I only used the valet service while shopping at the water tower. I thought the service was easy and professional. While retrieving our vehicle my daughter left her American Girl doll bag with many accessories. That evening I called after we got home in michigan. They had not located it but took my information. About an hour later they had found it. They seems genuinely please to help. They made it very easy to ship it back to me. We will be staying here in the future.
