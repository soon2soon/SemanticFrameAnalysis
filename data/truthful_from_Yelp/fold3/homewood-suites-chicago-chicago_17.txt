I stay here often when I'm in Chicago for business. The location is great. I've always been impressed with the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. As others have mentioned, they offer a free breakfast daily and dinner on certain days. I can't speak for the dinner, but the breakfast is better than most complimentary hotel breakfasts. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
