I organized 12 woman to stay here for a bachelorette party, and we had a great experience! The reservation staff was super helpful and accommodating in helping me figure out what set of rooms made sense for our group. When I had to make changes, they accommodated it right away. All the front desk staff were super helpful to in getting us things like glasses, etc. that we could use for our celebration. My only word of caution is that the king suites were smaller than expected and a tight fit for four people, especially given the price.
