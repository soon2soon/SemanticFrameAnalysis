The pork tenderloin is the thing to get. It's incredibly tender (sous vide) and it is served in coins on a bed of creamy cannellini beans and stewed pork shank. The whole thing is like some meat orgy from heaven. For the adventurous, try the gnocchi small plate. It has fluffy truffle gnocchis sprinkled with smoked salmon roe (ikura), jamon, and bottarga. SO GOOD. Flavor city. Like an Italian take on sushi flavors. Also, treat yourself to a $20 pull of Pappy Van Winkle 15-year. Smooth, with a nice vanilla finish and a sweet tingle after.
