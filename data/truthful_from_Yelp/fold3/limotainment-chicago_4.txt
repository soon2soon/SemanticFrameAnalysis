We used Limotainment to shuttle our bridal party around on our wedding day this past Saturday. Everything went great. Used the large white limo bus from the pictures and it comfortably fit 21 people (including our photographers). Went from downtown to Lincoln Park, then stopped at a few locations for pictures on the way back downtown. We had a great time on the bus and Mike was helpful with any questions we had prior to the day of the wedding. Posting the thank you note I sent to them to save some time typing up a long review. Just wanted to say thank you to you, Limotainment, and our driver Ricardo for a great day on Saturday. The bus was awesome. Super spacious and comfortable for our whole wedding party throughout the day. Ricardo was amazing - he showed up early, got us to all of our locations right on schedule, stayed close so we could hop on and off as needed, and would check in to make sure we were alright as the day went on. We got to hit all of our photo locations and he was so good that we ended up arriving early to our final spot and had a chance to relax (and warm up) for a few minutes on the bus. Â  We would certainly recommend you guys for any event requiring transportation. The typical craziness of photos before the reception ran smoother than I could have imagined.
