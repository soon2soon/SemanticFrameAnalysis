We are never disappointed when we arrive at an Intercontinental Hotel.  The welcoming is always exemplary and they have always upgraded us complimentary.  We decided to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and went to open the mini fridge and had a little mishap.  Management rushed to our room to help immediately within minutes!  Once they discovered what had happened they took care of the problem and took care of us.  We are not ones to ever complain and they insisted on taking care of us.  Once again they never let us down with their amazing attentiveness.  We will definitely be staying here again!
