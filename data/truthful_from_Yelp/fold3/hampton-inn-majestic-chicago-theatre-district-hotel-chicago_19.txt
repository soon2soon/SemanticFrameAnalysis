While in Chicago recently we had the opportunity to stay at this very pleasant hotel. Tucked away above the Bank of America Theater, it isn't obvious to the average out-of-towner, but certainly met expectations and catered to all of our needs. Roomy for such tight quarters, neat, and remarkably quiet, the staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a great experience and would gladly recommend the to our friends visiting Chicago.
