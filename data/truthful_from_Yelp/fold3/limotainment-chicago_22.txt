I can't say enough about Limotainment and the company's owner, Mike. I got married in Sept. 2012, and we used Limotainment to pick up the wedding party at a downtown hotel, take us to three photo locations in the city, and then drop us off at the ceremony location in Lincoln Park. Everything went as smoothly as possible, beginning several months before the wedding when I first contacted the company. Mike answered all of my questions and responded quickly any time I had to call or email him. He checked in a few days before the wedding to confirm all the details. On the day of the wedding, the limo arrived at the hotel about 10-15 minutes early, but they didn't rush us at all when it took the last members of the wedding party a few extra minutes to get ready to go. They got us to the photo spots with no problem at all, despite heavy traffic in the city. We arrived at the ceremony venue a few minutes early, so we weren't rushed. Mike rode along on the limobus with us (another employee was driving), and he was a big help -- he kept an eye on the photographer's car during the photo shoots, helped people on and off the limobus, and generally made sure everything was going OK. He had the limobus stocked with beer and champagne for us, and they let us bring our own beer on, too. The limobus was clean and modern, and the sound system was great. About 15 minutes after we were all dropped off at the wedding venue, one of the bridesmaids realized she had left her cell phone on the limobus. I called Mike, and they immediately turned around and hand-delivered the phone to us at the wedding venue with no complaints. Everything about the company was extremely professional. Mike will be my first call if/when I need a limobus for any reason in the future.
