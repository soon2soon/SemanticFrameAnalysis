Planned a last minute trip to Chicago around Valentine's day so everything in the city that was a realistic price was booked. We basically picked this b&b because it was a steal and there was free parking. Love everything about it, reconsidering ever booking a hotel again after this stay. Staff was super friendly and location was great. Also right next to the highway so you can get anywhere in a flash!
