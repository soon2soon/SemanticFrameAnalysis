Loved, loved, LOVED this place! Incredible value and location (1 block from subway), excellent staff.  Certainly not the most luxurious of the downtown hotels, but you get free breakfast and basically free dinner with beer/wine (also free!) Mon-Thurs.  Super comfy bed, FULL kitchen, even the water pressure in the shower was great.  Highly recommend it!
