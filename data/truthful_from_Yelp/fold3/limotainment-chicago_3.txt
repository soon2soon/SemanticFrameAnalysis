I've taken Limotainment on a few occasions now.  The first was a concert with friends at Allstate Arena.  We were only able to rent out half of one of the luxury party buses.  Mike (the owner) helped us out - and we combined with another small group that was going to the same concert.  It was an amazing time.  Everything went smoothly, even with two groups. The next time we went to a concert in the suburbs somewhere.  This time we had a large enough group - and I organized.  I spoke with Mike directly and again it was a great experience from beginning to end. Most recently, I recommended Limotainment to a buddy who was having a bachelor party in the city.  They needed a party bus to organize transportation for 20 people from 2pm till 10pm.  The best man took care of the details...but once again - no matter who was doing the organizing, the same experience with this company has always been the same. I recently moved to San Francisco - but I'll be back for a few bachelor parties and weddings in Chicago this summer.  I'm not sure if we'll need a limobus - but if we do, it'll definitely be Limotainment.
