Honestly?! What's not to love about this place? My boyfriend and I visited today for the first time, Wednesday around 11:30AM. We were greeted by the hostess with a warm smile and seated right away, Erin was our server. She was awesome, attentive and told us specials of the day. My boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary and I had a tasty mimosa as well as coffee. Chicken & Waffles as well as the duck hash AND bacon were all served rather quickly which was also impressive! Everything was phenomenal, the drive from Naperville was well worth it!! We'll definitely be back soon!
