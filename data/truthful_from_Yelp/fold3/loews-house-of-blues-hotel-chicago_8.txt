My boo and I stayed here last Memorial Day weekend and were extremely impressed with the great service.  The concierge was really helpful in finding us great vegetarian restaurants in Chicago.  The rooms were cool and modern and clean. The bathroom we had was really spacious and location of the hotel couldn't be better.  The wine restaurant/bar downstairs is really good too!
