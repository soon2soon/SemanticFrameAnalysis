I have stayed at the Hotel Sax 4 times now and each time I love it. It's close proximity to everything you may need/want to do and the top not service is on point.  PLUS it's affordable.  My most recent trip was in March and it was my 1st trip since having my second child last August.  I was finally able to let my hair down and have a couple of drinks and needless to say I went a little harder than I probably should've.  I got so drunk I left my purse (with $600 cash) on my chair at the bar.  I also left my car in front of the hotel without getting my valet ticket.  I was lucky because not only did they park my car, I also went to the front desk and my purse was there with all of my belongings.  I know I was trippin' but the staff had my back.  (miraculously)  I can't say I would be so lucky again so I won't press my luck but one thing is for sure...they have earned my trust.  The door man remembered me and my fiance' from our stay 2 years ago too.  I couldn't believe it!  If you stay there you'll know him by his uncanny resemblance to Dr. Dre.  Stay at The SAX!!!
