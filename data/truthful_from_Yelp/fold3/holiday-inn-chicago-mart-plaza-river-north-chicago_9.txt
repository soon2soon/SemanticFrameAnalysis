We got our room through GroupOn, for a quick getaway, and needless to say, even at regular pricing we will be back. The guest are quiet and polite The employees here are welcoming and very helpful. If I could I would take a part time job here, just because the staff seems so open nice, almost like a family and we are long lost family members visiting for the first time in years. And let's not forget the view and food here are amazing! The gym is well equipped and the dry sauna makes me wanna come back, on that factor alone.
