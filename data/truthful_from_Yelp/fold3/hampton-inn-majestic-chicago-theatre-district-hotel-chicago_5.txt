Love this place. I almost always stay here or at the Palmer House (which is across the street). It's modern, it's by the red line (subway) and you get free breakfast and free internet. The rooms are quiet and fairly spacious. Although I've never parked here, the posted rates are some of the lowest in Chicago. What's not to love?
