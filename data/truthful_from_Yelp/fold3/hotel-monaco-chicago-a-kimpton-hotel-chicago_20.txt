This is our second stay at this specific Kimpton. We've also stayed at the Burnham in Chicago which is also fantastic . Why do we love Hotel Monaco? The staff (I'll say more about Antonio later), decor, location within the loop, and above all else, the window seating in the rooms. Or as my son used it...to sleep. This hotel is simply a delight. It has some costs that are a bit annoying and typical of Kimpton Hotels or any hotel within the loop (expensive WIFI, expensive parking) but I believe what makes up for it are things that matter to me: complimentary wine hour from 5-6p, yoga mats in room (yup, I like this), always fun animal print robes, high quality bedding, excellent room service and above all else...overall service. Antonio the door man offered exceptional customer service. When we arrived we were placed in a room with a window seat but the seat was much smaller than the room we previously had and did not contain a cushion. Just know...not all rooms have the large window seats with cushions. This we did not know and it was a big deal for us as my young son was really looking forward to the seat and eventually sleeping in it! Nonetheless we didn't decide to state anything to the front desk as we were only staying for one night but upon leaving the hotel for some sight seeing Antonio the doorman actually asked us if everything was to our liking. We decided to tell him we were disappointed with our window seat. He in turn stated how important it was for us to be completely satisfied so he quickly worked with the front desk to get us moved into a room with a larger window seat. Big kudos to him because it made my son super happy and I was beyond pleased. I think Antonio went above what is normally expected of a doorman and it had a great impact on how we view the hotel. Love this place. Book well in advance to get the best rates.
