What a wonderful suprise when we checked in. A room with an actual key!!! Love it! Amazing staff, helpful bellhops, and valets... I will make this my choice hotel for all our future Chicago visits. Price was less than others of comparable location, and the rooms have more of a B&B feel than that of a hotel... highly recommend.
