I am the Groom. We just had our  Blessed Wedding on the 24th of Sept. OOOO my. Maryann (catering Manager) was our first interaction with  the Hilton. She was joyous and energetic from the start! She and the Hilton staff made our reception most en joyous. If you book here ask for Danny (The Server) he is truly from the  heart! During the evening Scott Watrach was phenomenal and most attentive to my Pregnant Wife needs as well as myself. At nights end  Scott even  made sure we had everything we needed for the remainder of the evening (water, snacks etc..). Loinel the Valet was Also truly a gentleman upon our departure. Again I am the Groom and I work in hospitality and I am a nit picker. I felt at home.. Thee oooonly  issue I had was with the TVs Hilton had in the suite. Dam TVs showed dim so I was glad we had section 100 tickets for the thus far LACK LUSTER BEARs.
