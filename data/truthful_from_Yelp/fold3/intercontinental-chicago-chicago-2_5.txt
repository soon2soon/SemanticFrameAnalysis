My stay at this hotel was amazing! Everyone of the works was very friendly and were always willing to assist us. The room was beautiful with a king size bed and the bed and pillows were very comfortable unlike other hotels I have stayed at. The hotel has a Starbucks inside which is very convenient and also has Michael Jordan's steakhouse which is extremely nice. The location of this hotel is excellent as well, we walked pretty much everywhere on our trip and our hotel was never too far away from our destination.
