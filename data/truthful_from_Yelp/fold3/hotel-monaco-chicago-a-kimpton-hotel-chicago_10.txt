Location, location, location. Arriving from Boston for a holiday visit, we were able to walk a few blocks to the Monaco from the subway we took from the airport. Very convenient. We loved staying at Monaco! Aside from the fact that the hotel is so convenient to everything, it's a very comfortable place to stay. We loved our room! It was on the 14th floor and had an amazing view of the Marina Towers. We were visiting Chicago during this past Christmas season and enjoyed seeing the Christmas lights downtown, including the many lining the balconies of the Towers residences viewed outside our window. The service at Monaco was friendly and professional. Any request was answered promptly. Our room was elegant, eclectic and quite roomy. The window had a large daybed right against the window, affording a spectacular view. The bathroom was well appointed. Everything functioned well. The bed was comfortable too. They offered free newspapers and fresh coffee in the lobby in the mornings and also a free wine hour in the evenings. We also enjoyed a decent breakfast at the attached restaurant one morning. I rate this hotel highly because of its all around excellence. Nothing was shabby. Our rooms were cleaned promptly. The hotel staff were always welcoming. There are plenty of convenience stores just steps away from the hotel, as well as several worthy restaurants. You can also walk to Michigan Avenue and shop along the "Magnificent Mile" on your way to the John Hancock Tower (among other fun things to do). Like I said, location, location, location. This hotel is in the perfect spot and has everything else going for it too.
