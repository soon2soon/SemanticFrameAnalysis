This is so far the best hostel I have ever stayed. Friendly staff, located at the center of downtown Chicago with two subway stations (red and blue line to O'hare airport) just within walking distance. Grant Park and Millenium Park are just 5-6 minutes walk from the hostel. The room is clean and spacious, so as the restroom, I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend to others.
