We stayed at this hipster have in a somewhat newly gentrified area of Chicago and couldn't have been happier with our selection, and the restaurant; which we had brunch and a quick bite before dinner with drinks was awesome and offered a great experience. the rooms were awesome as well. Small, but so well done, we ended up remodeling our bathroom to replicate the feel.
