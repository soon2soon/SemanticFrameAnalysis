I did the Graceland Cemetery walking tour with Paula today.  A cemetery tour may sound creepy to some, but this tour was very rich with stories of Chicago history, as well as some beautiful art and architecture.  The cemetery dates back to the 1800s, and some very prominent people in Chicago's history can be found here.  Paula was very informative, animated, and obviously passionate about sharing her love of Chicago. Graceland is really a beautiful, well-kept cemetery, and it is impossible to cover everything in one afternoon.  But Paula provided some tips on where to find some additional information.  I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone interested in Chicago history.
