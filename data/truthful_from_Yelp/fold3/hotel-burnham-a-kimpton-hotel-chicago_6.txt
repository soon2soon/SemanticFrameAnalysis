Love this hotel. Have stayed here before when in Chicago as the business I am here for uses this hotel. This is a historical landmark Chicago style building. Old elevators with wrought iron are beautiful. They meet you outside when you arrive and have excellent customer service. Their front desk is almost always manned by 2 people and they are very attentive to you. Each evening there is a wine tasting in the lobby right outside the restaurant. They have a good restaurant with inside and outside eating when the weather is good. The hotel is right on an intersection of 2 main streets so you can walk anywhere from restaurants to Walgreens. The rooms are smaller than many hotel rooms but there is plenty of room and they are very nicely decorated and set up. 2 robes waiting for you in the closet when you arrive. Since my last visit here they now have bicycles available free for guests to use. They are limited so first come first served but what a great addition to offer as having a car in downtown is not smart and a bike is excellent. Definitely a breath of fresh air from done of the hotel chains. Great ambiance which is so nice for relaxing.
