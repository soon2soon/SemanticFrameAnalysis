Hillary is a natural teacher for adults. This walking tour truly takes you "inside" Chicago. She takes you down alleys to capture amazing perspectives on some cool buildings. Great mix of facts, stories, and personal tid bits. She takes you "inside" some cool old buildings too. I highly recommend taking this tour.
