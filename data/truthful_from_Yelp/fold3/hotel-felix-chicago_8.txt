The location is amazing!!! Check out the Underground Wonder Bar directly across the street for a mixed environment of young old, all races, live music as well as Chicago House music. Walking distance from sooooo many things. Now the rooms were great. Reminded me of the 4* hotels in Paris. It is a boutique hotel, the theme is upscale European. So if all you know of is Red Roof Inn, then you won't get it. The staff was great, it's gorgeous. I will for sure return. We loved out for our staycation away from the kids
