We live in the area and have used Janus for over a decade. I am so pleased to see that this business is still thriving especially now that travel arrangements are done online. Nothing beats having a travel agent really guide you through the process as it can get overwhelming. They are beyond accommodating and quick to reply to calls and e-mails. We even decided to switch hotels and it was done quick and easy, no problem. I highly recommend them!
