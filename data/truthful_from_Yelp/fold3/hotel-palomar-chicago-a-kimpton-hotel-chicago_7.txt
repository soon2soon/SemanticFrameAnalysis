Palomar is one of my favorite Chicago hotels, and I hope it keeps its identity following Intercontinental's takeover of Kimpton.  Besides the excellent accommodations, the concierge service is unrivaled, and there is a nightly wine happy hour.  The location is pretty terrific - walkable to a ton of great restaurants (most of which also deliver), and incredibly close to the red line. Sable - an excellent cocktail bar with great food - is right downstairs.  If you can get a reasonable deal, this is a great place to stay.
