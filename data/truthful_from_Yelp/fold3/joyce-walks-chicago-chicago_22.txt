We had a Groupon for a walking tour with Joyce.  We chose the Pilsen Murals tour and we had a great time!  Joyce clearly does her research and loves running the tours.  When we found out she used to be a teacher, it totally made sense.  She has a knack for explaining history and meaning, and pointing out things you wouldn't otherwise notice.  It's a great way to spend a weekend afternoon!  Looking forward to another walk in the future!
