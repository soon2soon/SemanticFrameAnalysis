I have used Janus for most of my cruises. I found that Mark and Irish were very accomidating in helping with all of my wife's and my travel adventures. We book a trip through a "big box" agency and, other than book the cruise were on NO help with travel or accomidations. On one cruise, I had left my camera on the plane traveling back from Italy. Mark and Irish went out of theit way to try to locate the camera with no help from the airline. After an extensive and exhausting search, including calling Europe, my camera was located and returned. I think Juanus went beyond the call of duty in assisting my recovery. I plan on using Janus for future trips and would recommend them to all.
