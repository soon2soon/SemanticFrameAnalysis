Aimee Moore was AMAZING!! Planing a destination wedding could not have been easier and stress free even though the hotel we decided on was very difficult to work with due to so many staffing changes. Aimee was incredible in ensuring that everything that was promised to us by our first events manager was what was delivered by the hotel. I cannot even tell you how frustrated everyone felt, but Aimee defused the situation, reached out to the proper people and I had nothing to worry about. She really cared about my wedding, she wanted to ensure that everything was going to be above and beyond my expectations. In addition to being so invested in my satisfaction she had negotiates incredible extras for us, including ocean front room, massage and great room rate for us an our party. Thank you Aimee (aimee@myislandgetaways.câ€¦), everything was simply amazing! Could not have done it without you. I would recommend Aimee to anyone having a destination event.
