Outstanding location - clean rooms and the HIExpress experience that I am used to. Rooms aren't huge, but you are in downtown Chicago...so go explore! The breakfast is free and full of options and you cannot go wrong with the valet parking. It was $49/day for unlimited in and out privileges. I will pay for convenience and this was worth it. You could stay out in the suburbs and maybe get a cheaper rate, but think of all the time you will save and more you can experience by staying here. You are getting a great experience in the hotel and the wifi is free (this seems to be a thing of the past anymore) Great place and full of historic charm. That doesn't mean run down - it means that it has been remodeled and taken care of. Very, very nice hotel. All expectations were met and exceeded.
