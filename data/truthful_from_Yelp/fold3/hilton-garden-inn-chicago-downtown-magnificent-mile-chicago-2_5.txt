This will be my new resting place in Chicago. Very clean, comfortable rooms.  Excellent housekeeping staff.  The Weber Grill is downstairs in the lobby.  If your an Honors member that is where you get your free breakfast.  Excellent breakfast buffet or cooked to order.  Great location and we had a room with a view.
