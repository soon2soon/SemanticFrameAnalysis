Living in Ypsi/Ann Arbor, MI, I find myself running off to Chicago pretty often - sometimes for research but usually just for fun. Anyway, I stay here every time I come to town and I've NEVER had a bad experience. In fact, I've never had anything less than a "this is really sweet!" experience. The staff is always really laid back and personable, and the facilities are always well maintained. Not to mention, its location in the heart of Wicker Park and just up the block from the Blue Line is extremely convenient - everything is accessible! I just stayed here last night and my room was absolutely amazing. The view from the Armitage is incredible. Brushing elbows with people from all over the world is another great perk. Until the day I actually move to Chicago after grad school, IHSP is the only place in the city that I'll stay.
