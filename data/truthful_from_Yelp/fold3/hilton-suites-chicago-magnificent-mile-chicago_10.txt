Right from the front door everybody is very friendly and helpful, especially the guys out front!  We have stayed here twice now and will come back again.  Excellent location to Hancock building and north Michigan ave area (water tower).  Great for families with the suite type layout.  Pool on the 29th floor is a huge hit with the kids and has an excellent view of Lake Michigan.
