This place is terrific. Even a small room is nice. Very neat and interesting decorations. The breakfast place is delectable. I had the egg white and spinach crepe, yogurt parfait, and their house crafted coffee. It was superb. The staff is very friendly but not annoying. It smells great there. Also- last summer a friend and I went to J Parker on the roof top. It was absolutely packed and literally got into a dispute over a seat- LOL. Awesome place.
