I can't say enough good things about Jorge at Insight Limo! He was the limo driver for both my bachelorette party and my wedding. At the bachelorette, he was on time, very personable and made sure the night went smoothly! For our wedding, he was again right on time to pick up the groom and groomsmen and take them to meet me and the bridesmaids for pictures in Lincoln Park. He was great when the weather was horrible. He let us borrow his golf umbrella to use during pictures since we only had small umbrellas. He helped me walk across the street and got us back to the venue in plenty of time. I highly recommend Insight Limousine and Jorge! You will not be disappointed!
