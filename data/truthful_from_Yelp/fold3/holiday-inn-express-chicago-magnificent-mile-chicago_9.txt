4.5 stars. Even though there are two other Holiday Inns in the area, I decided to book this slightly more expensive location and I'm so glad I did. The service and amenities were great! I booked this trip w the bf for a two day getaway. Got to hotel around 9am. Even though check-in was at 3pm, we were able to check in early and took advantage of the free breakfast. The had fresh fruit, oatmeal, omelet, sausage, milk and cereal, coffee and juice and Cinnabon rolls. Nothing like finishing your breakfast with Cinnabon rolls! The location was ideal, near magnificent mile and public transportation. There's also a great deep dish pizza place on the next block called Pizza Due. You're also right by a Starbucks, trader joes, and a Bloomingdales. The room is super small but the bed was very comfy. The only negative is that the walls are thin... We found out the first night when a few disorderly gentlemen who had too much to drink returned to their room screaming and then accidentally rammed into our door at 1am. Other than that, it was pretty quiet and I'm willing to let that slide. Definitely would return to this hotel if I'm back in the area.
