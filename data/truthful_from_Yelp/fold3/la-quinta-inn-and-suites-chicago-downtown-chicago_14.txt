We knew we had made the right choice with our hotel the moment we walked through the door.  We were warmly greeted at the front desk by David and another David was extremely helpful taking our luggage from the van to our room.  Both David's proved invaluable with their helpful recommendations regarding restaurants, transportation and sights to see.  The hotel was extremely clean and updated.  The breakfasts were delicious and plentiful - the girls serving them were a hoot!  Fantastic stay in a fantastic city!
