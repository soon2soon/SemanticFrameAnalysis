I've stayed at multiple hostels in Europe before and would probably say that holiday jones is one of the best I've ever stayed in! It was my first time in Chicago and wanted to stay in a trendy area with good places to eat and bars nearby. Wicker park is definitely the place to be. The staff, specific shout to JJ and Alfredo!!, were awesome. I already miss you guys and hope to be back soon. Both JJ and Alfredo were very attentive to my needs, providing extra blankets and towels when I needed them. I think a young woman needed a blow dryer too and she was given one to borrow! The hostel has a great decor, clean rooms and bathrooms, free wifi and free breakfast in the morning! I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone visiting Chicago. If you're alone, that's fantastic because you'll most likely meet others traveling alone if you just hang around the lobby area. If you are with a group of friends, you'll also love the stay! I'm a big foodie and loved staying here because there were so many places to eat nearby.
