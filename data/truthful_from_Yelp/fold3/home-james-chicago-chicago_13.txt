Excellent customer service ...  called a few days ahead to schedule a pick up and return to O'Hare for same day service and  received confirmation by email.  Very competitive rates and clean car.   Max, the driver was extremely professional, punctual and kind.  Home James exemplifies what great customer service should be!  Thanks Mounir and Max for making the day run as smoothly as possible!!  We will definitely use their services again and recommend them to anyone in the Chicago area.
