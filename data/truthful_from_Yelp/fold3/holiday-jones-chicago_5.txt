I've stayed in hostels all over the world and this was by far the best one I've ever stayed at. It was clean, trendy and in a fantastic neighborhood. The staff was friendly and helpful. Location is close to the metro and lively Wicker Park. Bathrooms were clean and private! What a treat. Overall, a great place to stay.
