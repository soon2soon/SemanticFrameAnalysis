We recently had a block of rooms here for our wedding.  They staff was really great to work with and bent over backwards to help us with anything (from bringing scissors to our room for last-minute wedding diy projects to upgrading my parents to a suite for their entire stay to even pouring a glass of champagne for the bride and groom after they started closing the bar).  They recently remodeled and the rooms are really nice and modern.  The suites were all more than spacious and the presidential suite was incredible.  The sales staff were all very kind and helpful, too, as we were setting everything up.
