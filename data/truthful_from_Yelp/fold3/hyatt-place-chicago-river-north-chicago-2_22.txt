I stayed here last weekend and was completely satisfied with everything. Customer service: impeccable. From the moment we checked in to the minute I walked out to catch my flight home. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. Kudos to the staff. Our room was on the top floor with a nice view of the city. It felt cozy, the bed was comfy, I liked that I could adjust the temp very easily: I'm always cold. Breakfast in the morning was a plus. I must have breakfast or I will become "hangry". Food was good and had warm/cold options. The OJ was super yummy and I was pleased to be able to take a to go cup for my tea. If I'm ever in chicago again I would stay here again.
