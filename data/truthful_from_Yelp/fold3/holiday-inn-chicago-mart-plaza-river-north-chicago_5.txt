stayed here overnight for Labor Day weekend and I have nothing but amazing things to say!! We scheduled it pretty late -- 2 weeks before our stay. with only 2 rooms left, we still managed to get a fabulous room! The staff was wonderful and went to the concierge before every meal and recommended great dining spots in river north. River north is directly behind the hotel and is a very wonderful and safe area. Since it is near the merchandise mart, there was a lot of trendy show rooms you could walk through. But, there are so many different restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The bar they have on the lobby floor has stunning views! A must do!! Best hotel I've ever stayed at so far, HIGHLY recommend.
