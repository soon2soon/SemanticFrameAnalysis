Great way to get out on the water and see the gorgeous Chicago skyline! Â We recently went on a 2-hour BYO cruise. We had some difficulty scheduling, so Justin offered to take us sailing on the one day of the week that he usually takes off. (So nice!) The boat was great, and Justin was fun and professional. Time and money well spent - highly recommend!
