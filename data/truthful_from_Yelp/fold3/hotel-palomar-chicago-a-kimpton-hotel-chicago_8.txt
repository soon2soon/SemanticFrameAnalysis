Headed over to the Windy City for a long weekend getaway and after reading an overwhelming amount of reviews on Trip Advisor, I had it narrowed down to a select 3- Hotel Palomar won out on price, location, and extras! We knew parking was not going to be cheap, but with the trains so readily available, why rent a car! We took the train from the airport and it dropped us off right at Â the corner of the hotel- couldn't get more convenient than that. I loved the area we were around, especially since Rick Bayless' restaurants are all conveniently located within a few blocks of the hotel, and other great dining spots as well. We walked everywhere and loved the walk by the river, especially at night. The rooms were spacious and clean and I did not have any problem with noise- and I blink at the sound of an ant moving! If you follow them on social media, they often have keywords that when you mention at check in, give you freebies. We were able to score a bottle of wine delivered to our room! On the topic of wine, their wine hour from 5-7 is wonderful as well. Several times we got back from all day outings, just in time to enjoy a nicely poured glass of red wine. As to service, the concierge Bobby was hands down one of the best I've dealt with. He was able to make several reservations for us with dining and the architectural tour, and despite having to change it a few times, was willingly and able to do it. He was generous with suggestions and overall, just a pleasant guy to talk with. Hotel Palomar definitely made our trip to the Windy City enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to coming back and staying here again!
