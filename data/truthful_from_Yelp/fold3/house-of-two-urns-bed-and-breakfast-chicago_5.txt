Truly lovely place, honey with all the amenities and comforts you could want.   The breakfasts are amazing and worth getting up early to make sure you don't miss them!   The hosts are okay but warm up quickly if that is what you are looking for.  I noticed that they seem to let the guest determine the level of interaction.  Considering how many international guests they have and do the great many cultures the hosts need to be able to accommodate, this makes sense.  However, their care is in everything they do, all the little touches that show incredible attention to detail and they care about their guests experience.
