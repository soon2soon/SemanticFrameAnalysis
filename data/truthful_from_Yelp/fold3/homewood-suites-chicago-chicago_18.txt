Sheila was working with me at first and was later promoted to a different position in the hotel. She was very responsive to my emails and prompt. She answered all of my questions within the half hour that I emailed her if it was a business day. The price quote that the hotel was able to give me was phenomenal considering this hotel was all suites. Also, there were no charges if my room block didn't get filled. They just cancel the rooms that didn't get blocked. Even though it's nothing fancy, I loved the fact that it was centrally located downtown, near public transit, and was a great money for the amount of space you get in the room. She set up my hotel block and everything is smooth for now. Alec took over for her and made sure he introduced himself to me. He was also able to answer all the questions I had. During the month of my wedding, Alec gave my guests a two week extension to book their rooms. All of my guests enjoyed their stay. I would recommend other brides to block their rooms at the Homewood Suites.
