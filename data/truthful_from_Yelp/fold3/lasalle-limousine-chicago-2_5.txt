I had to arrange a ride for me and my friend at the last moment, and I called a couple places and this turned out to be fabulous. I started by arranging my friend to be picked up at Skokie, pick me up in the city and be driven to the Hawks game. I talked to a really nice young lady named Monica to arrange all of this. It was a little difficult, because there were times involved and some last minute changes. I was somewhat frazzled, but Monica handled it professionally. I was worried that about everything working out and getting to the game on time. Well, I was so happy that everything ran smoothly that evening. My friend was picked up at the precise, predetermined time and so was I. All my worries were gone once we were being driven to the United Center. It was stressful and frustrating, but this company managed to make everything happen. They sure made my life easier that day. I think Monica was patient and kind, and it's nice to talk with someone who wants to help you. I will definitely use this service again, because I know they're reliable. Their rates were fare, which also made me go with them. First time using a car / limo service and I think I totally lucked out. It could of turned out to be a really bad night, but thank God LaSalle Limo Service made it so much more comfortable. I recommend this place to everybody and have no problem using them again. Not to mention, the driver was also very nice and helpful. The whole experience turned out great and I am so happy they helped in making it so.
