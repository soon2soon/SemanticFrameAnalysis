This review is for Level Two, the restaurant inside the Hyatt. Came here to enjoy the brunch buffet, where it's unlimited bloody mary drinks and mimosas. Obvi had to try both numerous times! Got a TravelZoo deal, which was totally worth it. I think it was something like $25 for 2 people. The buffet had some AMAZING dishes. It's been a couple weeks since I went, but a few that I can remember standing out: endless crispy bacon, seafood rice dish, benedict, and some great cold vegetable / salad dishes. Also tried a couple of the cutest little dessert dishes that came in these tiny cups. Perfect for a small tasting to end a very large brunch meal (not to mention all the alcoholic beverages consumed up until that point haha).
