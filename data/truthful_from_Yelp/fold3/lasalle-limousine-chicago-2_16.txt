I used LaSalle Limo for my mother and her best friend's 60th birthday celebration and they were the best!! Our driver was friendly and personable, he arrived on time, the car was clean and comfortable, and planning the event was easy to do with clear confirmation, fair prices and no last minute wierd charges. Brilliant, straight-forward service. I would use this company again without hesitation!
