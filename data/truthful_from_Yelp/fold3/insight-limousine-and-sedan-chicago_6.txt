We used Insight Limousine on February 5 a day after another major snow storm.  We were traveling to Midway Airport.  Blanca was our driver.  Not only did she arrive early, but she was wonderful.  I admit I am a nervous passenger... not so with Blanca.  Her driving was outstanding.   She was a true professional.   Jorge was our driver on our return from Midway.   Our flight was delayed... no worries Jorge was on top of things and probably knew before we did.  He was waiting for us as we arrived to Chicago.   This company made our travel so much easier.   I can't say enough great things about Insight.  We most definitely will use them again.
