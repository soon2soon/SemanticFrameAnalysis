My husband and I had reserved a room for 5 nights. Our flight was repeatedly delayed and subsequently canceled until the day after we had planned to check in, but the hotel desk clerk was incredibly understanding each time we called to update them even though it was about 3:00 in the morning. In fact, he said they would hold our reservation and not charge us for the first day. The hotel was clean, quiet, and cozy. We could walk to every local attraction we wanted to do (Second City, architectural boat tour, Navy Pier, great restaurants, pubs, and shopping). You can get to the hotel for $5 per person by train from the airport, even with big luggage. Buy a "Single Fare" ticket on the Blue Line Train heading toward Jackson Street (vending machine at airport sells the tickets, includes 2 transfers). Get off at the Jackson Street stop. Then take the elevator to the Red Line train and get off at Clark/Division stop. Walk two blocks to hotel. Whole trip took one hour. I will definitely stay here again if we make it back to Chicago.
