I love the service at Lasalle Limousine.  I have been using them for years.  I have used their services for birthday celebrations, nights on the town, NYE celebrations, concert events, trips to Bears games, and trips to and from the airport.  Basically, anytime I do not want to deal with traffic or I simply do not want to ask someone to pick me up or take me to the airport.  They have friendly telephone staff and responsible drivers.  They get me where I need to go on time and safely.  I have recommended Lasalle Limo to all of my friends and they love them too!   Lasalle Limo is great for special events and for a simple ride to the airport, with reasonable prices too!
