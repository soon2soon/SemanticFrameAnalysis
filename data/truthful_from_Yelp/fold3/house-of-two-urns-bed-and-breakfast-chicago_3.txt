I am happy to share my experience at the House of Two Urns. I am glad I made the decision to stay there while exploring Chicago! At first I thought it would be a little far from the downtown, sights, but it turned out to be very conveniently located, since there is a bus in the corner that can take you to the city centre and a subway 2 blocks from the B&B. I really felt at home at this place. They have got all the amenities: dryer, coffee machine, full equipped kitchen, slippers, good towels, soap, shampoo, a fridge to put your food, toiletries, iron, etc. I also love the decor with all the camera collection and the laid back environment. Exquisite breakfast too!!! Very customized, super yammi, better than Hotels in my opinion. The muffin, oh my god, and the waffle... I was really amazed. The girls were so helpful and kind. I was also impressed with the cleaness and tidiness of the place. I couldn't find a single hair on the shared bathroom floor. The only (-) was the bed. It was very noisy, old, the mattress was bad, very bad! I stayed in the smallest room, I think they call the standard/ cat room. Other than the bed I really like my room. It was tiny but cozy, I felt like it was mine. There was a closed to put all your belongings and you could lock it. I highly recommend this place!!! I have seen other rooms and there are all one of a kind. I stayed in this tiny room, but was super ok, and my friend stayed in a HUGE room, connected with another one, I guess more than 4 people could sleep there, there was a big tub in her bathroom as well.They have got 2 houses, one across the other. My friend stayed in the newer house and myself in the older. Breakfast is served in the older one. I think anyone would be just fine!
