Top notch organization.  I can't say enough good things about Liberty Travel.  Let me begin with Alison, my travel agent.  You see I had this dilemma, I needed to get to NYC before Spain for business.  As a self employed person, I usually handle such matters.  Not anymore.  I don't know what she did, but she saved me money, and got me better flight on the return trip.  I could go on but really you need to let these guys go to work for you.
