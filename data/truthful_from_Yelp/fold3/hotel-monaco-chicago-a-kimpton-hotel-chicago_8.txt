I've been pretty stingy with my 5 stars lately, but as I sat down to think about the 3 nights I spent at the Hotel Monaco recently and could not think of anything I would change. Was able to take the train in from O'Hare. $5 instead of $50 in a cab. Walk from the Clark/Lake station is several blocks, but no problem for me and my wife. Arrived around noon, but were able to check in to our river view king deluxe room. As Kimpton Kharma rewards members, were given a $10 voucher to 'raid the bar' either in the room or in the hotel restaurant. The prices in the room mini bar were actually quite reasonable even without the voucher. Also, free wi-fi with good speed for Kharma members. We had only booked for Thursday and Friday night but wanted to extend to Saturday. The front desk clerk who checked us in said she didn't have anything available at that moment, but to check back the next morning because people often cancel their reservations the day before. In the end, we not only were able to stay an extra night, we were able to keep our same room. (I was worried that there was going to be a hassle because we Â were charged a higher rate for the third night, but the desk clerk fixed this on checkout.) The room was large and comfortable. Wouldn't change anything there. We loved our view of "beauty and the beast" across the Chicago River -- the famous twin corn cob apartment buildings and the newer Trump International building. We actually used the window sitting area several times just to relax and people watch. The porters working out front were always very helpful and friendly. Love Chicago, and love this hotel. Can't wait to go back.
