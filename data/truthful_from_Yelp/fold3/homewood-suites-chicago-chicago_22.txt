We used this hotel for our out of town wedding guests and ourselves the night of our wedding.  Melah and the entire Homewood Suites team was amazing to work with and very attentive.  The rate includes breakfast which was a big hit with our family and friends.  It also provided another opportunity to see everyone the morning after the wedding.  Overall, a great value for the rate that they provided with the block of rooms and as a bride I couldn't be happier with the accommodations.  Even the bell hops were great!
