I am writing this review as a landmark not really for a stay here. This place is beautiful. It is very ornate and extravagant everywhere you look. I have seen the presendtial suite which is the coolest most over the top room i have ever seen at a hotel. The views are astounding and the room is larger than my apartment. This is a really nice place to just visit.
