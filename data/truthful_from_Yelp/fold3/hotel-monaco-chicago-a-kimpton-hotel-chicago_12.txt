I have stayed at the Monaco Chicago many times and every time it's been a great experience; good service, friendly staff, impeccable rooms, and awesome amenities. But the reason they are 5 stars for me is because of the way they care and go beyond for their customers. This week I was stuck in CHI because flights were cancelled and my company wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get out the next day or the day after. They booked a room for 2 nights and even though I wasn't sure if I was going to need the second night, the folks at the Monaco allowed me to keep my stuff in the room past checkout time. The Kimpton Group in general is a fantastic hotel chain but the folks at the Chicago Monaco - Erica, Dana, Gwen, and so many more - are the best!!
