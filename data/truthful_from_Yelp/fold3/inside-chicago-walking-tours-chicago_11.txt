A friend and I joined the Secrets of the Loop tour, and we very much enjoyed our experience.  Hillary has an amazing knowledge of the city, and she made the buildings and hidden spaces come alive with stories and interesting bits of information.   Her background in education was readily apparent, as she was able to present the information clearly and in an engaging fashion.  We didn't have much luck with the weather--at one point it poured buckets and nearly soaked us all--but Hillary maintained her great sense of humor and worked around it.  (Do be prepared with an umbrella if the forecast warrants it.  The tour goes on, rain or shine!  Also-- be prepared to walk briskly; Hillary has lots to show you and has plenty of energy.)   Despite the weather, we were glad we went, and we'd be glad to join another Inside Chicago Walking Tour in the future.
