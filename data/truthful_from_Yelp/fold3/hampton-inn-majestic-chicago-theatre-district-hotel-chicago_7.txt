My husband and I got lucky when we scored a couple of nights at the Majestic! We were en route from Washington DC to Las Vegas via O'Hare when something went wrong in the control tower and the airport was shut down for a few hours. This threw flight schedules into chaos and we missed our connection. We were told it would be two days before we could get a flight to Vegas so we were "stuck" in Chicago! Many other people were in the same predicament and every hotel around the airport was booked all the way into the downtown area. The Majestic was the only thing available. I do a lot of research when I choose a hotel so the idea of staying some place that I know absolutely nothing about is frightening. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. The Majestic is in the Theater District, three blocks from Michigan Avenue. It's within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, Anish Kapoor's "Cloud Gate" sculpture, and the incredible Art Institute. The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The people who worked the front desk on the 4th floor were very helpful with restaurant suggestions and ideas for things to do downtown. The free breakfast buffet at the Majestic was actually better that the $60 breakfast at our hotel in DC! So, we made the most of an unfortunate situation and sincerely enjoyed our time in Chicago. I hope to get back again for a longer visit and I'd absolutely stay at the Majestic again!
