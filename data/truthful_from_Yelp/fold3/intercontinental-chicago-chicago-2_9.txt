Stayed here for a couple of nights this month. The location is excellent! You are near everything: millennium park, magnificent mile, the river,etc. If you are a remember of the IHG rewards club, you get free wifi and late checkout! Make sure to checkout the beautiful, historic indoor pool. Wish I had time to just sit there for a while. Staff was friendly, room was clean, and everything was great. What a pleasant stay. Wish I could say the same about the weather. :(
