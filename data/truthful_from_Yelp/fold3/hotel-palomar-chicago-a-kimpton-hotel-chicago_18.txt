Outstanding best describes this hotel! I was getting married in Chicago and mentioned this in my reservation. The hotel staff noticed this comment and couldn't have been more gracious and thoughtful in acknowledging it. The staff: Amazing best describes each staff member I encountered. Everyone is pleasant and helpful. They truly seem to enjoy their jobs. A special kudos to Brandon at the front desk for all his hospitality! The hotel: the public areas are well kept and clean. Our room was spacious and very nicely furnished. The bathroom is luxurious. It had a deep soaking tub Â (which I actually used) and a huge glass enclosed shower w a wonderful rainfall shower head. The hotel is located in a great area surrounded by shops and nice restaurants. It is also a short walk to Michigan Avenue shops as well. Sable restaurant: a great place to dine. Good energy, fun servers, tasty food and a huge selection of unusual, hand crafted cocktails. My experience at the Hotel Palomar was outstanding! I will certainly return!
