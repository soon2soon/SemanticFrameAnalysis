My friend and I did the River North tour and we loved everything that Hilary showed us! This is not your traditional tour where the tour guide will just give you a laundry list of facts. This is an engaging, fun tour where you'll learn interesting tid bits about different kinds of buildings. Hilary is open to questions, very friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed ourselves and learned many fun facts about the city. I would highly recommend this tour (I'm sure the other tours advertised on the website are just as good) and I will certainly suggest doing this to my other out of town guests.
