beautifully decorated with a swanky, sexy vibe.  attentive service...i got the flu while staying there, and they brought me tea at no charge.  cool game room on one of the mid floors, which is great for that day on your trip that you just feel like staying in rather than going the tourist route. nice, if expensive, wine bar attached, and walking distance (hey, i'm a new yorker...anything's walkable!) to many destinations and mass transit.
