had the yelp deal Â - $30 for a ride to oharea (from my place it's usually $45) Making reservation: no problem. Took 2 minutes on the phone. I called the week before. Pickup: Was set for 1 PM, driver came at 12:59 exactly, no prob waiting 5 minutes for my late friend Car: was roomy, no probs Driver: tons of traffic on the highway so he took a back way to skip a few exits. Love it OVERALL: will be using them again!
