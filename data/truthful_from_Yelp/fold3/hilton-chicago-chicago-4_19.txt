The driveway entrance is on Balbo and when you enter the hotel from there, you're greeted with an immense room fill with lots of hustle and bustle. The grand ballroom, is indeed GRAND. The ceiling ornately display portraits and dozens of chandelier. When I'm here for a gala or ball, I like to go upstairs and just stare down at the crowd. The upstairs is a great place just to people-watch away from the crowd.
