They seem to have gotten more uppity in the past few years which I assume is from the increase in customers. I ordered a Sprite and the couple at the bar laughed. The bartender seemed unfazed. Great atmosphere. I always feel really comfortable at this place. It's tiny and intimate. They opened up the back area for larger crowds it seems so three should still be plenty of seating. Longman is a great winter bar. They have a great selection of whiskey. I'm not a drinker myself but I remember their mixed cocktails being pretty good. Longman is attached to a hotel as well, don't forget. It can provide the perfect staycation combo.
