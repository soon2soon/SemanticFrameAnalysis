3 bros, 3 chicks, a box of wine, beers, some vodka plus two hours on a sailboat made for a great evening. You can't go wrong with this adventure with Captain Justin at the helm. A great way to see the skyline, go for a quick swim, and then your back to the marina all too soon. Justin hung out with us for a beer once we were docked. Very cool guy and come to find out he's from northern Michigan, where I grew up, so he's that much cooler. You won't want the cruise to end, trust me. We did the 7-9pm time slot and it made for some great photos and the temp was perfect. Bring it: Pastic cups Camera Tip the Captain Avoid glass Swim Drink
