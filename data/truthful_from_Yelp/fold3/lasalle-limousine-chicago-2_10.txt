I've used Lasalle Limo twice now and have been very pleased with their professionalism and reliability. When you have early flights at ORD it's critical that the driver show up on time. Who else will you find at 4:30 a.m. if he doesn't show? Lasalle delivers on reliability. And the driver was very friendly, professional and chatty without being intrusive. The car was clean and the ride was smooth and safe even during a downpour. I would not hesitate to use them again.
