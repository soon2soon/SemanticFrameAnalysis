I've lived in logan square for 2 years and have been meaning to try this place out since I moved here! So glad that I did. We went on a Friday evening right before the dinner rush and were sat right away. We both had an old fashioned and omg was that delicious! Probably the best old fashioned we've ever had. We had the bone marrow appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. For dinner I had the fried chicken and it came with hush puppies fried in duck fat... Yes it's as delicious as it sounds! My boyfriend had the burger with fries. The fries were fried in beef fat and they were seriously delicious. I will definitely be coming back here! Great food, great drinks and great service!
