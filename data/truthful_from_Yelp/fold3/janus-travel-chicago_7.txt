The first time I used Janus Travel was booking a spring break trip to Cancun with 8 college friends back in 1985.  Back then, you really had no choice but to use a travel agency. Since then, although the travel industry has changed considerably over the years, and the use of an agency really is not necessary, I have continued using Janus.  (the past 10 years probably 2x a year).  I have also introduced numerous friends to Janus, and all love it. Although i can normally find what i am looking for on line, it is the personal touch Mark gives me each and every trip that keeps me coming back.  I am probably one of his biggest pain in the butt customers, but he is always eager to help.  He knows exactly what i am looking for, and most of time has traveled to either the resort or area i am interested in. I have been using these guys for over 25 years and have no intention of going elsewhere.   They are a diamond in the rough! Use them.....you won't be disappointed.
