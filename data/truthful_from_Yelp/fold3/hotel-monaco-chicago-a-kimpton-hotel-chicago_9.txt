Absolutely deserves the 5 stars! We usually stay at Kimpton when we travel because we are pleased with the consistency of high quality service and accommodations, not to mention it supports lgbtq equality so that's a huge plus for us. I want to say that the doorman, Antonio, was about the most friendly and helpful person I met while in the city. What a guy! All the other staff were great as well. Anything we asked for, from the kureg to different pillows, was taken care of immediately. We ate at South Water Kitchen on the first floor and was very happy with their food, and the bartender really knows her stuff!
