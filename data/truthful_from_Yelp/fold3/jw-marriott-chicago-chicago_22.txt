World class all the way!  The moment you step out of your vehicle you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel is beautiful! The rooms are super clean and nicely decorated. BEST part...it was VERY quiet and the beds ultra deluxe with a VERY comfortable pillow top mattress, luxurious, high quality linens (and I'm a sheet snob) that didn't reek of bleach, down pillows and down comforter. I have a difficult time sleeping on most hotel mattresses that seem more like slabs of concrete than a mattress but at JW Marriott it was sweet dreams and no need for taking pain medication upon waking. The bathroom was spacious with a very large walk in shower and HUGE soaking tub.  We will certainly stay there again when in Chicago.
