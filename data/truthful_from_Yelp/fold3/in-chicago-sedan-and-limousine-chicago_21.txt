Used this car service this morning to get us to O'hare. Our driver Jim picked us up just as we requested --- and when the traffic slowed due to construction, he knew exactly what alternate route to take without skipping a beat! Worth every penny to ride in luxury and arrive relaxed, happy and on time! My husband and I were both impressed by this company's professionalism and way the entire transaction was handled from start to finish! I only wish more companies did business this way. MANY thanks!
