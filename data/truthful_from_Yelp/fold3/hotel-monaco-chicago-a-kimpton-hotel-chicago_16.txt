My wife and I are Kimpton Group members and really enjoy their attention to detail. We stayed here at the Monaco for five days and had a river view. There was also a nook with pillows in the window to sit and enjoy the view and hustle & bustle below. The hotel and room was clean, bed was super comfy, and the staff was always ready to help with anything. The location is walking distance from the Magnificent Mile , shopping and food. Also the aquarium, and concert venues are close as well. We look forward to staying here again! And we plan on asking for the same room.
