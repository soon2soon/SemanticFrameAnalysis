If you need a great place to stay in the Chicago financial district, I suggest the La Quinta at 1 South Franklin. All the staff is helpful and friendly, but the assistant manager, David Lim, goes above and beyond to be accommodative to guests. The rooms are comfortable, breakfast is included in the reasonable cost. This will forever be my hotel of choice when I have business in town.
