What a great place to stay!! This hotel was right next to a business building- with Google! Cool! Upon entering, I was unsure if I was able to go to the room since it was before the check-in time. However, the check-in was quick and the front desk gave me the keys to my room. I got the room so close to the elevator on the 2nd floor which was nice. I also asked for a 2 queen room, which was also offered for free. He also gave me coins to use for drinks in their business lounge every night from 5-8pm with free appetizers. I'm loving it already. The rooms were really clean and the bathroom was spacious. On our 2nd day, we found some cookies at the front desk, and they were absolutely delicious! I love the h2o products that were in our rooms as well. The hotel is very close to the trains and many other tourist spots. I would definitely return!!
