Great place to stay when traveling. Not too far from Chicago. Rooms are a nice size and clean. There is free breakfast but it goes fast with the amount of guests that stay here. Staff was very helpful especially  the woman named GRACE. Excellent  hardly describes her service and attitude. Very helpful! They also have a bar off of the front desk...if you go, you have to have Grace make you a Manhattan because it's amazing!
