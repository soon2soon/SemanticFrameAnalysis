This was by far one of my best hotel experiences! It was my first time in Chicago and this hotel had the perfect location! It was very close to Chicago Theatre, Willis Tower, shopping, restaurants, Millenium Park and the train! I was able to walk everywhere! The hotel staff was phenomenal. Everyone was very nice. The room had amazing decor. I was so impressed the minute I walked in. Everything was so clean, comfortable bed and perfect temperature. The complimentary breakfast was the cherry on top for my stay. I woke up to delicious oatmeal, waffles, cereal, eggs and much more. I was so glad that I didn't have to worry about going anywhere for breakfast. They also have free wifi with great reception which was perfect because I had some homework to submit. My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for Valentine's Day and we couldn't have been any more pleased with the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel especially for any Chicago first timers!!
