I guess this is a Wyndham now. I stayed April 2013 post-remodel. It was posh without being obnoxious. I'm not a fancy pants and I didn't feel out of place. The location is fantastic. The rooms and views are beautiful. Get on the correct side with a view. It's across from the river that goes through town. You can take a $3 water taxi (boat) ride to lots of downtown places. You can also walk to a lot or take a short cab ride. Near the Magnificent Mile if you're into shopping. Near a lot of good restaurants a medium length walk away. The waterfront is pretty to walk. A 7-11 is near for whatever you forgot. I would never stay anywhere else again. I'm sure it's just as good under the new ownership.
