Such a deal!  Okay the old joke actually applies here - the rooms are so small, how small are they, they are so small you have to go outside to change your mind. But for the price and location, you can't beat it.  Staff is friendly, valet service promptly gets your car.  Some other reviewers have not been impressed by the breakfast - it's as good as any other free breakfast.  Plenty of yogurt, bagels, etc.  Why spend at least double for anything else comparable?
