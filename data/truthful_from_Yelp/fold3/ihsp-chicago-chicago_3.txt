IHSP is easily in my top 3 hostels I've ever experienced! Convenient and safe location in a contemporary and lively part of chicago. The hostel has a very social and friendly atmosphere, so youre guaranteed to make friends from various corners of the world. The roof deck with view of the skyline is a definite plus. I ended up touring the city with some of the travelers I met here, and made lasting friendships in turn. I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable as a single female traveler here. Privacy was well respected. The hostel also has really nice/clean facilities and amenities. as a backpacker Im always concerned about the possibility of bed bugs...no concern here whatsoever. they have you check all personal linens before entering to eliminate that possibility. laundry facilities and clean linens provided daily, breakfast provided, good coffee/tea (a rarity in hostels!) etc etc The whole staff at IHSP is very personable and knowledgeable about the city, directions/attractions, and just travel in general. But special shout out to Kevin(!) for going way out of his way to help me on numerous occasions! Made my experience in chicago that much more enjoyable. He managed to fit me in last minute when my travel plans were less than organized. All around, a seriously generous and hard working staff. thanks guys! much love from Hawai'i
