We had our wedding at the Hard Rock and it was amazing.  The space is beautiful as the hotel has maintained the historic feel of the building while incorporating the Hard Rock Hotel touch to make it still feel modern.  The space is perfect for those looking for a beautiful venue but don't want the traditional stuffy wedding vibe.  Also, the cocktail reception is held in a separate room from the reception and is one of the only balconies to sit above Michigan Ave. The event coordinator, Barbara Martin, and her team were phenomenal.  She has this coolness and calmness that puts all your wedding planning stresses at ease.  She brings years of wedding and event planning experience and we felt extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to use her at this wonderful hotel.  She is the reason everything went smoothly and seamlessly.  She knows exactly what she's doing and helps to remind you of when you should be thinking about / planning various aspects of the wedding.  She was ontop of it all. Also, if you're like us, you've had your share of mediocre food at hotel weddings.  I cannot express to you how fantastic the chef and kitchen staff were at our wedding.  I have no idea how you cook 150 steaks perfectly, but they managed to do it.  The chicken was also so tender, and not your traditional boring ass chicken with some oregano sprinkled on it.  I'm pretty sure our guests cared more about how great the food was than the actual wedding parts. If anyone is debating about having a wedding (or I guess any other large event) at the Hard Rock Hotel, I would say to at least just meet with Barbara...and let her use her soothing voice to get you to sign whatever she wants.
