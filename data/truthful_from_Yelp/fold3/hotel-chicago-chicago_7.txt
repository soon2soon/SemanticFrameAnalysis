The 2/3 times I've visited Chicago, I've stayed here. I love it. The 2nd time i returned the whole first floor/lobby was remodeled and is GORGEOUS. The staff is super friendly and helpful- especially the doormen who are always a pleasure to have small talk with. Location is perfect, right in the middle of downtown next to the river, tons of bars and restaurants a few steps away. The beds are so comfortable, rooms are clean, bathrooms are large, floor to cieling windows with amazing views. I could go on all day about this hotel, as much as I love trying new places to stay- I'll probably always return here.
