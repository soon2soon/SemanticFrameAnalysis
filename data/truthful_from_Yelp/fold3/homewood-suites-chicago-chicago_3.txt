This is the hotel of choice for my husband and me, for the past fifteen years. And assuming things go well, we'll continue to stay here. Now, to explain my five-star review:whether you like a hotel depends on whether it's got the amenities you like and use. We don't drive to Chicago, so we don't care what the parking fees are. We don't have kids, so we don't care about the extra beds (although there are sofa beds out in the living room.) Restaurants abound within a matter of blocks, so the fact there isn't one in THIS hotel matters little. BUT this hotel's got a breakfast every day in the lobby, and a full kitchen in every suite, so I can go down and eat my breakfast then bring something up for my husband, who sleeps in. We can bring snacks and appetizers and wine and cheese back to the hotel room. They have luggage hold. But most importantly, there is the staff. Individually and as a group, this is the gem in this hotel's and this chain's crown. We do come a few times a year, over a long period of time, but I would not call us 'frequent sleepers'...and yet we're greeted like long-lost friends every time, by name. (This was a comfort for me, on the occasions I traveled alone. Though safety is largely my issue, it's nice to know that the doormen/valets are downstairs watching everyone who comes and goes.) The disclaimer is Â the hotel's changed hands recently--in February, I think, so it yet remains to be seen whether the current management maintains the stellar staff performance. And yes: the hotel needs to be renovated. Not horrible ghastly things: a smell of smoke in rooms that are labeled non-smoking,flattened mattresses, sandpaper towels, or obvious safety issues--locks that aren't there, sparks spraying from antiquated appliances. But little things: threads fraying out of the upholstery, and the corners of the bathroom doors look as if they'd been gnawed by wolves. But these are things which CAN be fixed
