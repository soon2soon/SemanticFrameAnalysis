Had my first Limotainment bus ride last night and I could not be happier. First, Mike, the owner, is amazing. From initial contact to planning to day of the event, where we changed a venue on the fly, Mike was there to make sure it all went smoothly. Priest, our driver, was friendly, funny and was a fantastic driver. We all felt safe the entire time, even when we were being a bit goofy in the bus. The bus itself was clean, comfortable and the music system very solid. I know all of my friends I had on the bus had a fantastic experience, mostly because they have all emailed or texted me how much fun they had. If you are looking for a limo/bus for an event, I can not recommend Mike and Limotainment enough!
