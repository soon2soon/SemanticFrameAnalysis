I booked here for a stay cation over St Paddys Day weekend. I knew roads would close early and truthfully I had no desire to wake up at 5am to drive into the city. Our stay was great, but perhaps I'm just easy to please. The rooms on the lower levels can be dated so if you seek a more modern stay, request a room on one of their newly renovated floors. I didn't care and was quite happy with our two bed, two bath room. The hotel puts you in the center of everything, so yes, you will pay a premium. You can't expect to stay on Michigan Ave and expect a break. If looking for cheaper, go on groupon and seek out a different hotel . You probably won't be in the center if everything, but you'll catch a break. To save on parking, buy a package that includes it. I paid. $35 more a night and it included parking and breakfast for the length of our stay. Parking is $52-$58/day otherwise And breakfast $22/person. Buy the package, save hundreds. Also, if you eat at their restaurant, 720, all kids eat free with an adult meal. So you can save there as well. That said, we enjoyed the breakfast. There is A LOT to offer and everything was delicious. I happen to know one of the chefs here so I may be bias, but we had no complaints. The beds were typical of The Hilton brand. We slept great, staff was nothing but courteous, we did get help with baggage. I thought it as well worth it. I paid $568.00 for Fri-Sun, that included parking and breakfast. I could come and go as much as I wanted from the parking garage with no worries - all in all I'm a happy girl with it all. We got to the center of everything, built priceless memories, and for wanting to be near the parade and dyeing of the river, it served it's purpose for me! (:
