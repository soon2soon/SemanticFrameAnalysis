WOW!!!  They really know how to make your stay special. My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary there and the staff was more than accommodating!  From surprise champagne in our room to chocolate covered strawberries, to offering us a late checkout.  We felt very special. The hotel location is perfect and it's very beautiful inside. I would highly recommend it!!!
