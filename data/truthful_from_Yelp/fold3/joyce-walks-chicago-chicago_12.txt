We walked with Joyce on a blustery day, so it was just 2 of us plus Joyce. This made for a wonderful tour. We took our time with certain sites and never felt rushed. Any question we had, Joyce had an answer for us. Plus we stopped for some delicious Chicago hot-dogs. Much needed after walking for an hr and 30. I would recommend Joyce to any one who wants to explore some neighborhoods that they might not normally go to. Just a great time overall. Thanks Joyce!
