I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Palomar the weekend of the Chicago Marathon.  The staff was courteous, knowledgable and eager to help.  But two employees truly made a standout impression, Freida and Abdul. We had a family dinner in their ballroom.  Freida, the catering manager, attended to all the details and it was a splendid affair.  I planned a fancy dinner from over 500 miles away.  Because of Freida's attention to detail and dedication, I didn't have to worry about anaything.   The food was tasty and the views were second to none.   My room had the biggest tub (EVER) and I felt like I was at the height of luxury when I got in.  Everything about the place is just beautiful.  The art, decor, and colors are just perfect. On our final day in Chicago, we were heading back the airport when we repeatedly met with road blocks due to the Chicago Marathon route.  After exhausting all known options for returning to O'Hare, I called Hotel Palomar.  My call was routed to Albow who assured me that he could get me to the Airport.  He stayed on the phone guiding me based on which streets were available for public use. He acted as a human GPS! His patience and knowledge of the city streets were remarkable. The Hotel Palomar's location and appointments were excellent.  However, I was never more glad that I chose Hotel Palomar than when Abdul was on the phone helping me arrive at the airport with time to spare.  Even though I had already checked out and paid the bill, Abdul treated me like I was his only guest. I can recommend Hotel Palomar without reservation.
