This was my first time staying in a hostel so I have nothing to compare it to. But overall it was great experience. I arrived at midnight tired from a long day of traveling. I felt very welcome. I was given a room card that you needed to swipe to get through doors to go up the elevator. Then you have to swipe the card to get the elevator going. I thought those were ingenious ways of added security. The room I shared with 9 other women was clean (other than everyone's luggage laying around lol), the mattress & bedding were both very comfortable. Everyone is assigned a bed & a locker (you have to bring your own lock, though). I wasn't a fan of being on the top in bunk beds, though. There's just no way to gracefully climb up a tiny ladder & swing your leg over lol. There was a free breakfast which included a variety of cereals, bread items, fruit, yogurt, coffee & juice. I loved the location, it was right in the heart of all the sight seeing locations I wanted to see. I would definitely stay here again.
