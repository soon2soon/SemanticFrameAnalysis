This Holiday Inn was a big surprise. This hotel was amazing. From Ben at the front desk who was amazingly helpful polite and professional. To the abundance of hot water in the spa like shower. To the modern room with amazing views. This is not the Grizwalds Holiday Inn. Parking is a bit expensive at $45 a day but it's downtown Chicago.  That's the norm.  We found an amazing weekend rate of $65 per night on Priceline so shop around. This was a lucky and very comfortable and totally recommended hotel.
