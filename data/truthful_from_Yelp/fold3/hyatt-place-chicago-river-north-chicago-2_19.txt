The room rate seemed high to me but after our stay, I found it completely worth the price! This hotel was beautiful. The lobby was full of big comfy furniture and wrapped around into a bar area. I was impressed by the security. You can't even use the elevators without your room key. Our room was amazing. Huge room with a large L-shaped sofa & large TV. Our beds were super comfy. Amenities were great. We had plenty of towels and things for four of us. Valet service was worth the extra price. Our view faced south, where we could see lots of other buildings, including Sears (Willis) Tower. There was a fire dept across the street also, which constantly has calls. We stayed on the 11th floor and it wasn't bad. I only heard sirens once in the night when I was half asleep, otherwise it wasn't bothersome to us. They do provide earplugs if you are a lighter sleeper. Hotel staff members were all very helpful and kind. The breakfast was absolutely amazing for a hotel breakfast. Best I've ever seen! They had sausage, eggs, French toast, cereal, toast, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, yogurt bar, fresh fruit, etc. AMAZING. When we checked out, we were able to check our bags in for no additional charge. We spent the day walking around Chicago and came back to get our bags and car from valet when we were finished. It was great. Awesome service, awesome room, awesome stay. I will definitely go back. This was the best hotel I've ever stayed in.
