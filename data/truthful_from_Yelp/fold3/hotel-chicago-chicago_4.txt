Thank you Hotwire, AGAIN. We had a great experience at the Hotel Chicago.. Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend after Christmas, and considering the price we couldn't believe our good fortune.. The hotel is situated right in the middle of things, at one of the best locations in the city. We were able to check-in a bit early, and got a lovely room overlooking the river and the Chicago Theater sign. The room itself was relatively big, with a super comfy bed, nice big screen TV, and the modern sort of design we love. The bathroom was huge, and we really enjoyed using all the lovely toiletries and products they offered. Two things to improve on (but I'm sure they will): 1. The lobby is currently in reconstruction, so there wasn't much to see/do/talk about besides the room. 2. No free WiFi. This is getting ridiculous, come on hotel industry.. Get with it. Anyway - we got a lot more for the price than we were bargaining for, a great choice for some downtown Chicago fun.
