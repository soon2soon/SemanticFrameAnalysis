I just completed a 3 night stay at Hotel Palomar Chicago and boy am i impressed! I had a phenomenal stay and was blown away by the great customer service! The room was comfortable, the wine hour was a nice touch after a long day of meetings, the decor was fantastic, food fabulous, and even the aromatherapy in the lobby was an excellent touch! I was greeted by name every day by almost everyone. I can't remember everyone, but I wanted to thank Stan and Sam at the front door and Miles the Bellman for their friendliness and great attention to detail. This was my first stay here and I think I just may have a new hotel home when I'm back in Chicago!
