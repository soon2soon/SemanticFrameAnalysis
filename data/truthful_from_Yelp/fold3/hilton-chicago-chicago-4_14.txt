This hotel is such a classic. The historic traditional decor takes you back in time, at least in the main lobby. The Grand Ballroom is by far the most elegant in the city. Having the privilege to see several of their suites you can see they are shifting to a modern feel with updates and remodels. Superbly executed updates I might add. I sincerely hope they do not touch anything but the carpeting in the main lobby and ballroom. It would destroy an critical part of this hotels charm.
