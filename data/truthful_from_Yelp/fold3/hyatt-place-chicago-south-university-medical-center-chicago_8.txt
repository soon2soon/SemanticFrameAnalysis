We booked a group of rooms for our wedding this past May at this location of Hyatt. The hotel staff was AMAZING! Briana (the manager I worked with) was very helpful and professional. ALL of our guests ended up staying at this hotel, by chance, and everyone was raving about how kind, helpful, and professional the team at Hyatt Place Chicago-South were. I am so grateful and would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!
