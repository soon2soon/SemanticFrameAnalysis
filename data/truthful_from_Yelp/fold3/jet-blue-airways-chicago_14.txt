This review will be subjective at best, but screw you this is Yelp! Jetblue is the greatest American airline, hands down.   I've had experiences with Delta, USAir, and American that varied between unsatisfactory (Getting vacation luggage shipped to the opposite side of the country as the family) to miserable (Getting to the check in 40 minutes early instead of 45 and being told, no I would not be allowed to board this flight, despite being able to see the departing gate from the ticket booth, and then watching every flight for the next 8 hours to every airport within 400 miles cancelled) But Jetblue has always done right by me.  I'm sure if I was comparing them to Singapore or Lufthansa, they wouldn't be as good, but until they start offering US to US flights, I'm stuck with what I got. Jetblue is a bargain airline, and from time to time it shows.  However, for a majority of the time, JB actually performs better than the higher priced carriers.  Sure there's no first class, but I'm not paying 1200 bucks to go 400 miles unless it comes with an induction to the mile high club.   To paraphrase the most interesting man in the world, "I don't always fly, but when I do, I fly Jetblue."
