We have been to a lot Hosteling International hostels. The Chicago one is definitely one of our favorites. The rooms are very very clean, the service is very welcoming and helpful, and it has a lot of added amenities. For example, a full, healthy continental breakfast, ping-pong and pool in their large common room, and they give free tours around the city. The one we attended was called 'Stroll Chicago'. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. That, and we even got hot chocolate and cookies for free after the tour! We really love the fact that the hostiles through hosteling international are very community oriented. They have helpful volunteers ready and willing to give me hopeful information on the local area, and you get to meet people from all around the world. And our tour today we were the only American. We got to meet people from Germany, France, Austria, China and the Philippines. Everyone in our group was great!
