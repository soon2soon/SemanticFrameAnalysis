This was the perfect place to stay on our trip to Chicago. It was reasonably priced, close to the train, and walking distance (or short cab ride) to all tourist stuff we wanted to do. Unfortunately we did not make breakfast any of the days. We did use the pool, and it was nice to cool off in. We were able to leave our bags when our room wasn't ready so we could still go do things. The room was big and bathroom was updated.
