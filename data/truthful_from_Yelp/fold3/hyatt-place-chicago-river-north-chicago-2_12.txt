The Hyatt Place typical layout is perfect with an always included sofa bed in every room is a huge bonus. The suite layout standard is another huge bonus with the ottoman as a real pleasure to encourage hosting social times. Housekeeping quality is very high. Hyatt Place's standard Dr. Kenet supplies are a very nice touch to a huge & spacious Â & brightly lit bathroom. The relatively new construction of the property truly raises the standard of the stay. Its location in the centre of the city is a huge boon. Just 5 minutes' walk from the Magnificent Mile & Chicago River both with a bridge cross to Clark/Lake station means 1 seat ride to O'Hare Airport. The complimentary morning breakfast (marketing term "a.m. Skillet") is well attended but the seating is of a spaciousness & quantity such that all types of people in all sorts of seating arrangements even at peak load are accommodated. The variety of fresh baked goods, fresh fruits & eggs & sausages are a great boon to an already great stay. Bonus points for very high presentation points as the staff continuously clean the buffet area & usher used dishes off to the back.
