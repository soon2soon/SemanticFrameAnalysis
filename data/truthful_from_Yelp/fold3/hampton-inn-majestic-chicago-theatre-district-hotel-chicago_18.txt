This place is gorgeous! I stayed here for a few days in June while apartment hunting/touring the city with the boyfriend. Needless to say, I was very, very impressed. We stayed on the 23rd floor and had a great view of the buildings around us. The rooms were beautifully decorated with really high ceilings, elegant curtains, and the most comfortable bed EVER. This bed was huge! It could probably fit 5 people comfortably. I loved the pure white bed sheets and dark red walls - very different from typical hotels, but in a great way. Rooms also come with a large flat screen tv and wifi internet! Success! Customer service was great, the staff always helped us out whenever we needed directions, food places, and random inquiries. Whenever we came home from a long day of wandering the city, our rooms had brand new towels, sheets, and soaps. The breakfast that comes included in the rate was yummy. Not your typical room-temp eggs with microwaved bacon. There was fresh orange juice and grapefruit juice as well as fresh fruits and a good variety of things to eat. Only minor problem was the lobby size - it's a bit too small to host more than 20 people eating. I would definitely stay here again if my boyfriend didn't already have an apartment. Maybe I'll pick a fight the next time I'm there just to have a reason to stay here. Hehe, just kidding...
