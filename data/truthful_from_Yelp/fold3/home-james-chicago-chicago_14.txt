My now husband found Home James Chicago via other Yelp reviews, and they were dead on - Home James Chicago was great! We used them on our Wedding Day (6-16-12) to take our entire bridal party from our hotel downtown to various locations around the city to do pictures. Our limo-liner showed up on time, was clean, had the AC pumping, and as a bonus had an ice chest filled with cold waters and other assorted drinks. The driver was very courteous, and would help all the ladies in their dresses/heels get on and off the vehicle. We wrapped up pictures a bit early due to the heat outside, but the driver offered to wait at our hotel in case we needed him further. I thought that was kind considering we were already done with pictures. If I was to ever plan an event needing transportation in Chicago again, these guys would be the first company that I would call.
