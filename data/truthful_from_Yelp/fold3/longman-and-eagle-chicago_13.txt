Finally made it out here and it did not disappoint! Small in size, but cozy with a contemporary theme. Menu is somewhat limited while still offering a good variety of high quality products and preparations. Came in a bit late, seated immediately, friendly staff. As for our server and the food runner - felt they were very attentive and knowledgeable, our server answered the couple questions I had with ease and the gentleman bringing our food over explained each dish upon presentation. We had the meatballs and I thought I died and went to heaven - so savory and flavorful with the parsnip puree and huckleberry, I wanted to lick the bowl clean. Also had the bone marrow (which I have been wanting to try for a long time) and WOW. It was so incredibly rich and the pairing it came with cut through that perfectly. Also had the marinated octopus, which I did not like at all actually due to how potent the seafood smell/flavor was, but I feel as if this is something linked solely to a personal bias. I need to also comment on the presentation of the plates - they were absolutely stunning, all around perfect.
