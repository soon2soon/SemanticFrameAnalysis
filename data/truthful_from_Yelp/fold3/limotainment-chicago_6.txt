All I have to say to really get my point across is WOW!! These guys were great from the very beginning to the very end! Mike was super great to book the event with, he's funny, and very professional...he is there for anything you might need! Communication is quick and easy, prices are great, and their flexibility and services were fabulous! We got the big black bus for a Company Anniversary Event that took us out to a Pizza place, to downtown, and back to our hotel. The driver, Priest, was super friendly and was everywhere we needed him to be! The bus is SPECTACULAR! Super clean, fancy, fun, and was equipped with everything we needed! I would HIGHLY recommend these guys for any event you might be planning!!! If I could give them 10 stars I would!!!
