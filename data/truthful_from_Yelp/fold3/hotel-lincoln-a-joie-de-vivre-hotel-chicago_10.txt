Awesome time here! We never would've known where to start unless we get a fantastic deal on this hotel and it turned out to be just what we needed. An easy route from O'Hare and in a fun neighborhood literally a couple blocks from Second City, one of our must-dos on the list. The room was spacious, the beds a bit smaller but still comfy. I loved their bath products and the decor of the hotel overall. They have a rooftop bar which gets very busy on weekends and a coffee shop that we stopped by one morning. They also have a restaurant on site, but we didn't have a chance to eat there. Their computers are on the 2nd floor which makes it a breeze to print boarding passes. We missed their rooftop yoga since it was still cold, so sad. The front desk staff were good about giving us directions and suggestions in the neighborhood. By the end of our long weekend we had the bus system down. The bus across the street literally takes you right into the heart of everywhere you (tourists) want to go. Within walking distance of the hotel is Second City, lots of good restaurants and bars. It's just such a fun, great area. We got really lucky. I definitely would recommend the hotel because it's in good proximity to the bus so it's easy to get to the center and also up to Wrigleyville. We had a fabulous time and hope to be back again!
