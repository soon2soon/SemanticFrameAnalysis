Aw, hello beautiful city views! When I think of a Holiday Inn, I think of family road trips.  LONG family road trips.  When we finally stopped for the night, we sometimes ended up at a Holiday Inn.  I don't think I was every impressed (but that could be because I was so miserable from being stuck sitting in the middle of my sisters for 8 hours.) Needless to say, I don't associate the Holiday Inn with anything good or fun. Appropriately named, the Holiday Inn was hosting an Open House tonight in an attempt to #changeyourview of the hotel chain.  The rooms are beautiful with comfy beds, large working areas, free Wi-Fi and a bathroom stocked with Bath and Body works goodies.  Room service (wow!), a gym, pool and a bar are all supposed to be standard features of the hotel chain now.  Awesome!   The bar at this Holiday Inn has an AMAZING view. We even got to sample some a mint shot with absinthe (aka death) and cupcakes.  Before heading on the tour of the hotel, we were treated to some delish food - bacon wrapped dates, shrimp cakes, pasta with chicken.  Yum!  Everyone we met on the staff was super friendly and informative and you could tell that they were very excited about this brand re-launch.  Loved the enthusiasm! Thank you for the great tour, food, drinks and swag!  This really helped change my view of Holiday Inns!
