Giving 5 stars for location, cleanliness, price and pet policy. Its really the only hotel in downtown Chicago you can stay at with a dog over 30 lbs. Highlights: --NO pet fee! --FREE WiFi --Clean modern rooms (honestly a little nicer than I expected --Sheets/pillows were awesome --Good price for downtown Chicago Parking is separate space and $45/day but whaddya do....its right next to the hotel....and the pool is super small but whatever. Only downside would be the lack of green space for dogs....bathroom area is a tiny rock garden with bushes covering most of it. It worked though.
