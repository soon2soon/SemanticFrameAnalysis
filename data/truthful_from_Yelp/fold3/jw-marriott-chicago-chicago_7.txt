This was my first stay at this property and it was a great one. 1. The cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms, and the maid service was five star. The room was cleaned extremely well every morning and the turn down service was always done nice and classy. 2. The comfort of the room was exceptional. The bed was soft and the window shades were nice and thick as to keep the room dark. 3. The gym was the nicest Â hotel gym I've ever seen and I've stayed in a lot of these Marriotts. 4. The concierge room was the best stocked concierge room I've seen yet. Top notch. Overall this place was second to none. If you're in Chicago and looking for a great place to stay then this is the place.
