The star-rating is based strictly on the bathroom review! BATHROOM REVIEW -- I came here for a small conference and checked-out the bathrooms, and boy was I surprised! Nice and spacious urinals, and the stalls have ceiling-to-floor doors! It's almost like taking a dump in a walk-in closet. If you're stumbling drunkenly around downtown looking for somewhere to take care of business, come to this hotel, and use the nicely-kept bathrooms in the lobby and third-floor conference room bathrooms. You won't be disappointed. Sit or squat? SIT and have your dinner in the stall
