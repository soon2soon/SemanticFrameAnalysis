When it comes to a tour guide, you want someone with real local knowledge -- someone who knows the ins and outs of a place because they live there. And that's Joyce. Whether you're a local or an out-of-towner, you will learn something on her tours, and you'll have a great time along the way. My wife and I took both the Maxwell Street and Pilsen tours. On both, Joyce provided a lengthy (about 2.5 hours) itinerary with a good variety of stops, relating each neighborhood's ethnic history, significant developments and unique features. She also lets you experience a neighborhood firsthand, as it were: our Maxwell Street walk included a stroll through the market as well as a stop at the Maxwell St. hot dog stand; our walk through Pilsen featured a visit to a bakery for fresh goodies. Joyce is friendly, easygoing and knows her stuff. Put on your walking shoes and let her show you the real Chicago.
