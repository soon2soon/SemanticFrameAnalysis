Finally got the chance to stay here! My friend was visiting the U.S. for the first time from Germany and we were in Chicago 4 days (got an airbnb those 4 days) but then we were back in Chicago again the night before her flight out and decided to stay at HJ! I have been wanting to stay here for forever and happy I was finally able to! Really funky, modern yet super cozy all at the same time. It wasn't overly crowded but still enough people around to meet and make new friends. I really loved the decor and ambience and the layout of the rooms. I almost felt like I was staying at someone's home. Definitely stay here when in Chicago and you won't be disappointed!
