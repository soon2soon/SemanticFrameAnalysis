Love this hotel, and would stay here all the time if I got points here. The staff is professional and accomdating. The lobby always smells fresh, sometimes like green tea! The drinks and appetizers are delicious and the outside area is comfortabling and relaxing. The rooms have coffee machines which is a must for me, and I've never had any issues with any of the rooms. Definitely check this place out if you're in Chicago even if it's for a happy hour, you'll have a great view of the city as well :)
