This is now my current favorite place to stay while in Chicago.  Your classic, European boutique hotel.  Rooms are clean, modern (new) and have great character.  Beds and bedding are so good, you want to take them home with you.  The place is spotless clean.  Another thing I like is that its small compared to the other hotels in the area, so it has more of a local feel to it.  You can't beat the location, so much within walking distance. Less than a 5 minute walk to the red line L at State and Chicago.  And I am staying here this week for far less than $100/night.  Add to that a nice little lobby bar that's not full of business travel warriors and a french bistro cafe, what more could you want?  Love this place!
