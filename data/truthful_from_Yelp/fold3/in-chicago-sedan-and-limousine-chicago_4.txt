Booked Chicago Car Service this morning for an afternoon pick-up at O'Hare.  I had my toddler son with me, and our ride fell through.  The thought of standing in a 30 minute cab line in 15 degree temps with luggage, a toddler and a car seat was frightening. Chicago Car Service made it easy, we got our luggage, and were picked up within three minutes.  The driver brought all the baggage up to my door, and was extremely polite.  I'll be calling again soon!
