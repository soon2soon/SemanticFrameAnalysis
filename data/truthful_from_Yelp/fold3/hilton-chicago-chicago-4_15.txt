Stayed here on my honeymoon in 2000. I think I returned sometime in the middle years. And I stayed here recently on a Hotwire price cut deal. I shall return. What a grand classic hotel. Old Time. Wild. It defies the American logic of tearing down old buildings just because they have quirky design or plumbing. I say, bring on the classic quirkiness that only old hotels can provide. The front desk clerk was nice enough to upgrade me to an upper floor with a view of the lake, just because I asked. I love that. The elevator array alone is worth the price of admission. You just don't see a large room with three compete walls of elevators. Each wall of elevators has a specific range of floors. Very old school elevator logic, but I love it. You can be sure if it's Westinghouse.
