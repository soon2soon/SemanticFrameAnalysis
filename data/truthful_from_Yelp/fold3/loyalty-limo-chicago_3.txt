I considered/got quotes for a bunch of different limo services in the Chicago area before deciding on Loyalty Limo and I'm so glad I used them. I booked a Hummer limo for my best friend's bachelorette party. We got a super great deal using the Bachelorette Package that they provide which included the limo service for 6 hours with unlimited stops and 4 bottles of champagne/soda/water. Our driver's name was Desiree (spelling?) and she was amazing!! We ended up going to all of the places I had picked out beforehand plus a lot of additional places that the other girls in the bridal party wanted to check out. Desiree knew of all the places and their locations without us having to look anything up and she was super friendly and sweet! I will definitely use them again if needed!!
