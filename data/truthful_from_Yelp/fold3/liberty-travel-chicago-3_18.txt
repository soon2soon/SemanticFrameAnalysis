I highly recommend Liberty Travel for all your travel needs. I typically book trips online, but about two years ago I was planning a small group vacation to Mexico for my sisters 30th birthday and decided to try a travel agent. I found Liberty Travel online and called and spoke to Amanda Stevens who was extremely helpful and easy to work with. She was very informative and professional, and all my guests who spoke to her had nothing but good things to say.  Two years later I got engaged and decided on a destination wedding, so I contacted Liberty Travel and was so elated to hear the Amanda was still with the company. I invited over 200 guests to my wedding and Amanda is handling all their travel arrangements including hotel, airfare, travel insurance and airport transfers.  Amanda works out of the Lincoln Park office but agreed to meet my Fiance and I in the Schaumburg location when we were newly engaged so we could review all my wedding details and options. She has traveled to many of the places that I was considering booking my wedding at and she even showed me some of her personal photos so I could get an idea of what the resorts looked liked.  My guests have been communicating with Amanda on a weekly basis by phone and email and all have told me on numerous occasions that she responds right away and is very helpful. Many of my guests have been booking flights on their own and Amanda never makes them feel bad if they choose not to book flights through Liberty Travel.  Amanda is super organized and updates me weekly on the status of my guests so that I can work with my resort on all the planning needs for my wedding. I am now going to use Liberty Travel for my honeymoon and will continue to use them for future needs.  Contact Liberty Travel today, you wont be disappointed.
