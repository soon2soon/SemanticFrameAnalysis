Took the family to Chicago for Thanksgiving! This place is perfect for families and such a celebration. If you're coming to downtown Chicago, don't overlook this great hotel.  Certainly will be back! Pros: Very attentive staff, especially the doormen (thank you Amer) Very good complimentary hot breakfast Very good complimentary hot supper (Mon. thru Thurs.) Clean large rooms Full kitchen (sans oven) Great location Free Wi-Fi Cons:   $55 per day car valet fee (but it's Chicago!) Hint:  Trader Joes and Jewel Grocery nearby; LYFE Kitchen is great for gluten free food!
