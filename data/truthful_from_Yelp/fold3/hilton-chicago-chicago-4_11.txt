This place is absolutely amazing!!! I'm here for a conference and they have been amazing! My room has a view of Grant Park which is awesome, not to mention that it is broken into two rooms which is pretty cool as well! Everything in this place says classy, and while it is a bit pricy, it is well worth it!
