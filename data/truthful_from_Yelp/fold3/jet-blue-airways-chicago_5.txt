Flew it for the first time, round trip ORD to JFK and back. I considered this a value airline and generally try to stay away from these where possible, but was pretty impressed. Cost of the ticket was a pretty good deal so I was nervous about having another Spirit Airlines disaster-like experience; it was not. The seat backs have tv screen with DirectTV. Choice of snacks, drink prices weren't too expensive. We shared a carry-on but I believe first bag checked is free. I need to look this up but I read somewhere that for $35 you can get upgrade to get extra room and also bypass the normal security line. Next time I have a 7:50 am flight out of JFK I am going to definitely look into that option, that terminal is chaos on an early Monday morning!
