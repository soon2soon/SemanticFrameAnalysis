I recently stayed at this hotel for my 1 yr anniversary with my girlfriend, and it could not have been any better than it was. Everyone there Â went above and beyond for both of us. Honestly from what I saw they did that for every guest. From the woman who checked us in to and another desk agent that checked out bags so we could go out on our last day, all the way to the valets. At no time did I feel anything but calm, relaxed, and just pleased I had decided to stay there. I managed to take advantage of the spa facilities and had one of the best massage experiences to date. I would say you would be giving up a lot by not having one. I don't think I could or would stay anywhere else when I return to Chicago next.
