We loved our Chinatown tour with Joyce!  It just so happened that our group of 4 were the only people on the tour so that was great.  Joyce showed us all around Chinatown and made me feel much more comfortable about walking around down there know that I know where to go.  She introduced us to the history, culture, and her favorite spots.  We loved going to the park - something I never would have found on my own.  We have returned many times to try out her recommendations!  Would definitely do a walk in a different neighborhood with Joyce again! 362/365
