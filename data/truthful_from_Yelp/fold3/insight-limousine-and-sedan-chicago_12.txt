We used Insight Limousine for our wedding on July 13, 2013.  We can't recommend them highly enough.  Jorge arranged not only our limo service, but shuttle service for our guests as well.  He was prompt, professional, and very kind.  His rates beat the competition, and the service was first rate.  Jorge himself handled the driving responsibilities, and was incredibly patient, as our wedding ran late.  The limo was clean and comfortable, and all our rides were very smooth.  Jorge runs a great business, and looks out for the customer.  Check out Insight!
