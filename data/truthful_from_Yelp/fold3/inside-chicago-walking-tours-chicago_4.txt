My sister and I used a Groupon to book this tour so we chose the River North tour based on timing . Turns out we were the only ones on the tour so Hilary asked us what we wanted to see. Like everyone else we've been to Chicago several times for the shopping and the shows and food but we got to see a whole new version of Chicago. We saw churches, old buildings with great descriptions of the architecture and historical tidbits that were all within a few blocks of Michigan Ave. the walk was leisurely and paced to enjoy the sights. Hilary knows a lot and shares history in a fun, entertaining fashion. The time went by quickly and we felt like we made a new friend when we were done.
