I stayed here as I was in town for an interview. It was really close to the subway and easy to find. I loved the neighborhood, plenty to do once you figure out where to go. Was an easy walk to the Magnificent Mile and other Chicago hot spots...even in the winter. Room was unique and the bed was THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING I'VE EVER SLEPT ON. I had a very strange experience where there was a group of partiers decided to hang out at that hotel the same weekend that I was there. They were so rude and loud, getting into fights in the hall way and causing so much noise...screaming at the top of their lungs, pounding on doors. At one point one the guys tried to break into his buddy's room across the hall from mine. I'm not even someone who typically gets bothered by this stuff, but it was pretty extreme. It finally escalated to the point where I called the front desk at 4am and they assured me someone would be on it. I thought they would ignore it, but literally 30 seconds later a security guard/bouncer broke them up and kept checking back to make sure they quieted down. One of the best responses to a disturbance I have ever seen. Thank you guys so much for that. I tried to thank the security guard the next day, but he wasn't around in the morning. Really showed that they valued their guests right to rest. I don't do Yelp reviews ever, but felt like they really deserved to be recognized for that. Definitely a great place to stay!
