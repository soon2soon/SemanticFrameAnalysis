We used up four of the five rooms in this place last weekend for our out-of-town wedding guests.  They all loved it!  The rooms are large and nice with their own private bathrooms.  Parking on the street was very easy - even when we had a bunch of guests meet us there after the reception. As for that, we used the back porch and patio for our after dinner party and it was wonderful.  They just redid the whole back area and it looks great!  They were very accommodating and set up a table downstairs for us to use and even provided a couple extra coolers so we could keep some wine, beer and sodas on both levels.  They even have outdoor speakers so you can use your iPod to play music outside!  We had about 30 guests outside over all and it was a good size space for that many people.   A few of the guests are already planning their next visit there, so it must have been a nice place to stay!  I'm just glad that everyone liked it and that the party there worked out as well as it did.  It's a great neighborhood gem!
