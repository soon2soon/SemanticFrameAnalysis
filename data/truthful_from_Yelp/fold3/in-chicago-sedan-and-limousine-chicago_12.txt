I have experienced great service using this company. The owners and staff of the company are highly organized and professional. I have never had an issue waiting on any of my pick ups. The vehicles are always clean and odor free. I would definitely recommend using In Chicago Sedan for any future services needed and also be sure to leave a review and tell someone else about your experience. This company is Chicagolands best!
