A cool restaurant gem in Chicago that doesn't have the interior design, location or swanky smell of a Michelin star restaurant, but has the select dishes that'll rock your taste buds. Prices were a little high, but once you have few cocktails in your system and the numbers on the menus start to look a little fuzzy, this place can be worth every dime. Friends and I ordered a number of small dishes and a few entrees to share, and all were fantastic. The Swedish meatballs (not the kind you get at Ikea) were dressed in a very nice sauce and the pork loin was ridiculously tender. The ribeye was good as well, but I've definitely had better portioned steak dishes for less - shout out to House of Prime Rib SF! Beef tartare was good despite being a little over-salted for my liking. And last but not least, the Venison sausage was surprisingly great but partially because I had the least expectations for it in comparison to the other epic meat entrees. We had a dessert dish (bananas foster crepe, I think?) that was really awesome but could've been better without the random rum-flavored jelly that they served it with. Best memories included (but are not limited to): the waiter tearing up the vegetarian menu in my face when I told him I was allergic to vegan food, the gnarly ol' fashions my friend Brent and I scarfed down before our meal, the amazing pork loin dish and the duck foie gras that I should not admit that I ate (and enjoyed!) if I expect to date any animal rights activists in the future. Not-so-great: Lighting was too dim for me because I'm scared of ghosts & Chicago is really cold
