Excellent!  Everything from the service to the room to the location, 5 stars.  Stayed here for 2 nights for business.  Upon arriving, bellman helped me with all my luggage.  Check in was quick and efficient.  Room and bathroom were huge, with all the new amenities.  Location was excellent - right across the street from Lincoln Park.  They have a coffee shop for breakfast, and a rooftop bar for late night food and drinks.  Their fitness room is a little small - 3 treadmills, but plenty of free weights that goes up to 70lbs I believe. Tip:  If you need to get to O'Hare airport on a weekday morning from here, look for it to take at least 1 hour and 15 min.
