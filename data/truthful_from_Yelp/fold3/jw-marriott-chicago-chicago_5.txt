Spent the night at this beautiful hotel with my wife when we were in town for my sister's baby shower.  We had the corner suite, room 1019, facing the Willis Tower.  On average, I spend about 100 nights each year in Marriott properties for work and JW Marriott consistently is my favorite marque to spend a night. Our room had a beautiful bathroom with a large terrazzo shower. The king size bed was covered with large, soft pillows.  Everything was clean.  The houndstooth pillows are also a nice touch. We ordered late night room service of the basics, cabernet for her, a Sierra Nevada for me, a cheese plate, and the seared Ahi Tuna salad with quinoa. Everything tasted excellent. We also took advantage of the complimentary breakfast on the executive floor.  It could have used a protien (bacon, sausage, or turkey patties) as well as bagels, but there were juices, scrambled eggs, croissants, and fruit.  The highlight, for me, was the espresso machine.  I made a black-eye for breakfast and a red-eye to go!  Staff was friendly and we were even asked where we were from ("Well, Chicago, but we live in St. Louis currently.) This is an excellent property if you are in Chicago.  Valet is expensive at $60 per night, but otherwise, you'll be pleased.
