Fantastic location! Spacious rooms with kitchen and separate living room. The provided a pack n play for our baby. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Valet parking wasn't bad either for one night it was $26 which is not bad for Chicago's ridiculous prices. Also it includes hot breakfast and dinner (M-F). Fun indoor pool with city view!
