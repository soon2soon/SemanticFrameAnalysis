What a wonderful, wonderful hotel. Everybody was incredibly polite and so helpful - Sasha, Bill, and Zhanna were great, and Gretchen gets a gold medal in amazing customer service. Our flight didn't leave until much later in the day, and we were going to schlep our incredibly heavy bags all over the city. Without us even asking, Gretchen offered to hold them for us so that we could enjoy ourselves. This is after we had already checked out! We were bowled away. The room was classy and extremely clean, with a beautiful view. Can't wait to go back.
