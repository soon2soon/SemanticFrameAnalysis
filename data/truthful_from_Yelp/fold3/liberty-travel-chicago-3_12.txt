This was my first time using a travel agency.  Shavahn helped us plan our honeymoon in Greece.  It was super, super easy and she took care of everything! She even booked our transfers from the airport to the hotel, which I think will make traveling a whole lot easier.  She was also very patient with us when we kept changing our minds about how long we wanted to stay in Athens and how much money we wanted to spend.  My parents also used Shavahn to book their 30th wedding anniversary trip to Italy and they had a similarly smooth time.  She went out of her way to get both of us great deals.  Fantastic!
