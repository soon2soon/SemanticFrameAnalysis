Stylish, welcoming boutique hotel. Has a sense of calm and class about it. Â  Very friendly front-desk staff. WONDERFUL Intelligentsia coffee, tea, and newspapers in the lobby each morning. Wine hour in the afternoon. Nice CO Bigelow products in the bathroom. Rooms are on the small side, but you can get a nice view of the city if you're up high enough. NB you are *right* on State, so you will hear a lot of street noise (though honestly it wasn't THAT bad--they were repairing the street overnight during my stay, and I still managed to get rest. If I can sleep through jackhammers, I imagine that a "normal" night isn't that bad. Beds were super comfy. And, if you're an architecture nut, it's really a treat to stay in a historically significant building like this. I studied architectural history in college, and little did I know I'd actually stay in a building we discussed! Very cool. I would definitely stay here again.
