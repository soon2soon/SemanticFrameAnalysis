I stayed here with a friend for two nights. It's VERY cute inside and very welcoming. Didn't meet a single staff member who wasn't nice. I'm writing the review because I had food poisoning my first night there (airport food), and I was vomiting all night long. Not only did they bring up everything I asked for, but (embarrassing as this is) I vomited in a paper bag and it leaked.. and they were so beyond kind about disposing of it and cleaning up. I left a big tip for housekeeping when I left the room. Kind of an embarrassing story to share, but wanted to share it because they were all so kind and helpful.
