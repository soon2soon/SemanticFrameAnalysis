We found the perfect hotel!  The wonderful staff, from the friendly doorman, to the great check in staff and the kind housekeepers, made our stay even better.  This hotel was very close to the Magnificent Mile, one block, and by the bus stops!  The hotel is close to a hospital, but they even give you ear plugs!  The noise did not bother us. Our room was clean, very comfortable and roomy.  The rooms, hallways and open areas were clean and fresh smelling.     They have a great exercise room and the pool was perfect for our daughter.  At the deepest point of 4 feet it was great for lap swim but even better for playing.   They have a great bar and restaurant in the hotel and the entry has a Starbucks.  There are many very close restaurants and breakfast places close.  Gino's is just up the street!  We can to visit The Museum of Contemporary Art, which was about a 5 minute walk.  American Girl was a smidgen further.   There is a close Walgreens, where we were able to get our bus debit cards.  Within moments of great shopping, food and buses and taxis.   Our comfortable room had a great shower with great water pressure, the beds were comfortable and like heaven after a day walking all around.  We had a fridge, which was great for the leftover pizza! The location was great, the rooms were wonderful and the staff were outstanding!  It really helped make our trip so enjoyable.
