The Hyatt Magnificent Mile was an excellent choice for our wedding room block!  Despite our wedding being on New Years Eve, the hotel offered very competitive rates and the best attrition policy of the hotels that I looked at  (for those who don't know attrition fees are applied when a hotel block cannot fill a certain percentage of the contracted number of rooms).  This is definitely something to consider when comparing hotel room block options for brides/grooms-to-be as it could be money out of your pocket if you aren't mindful of the policies!  Like I said, the policy we had was very reasonable. The staff at the Hyatt was great, ESPECIALLY our main contacts Alyssa and Mary.   We were amazed by the level of attention we received in the planning phases given that the wedding festivities were all offsite.  Alyssa and Mary were extremely responsive and even scheduled a full meeting with us to go through the day's events to ensure hotel staff was aware of the schedule of events.  They were also available for multiple walk throughs of the Presidential Suite and potential 'first look' spots as we conducted wedding planning.  A huge thank you to them and their team as they went above and beyond for us. The presidential suite and king suites are very nice.  The LevelTwo bar was great for family gatherings after the rehearsal dinner and reception and there was plenty of seating for morning brunch.  I would highly recommend the Hyatt Magnificent mile for a Chicago stay, and especially as a venue for a room block!
