Found ourselves here due to a Groupon.  Location was perfect and everyone and everything* we encountered was excellent.  The bed was SO comfortable, with a variety of pillows to choose from.  Soft sheets, warm comforter, nice textured blanket...made me glad we stayed two nights. On every floor they provide a Continental Breakfast every morning.  Fresh fruit, oatmeal, bagels, coffee...you name it.  Very nice. There's also a lounge on one of the top floors that offers free happy hour snacks.  The snacks were nice, the beer was inexpensive ($3) but the martini special got the * above.  $8 for a watered down old thing from a pitcher.  That was the only off note of the whole stay.
