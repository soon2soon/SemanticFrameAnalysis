My boyfriend and I booked a room here back in July for his birthday weekend. Before even arriving in Chicago, I had connected with @SaxChicago on Twitter and was really impressed by how active and helpful they were via social media. Not only did they recommend bakeries and nice restaurants for his birthday, they even surprised up with a complimentary bottle of champagne in our room upon arrival! Beyond the awesome customer service, the hotel was beautiful and made my first trip to Chicago memorable :) Can't wait to go back!
