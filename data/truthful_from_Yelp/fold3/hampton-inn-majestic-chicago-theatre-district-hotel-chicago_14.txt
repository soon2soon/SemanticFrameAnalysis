Our flight into Chicago was delayed and sadly we missed our connecting flight to Rome. We decided to make the best of it and looked for accommodations near the Art Institute. This place was just a couple of blocks away and right off the train. Since the airline still had our luggage we were travelling light, too light. Our room was very reasonable - about $130 and had the most comfortable bed I've slept in in a while. The room was beyond just clean and comfortable, it was stylish in the way that hotel rooms usually aren't. And the breakfast was much more than I expected - waffles, muffins, eggs, meat products, juice, cereal, yogurt, fruit. If I'm ever in Chicago again I'm staying here.
