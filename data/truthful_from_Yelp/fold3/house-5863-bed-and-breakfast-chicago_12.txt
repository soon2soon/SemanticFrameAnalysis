This place was wonderful! My girlfriend and I stayed here one night, and we both wished we had booked it for more. The people who worked there were so friendly and helpful (they let us keep our bags in the living room hours after checkout,) and everything was very clean and unique. It stormed in the morning and we got to watch the rain and trees beating against the gorgeous, wide windows with a great view of the neighborhood. They keep food and snacks stocked in the totally modern kitchen throughout the day, which makes it feel so much more like staying with friends than at a hotel or creepy, antiquated home. I would recommend this place to anyone.
