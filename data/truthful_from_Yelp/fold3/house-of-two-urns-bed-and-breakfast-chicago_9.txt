I stayed for a week recently at the House of TwoUrns after being granted a Writer's Residency fellowship for 2011. I was nervous at first and not sure what to expect. When I arrived, however, I was warmly and immediately greeted by Kapra Fleming who even helped me carry my suitcase up the stairs to the La Alcova Suite on the third floor. Man oh man! Â I live in a small studio in the Ravenswood area and was shocked by the amount of space, light, and incredibly comfortable decor that I was provided. I could go on and on. I do like living in small spaces (less cleaning involved), but love to stretch out once or twice a year at a comfortable B&B. Kapra even invited me to a wonderful dinner on Saturday that included her friends and family. Free off-street parking and no measurable snow for the early January week I was there topped off my wonderful experience at the House of TwoUrns!
