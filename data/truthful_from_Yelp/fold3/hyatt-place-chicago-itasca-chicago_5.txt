I recently stayed here for a 4 night business trip. Besides that fact that it was snowing and cold as ____, I had a great time. ALL of the employees were nice and helpful the entire stay. I had a little tour when I first checked in, it made me feel all VIP status. lol. They have a free shuttle, (I think it wil take you anywhere within 5 mile radius) and I used it since I was there a few days without a rental car. The guy took me to the grocery store and patiently waited for me to come back out. It was rad. But the continental breakfast...thats a whole different story. It was off the hook! I was impressed. They had a variety of goodies, from warm breakfast sandwiches to fruit/ cereal/pastries. Usually the "continental breakfast", is stale bagels and maybe some oatmeal. I recommend trying out Buona Beef, located in the same parking lot as well.
