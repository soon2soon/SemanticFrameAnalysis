The Loews House of Blues is part of the revitalized Marina City complex along the Chicago River. It is a cool hotel with a funky design. You get a free CD when you check in, a neat musical touch. The interiors are colorfully decorated, with boldly striped walls and artistically framed mirrors and set pieces. The hotel is in the former office building of this concrete complex.
