OK. So, thanks to Yelp, I was able to get the ladies in town during Lolla weekend for one of their bachelorette's. And, despite already being overbooked, they accommodated my plea to pick up the ladies (of course, who were traveling to Midway and Ohare, at all hours of the night), and save me about 5 hours of a migraine. I have one more reservation left on my Yelp deal -- so keep up the good work!
