This hotel is AMAZING. The location is perfect, the rooms are great (sort of a modern chic feel), and the price is right (though we were staying at a negotiated corporate rate--actual rates may vary I suppose). But what really puts this place over the top is the great customer service from the staff. There wasn't a request that I made that wasn't received with a smile and a helpful solution. I've seriously never encountered a hotel staff as friendly as the employees at Hotel Sax. I'll definitely return here if I'm ever in need of a room downtown again.
