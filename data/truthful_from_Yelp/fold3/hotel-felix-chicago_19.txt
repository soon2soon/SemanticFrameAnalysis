I don't know what everyone on yelp is talking about! I had a fantastic experience for New Year's Eve! Yeah, the rooms are small, but the service was great. After we parked our car, my friend realized she left her dress in the car and they made sure she got it. And we didn't even get yelled at for being loud, and we were loudddddd! Great hotel for a little getaway!
