This is the perfect setting for a creative meeting offsite! Book a large suite for your group of 8 or fewer and you will have the time of your office-hating lives. Fun decor, lots of space, and a very responsive catering department. I've only seen the blues brothers suite (that was where we held a number of meetings) but I can vouch that it is a great place for ideations and strategic brain storming sessions.
