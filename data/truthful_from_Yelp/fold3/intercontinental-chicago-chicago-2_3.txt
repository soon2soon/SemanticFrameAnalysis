I got a room on Priceline Express deals but was not treated like a Priceline customer (which is a good thing). I called the hotel prior to check-in and requested a room with double beds (as opposed to 1 king size bed). I was told that I couldn't be guaranteed anything, but when I arrived I was surprised to find out that my request had been notated and I got the double beds; this works great for a family of four. The location is ideal: on Michigan Av. in the heart of 'The Magnificent Mile.' The pool is an architectural gem and the fitness facilities are also great. There is a very nice Starbucks, as well as, Michael Jordan's Steakhouse with entrances in the lobby. My wife and I have stayed in quite a few downtown Chicago hotels and this is definitely one of the best!
