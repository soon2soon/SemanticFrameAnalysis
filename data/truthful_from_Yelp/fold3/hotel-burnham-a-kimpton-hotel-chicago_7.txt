This was my first time staying in a Kimpton hotel and it was such a wonderful experience. For my birthday I wanted to stay at hotel downtown but I booked it somewhat last minute and this was the best deal I could find (that being said, it was still very pricey and way above my budget). However, from the moment I arrived I was so happy with this hotel! The front desk staff was very friendly and took time to have a meaningful conversation with me. They invited me to their wine hour in the afternoon, which I later attended and enjoyed. I arrived to the room which was really cute! I was nervous from all the yelp reviews about the rooms being small and was looking into upgrading to a suite. But I didn't need to at all. Yes it was smaller, but we were able to fit 3 grown adults just fine. After about 10 minutes of getting settled in the room, a staff member brought up a bottle of wine and a happy birthday note. It was such a nice touch! My parents drove up to the city to have dinner with us at the hotel's restaurant (see review for Atwood) and that was lovely. The best part is, if you are a guest of the hotel you receive a nice discount on your restaurant bill (you may need to let the waiter know you are staying at the hotel though). Things I loved: the infused water they always seemed to have available, the overall decor and architecture, the REAL keys, and the location of this hotel! I'll need to save up a bit, but I'd love to come back again!
