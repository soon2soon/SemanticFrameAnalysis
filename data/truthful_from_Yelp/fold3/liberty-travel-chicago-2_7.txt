This is about the Liberty Travel in Lincoln Park (2443 N. Clark St). I didn't know that they matched online pricing and have access to deals / plane seats that I can't see on kayak. Robyn was super nice and helpful and we ended up paying less than the cheapest flight on kayak. I also appreciated the travel insurance (we ended up using it!) she offered. Highly recommended.
