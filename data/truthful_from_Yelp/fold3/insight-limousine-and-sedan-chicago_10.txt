I called Insight last Wednesday looking for a car to take our group to the opening night of the Garth Brooks concert.  George was very accommodating and gave me several options.  The car showed up on time and the driver, Hugo, was a delight.  Courteous and friendly, he went the extra mile to make our trip enjoyable and stress-free.  He delivered us to the door leading right to our seat section and was waiting for us when the concert was over.  The car was immaculate and looked brand new.  I recommend this company highly for their excellent customer service, attention to detail, and professionalism!
