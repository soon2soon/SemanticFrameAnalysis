Let me start by saying I am writing this review without even having used their services.   I called, Jim answered, I asked him if I could use my voucher ($30 service for $15) over the phone, he said "sure, when did you need it for?"  I told him i was planning a little surprise for my boyfriend tonight and I wanted him to be picked up from his apartment in Ravenswood Manor and driven to Hotel Monaco.  Jim said they were completely booked but then proceeded to say "you know what, let me look at the schedule and see if I can squeeze you in.  I'll call you back in a little bit." About 20 minutes later, Jim called and said they were completely booked but he wanted to help me out so he referred me to a competitor but one he trusted.  Not only was I impressed with his desire to try and accomodate me and my last minute planning, but he was so friendly and eager to help me out that he suggested I use a competitor as he knew they would be able to work with me. All of my business from now on will go to Jim and In Chicago Car Service purely based on my experience.
