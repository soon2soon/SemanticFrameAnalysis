This was my first hostel experience. I am a couchsurfer at heart. I did not realize I had booked my Chicago trip when Loolapoolza was happening, so finding a host was not happening. I read the reviews for this place and took a chance. And it paid off!! Great staff, clean rooms, great spaces throughout the hostel. I love the rooftop patio!! too bad there is not a portapotty up there! ha! I loved meeting new people from around the world and doing a variety of activities with different people. I was suppose to leave and go to a host's home for the weekend but changed my mind and stayed the rest of the week there. The subway is a block away. A huge selection of places to eat and drink. And the Walgreen's is open 24 hours and you can buy booze there! Awesome! I will stay there again if I make it back to Chicago :0)
