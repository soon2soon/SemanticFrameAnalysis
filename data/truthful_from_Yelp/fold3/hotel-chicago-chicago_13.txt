We absolutely loved this hotel!  Having never been to Chicago before I was a little concerned because the price seemed too reasonable especially considering the price of the surrounding hotels.  But the reviews had been good, the location was perfect and I liked the photos.  So, we decided to go for it and could not have been any happier.  The staff went above and beyond our expectations, the rooms were recently remodeled and beautiful and they even had martini makings waiting for us.  What more  could we ask for!  I will go back here again and recommend it to all my friends.
