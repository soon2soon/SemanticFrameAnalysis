We LOVED the Kinzie. Booked a corner king room on Christmas Eve and arrived early, but they had rooms available and let us check in early at no extra cost. The lobby is unpretentious and somewhat small, but the rooms are fantastic. Great city view, loved the modern styling and the bed was comfy. The free drinks at happy hour and complimentary breakfast were great perks. The breakfast includes items like cereal, yogurt, Danishes, OJ and coffee, etc. Location is everything -- only about a 10 min walk from Millennium Station and the hotel itself is right in the heart of a ton of restaurants and bars, plus only 10-15 min walk from shopping. Â At the price -- we paid only $140 including everything -- it can't be beat. Room included a mini fridge and a keurig, plus bath robes. Concierge was helpful and professional. Don't think they were very busy being the holiday, but our floor was very quiet. Would come back and recommend to anyone!
