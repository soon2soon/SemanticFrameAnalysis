For a Hostel, and I've stayed at a few, this one was clean, convenient, and secure. What more could you want! I had a private room which was really nice. It was clean and overall the hostel was very quiet. The room was very spacious and WAY cheaper than anything else I could find in the Loop area. It is located close to everything including the Metra and L stops so it's easy to go anywhere in the city. They will check your bag for you which was extremely helpful! I checked my bag in way before check-in time and they also let me keep it there for a few hours after I checked out. The cafe connected to it, Cafecito, is also really good! If you want to see Chicago on a budget, I highly recommend HI Chicago for all of your lodging needs.
