I love me a Kimpton Hotel! The Palomar is so completely lovely and I will come back Â when I return to this fabulous city. We were upgraded upon check in to a corner room with a spa that I happily used at least once a day. The room was gorgeous and quite large to we were really able to spread out. The 14th floor view was also quite nice and the location is excellent. Loved all the amenities here including an umbrella and yoga mat in the closet! Free wifi and $10 mini bar credit for being in the loyalty program. Sweet! Excellent, friendly and immediate service anytime I called for the valet for the car or housekeeping for more towels. Free coffee bar in the morning and happy hour wine at 5:00 in the lovely lounge. I love that they are pet friendly and next time would love to bring my furry kids. We were presented with a bottle of Moet for our anniversary, which was a very nice touch that was greatly appreciated. The only unfavorable things was parking was $60 a night, which is a bit spendy, even by big city standards.
