My mother and I went on the river north tour over Father's day weekend and had a fabulous time! Being native Chicagoans, we weren't sure if we would learn very much but our guide Hillary shared some sights, facts and buildings that we didn't know about...I don't want to ruin any of the surprises. Hillary is very passionate about Chicago's history and architecture. Don't hesitate to take one of tours!
