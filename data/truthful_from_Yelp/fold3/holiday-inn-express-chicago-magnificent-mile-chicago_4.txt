We had a great time here! Perfect location, free wifi and breakfast. We checked in and Corey was so helpful, deciding to take care of problems before they even arose. The staff here has been so friendly, and everyone has been so unbelievably helpful. Perfect price, perfect location (trader joes and starbucks across the street? Yes please) this hotel is sure to be a stop on our list again!
