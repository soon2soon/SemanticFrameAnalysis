Really cute place! It's like a bunch of 1940s mail room offices converted into hotel rooms-- it's a "Mad Men" themed Hotel -- kind of! The people are so friendly and nice. Very helpful. We came down for free coffee but it had been packed up so they brought us up a tray of coffee! Loved it. Great restaurant in first at floor as well. Dog friendly!! We had two massive Bernese dogs and they were loved! Doggie bags complimentary! Amazing. Fab location! Like perfect. Right near a subway stop, right next to Washington park and the bean! Shops everywhere around. Brilliant location. I didn't notice the renovations when staying either. The only thing I want/ would suggest is a body wash in the bathroom- they have shamp/ condit/ body lotion but no wash. Also parking was like $55 overnight for a guest - which I feel should be included in your stay. But maybe that is a Chicago thing!?!
