I went here on the recommendation of a few coworkers to go for the brunch. It's a really cool whiskey bar (no TV's or anything) with original decoration. I really wanted to get the biscuits and gravy with eggs but was disappointed to find out that they only serve it on the weekends. Instead I got the PBR Breakfast which was 2 eggs (actually more like 3-4) potato hash with delicious bacon cooked in, and choice of breakfast meat (I chose sausage links). I also got brioche toast on the side. The food was incredible and the portions were enormous. My fianc√© got the croquet de Madame which was very good. The fries were incredible.
