We sought out the help of a travel agent for booking our honeymoon.  There are just so many options and we were soon overwhelmed.  Alison (who was previously at the Lincoln Park location but is now in their downtown location) was extremely helpful in suggesting the kinds of resorts and destinations we were looking for.  She listened to what our priorities were and suggested the best place in our budget.  She was responsive with any questions we had afterwards and even followed up to check we were safe after hearing of some unexpected weather in our destination.  I would definitely recommend Liberty and especially Alison for any trips you might have coming up!
