Absolutely loved this hotel. My gf and I have stayed in several hotels in chicago and this is by far our favorite.  The whole hotel has been newly renovated and is Very trendy and modern. We loved the room with the accent lights everywhere.  The bed was nice and loved having a big screen mounted on the wall. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and anytime we we needed anything it was brought to our room and it was complementary.  Overall I cannot think of anything we have been disappointed about and will definitely be staying here next time we come to Chicago.
