Mike and the entire crew at Limotainment are a pleasure to work with. We used them for our September 1 wedding, mostly because of all of the stellar Yelp! reviews. We were looking for a bus company that was affordable, reliable, clean and lacked stripper poles. I wouldn't think that was too much to ask, but in our search, that turned out to be a fairly tall order. However, from start to finish, Limotainment didn't disappoint. Mike was quick to reach out to schedule our event and efficient with checking in leading up to the day. The bus arrived early, nice and cool (it was a HOT day) and was completely stocked with everything we would need. In addition, the sound system was bumping and the bus was very clean and comfortable. Our wedding party had a blast! Our driver took us exactly where we needed to go and when he did get stuck circling the block, we never waited long. I would definitely use Mike and Limotainment again for an event and would highly recommend them for a wedding. They're very professional and affordable!
