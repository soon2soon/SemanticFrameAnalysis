Lemme update this thing with a dessert I tried recently. Black Sesame Doughnut, Coconut Tapioca, Black Sesame Puree, Powdered Coconut, Lime, Coriander, Lime & Palm Sugar Granita, Coconut Sorbet...um. Wow! I had this dessert craving that I needed to fulfill. Went to this place and saw their dessert menu. Absolutely amazing. Now on to the actual dessert. Didn't know what to expect or how this would be presented. I wish it wasn't so dark because I would have taken a picture! It was beautiful. A few small donuts that were airy, and flavorful. The tapioca was a night delicate touch with the lime and palm sugar granita and the lime gel. I loved the coconut sorbet as well! Not as strong as a coconut flavor as I'd like but it was delicious how it combined with the lime. The black sesame puree at the bottom was so delicious as it was soaked in the doughnut. Great service and such intricate flavors. One of my fave spots in Chicago.
