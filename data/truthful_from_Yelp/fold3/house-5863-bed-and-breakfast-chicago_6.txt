This place was a very pleasant surprise. We had some visitors that we didn't have the space for, so we needed to have them stay here. It was fantastic. The room was large and comfortable; the kitchen area seemed overflowing with a variety of good stuff, including fresh eggs, cereals, treats, etc., etc.; and the front room had a lot of great books and activities. Again, it was such a pleasant surprise and we'll definitely use them again if our home is overflowing with guests.
