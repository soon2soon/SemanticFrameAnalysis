Thanks to Aimee Moore my husband and I had a wonderful time on our weddingmoon at Sandals Grande Riviera in Ocho Rios. Jamaica. The Sandals resort was amazing and having the butler made the experience very enjoyable and romantic.Â  I have been recommending My Island Getaways to all our friends and family and now as we love Sandals/Beaches I am sure you will hear from us in the future. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Erica & Mathieu Maze
