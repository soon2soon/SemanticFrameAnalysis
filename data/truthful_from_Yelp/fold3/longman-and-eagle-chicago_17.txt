Boy oh Boy, where do I start.. How about it being one of the best brunch spots in Chicago, hands down.. Low key, unless it's a Saturday or Sunday morning, then you have to fight lil babies and baby cubs to make sure you get a spot at the bar, but what would a baby be doing at the bar, right?!?!...just go with it ;) Tired my first bloodymary ever at this place and they put everything in it...bacon, cheeses, vodka, and I think I even seen a live chicken floatin' around my glass.. Nonetheless, it's a great spot for some damn good food.
