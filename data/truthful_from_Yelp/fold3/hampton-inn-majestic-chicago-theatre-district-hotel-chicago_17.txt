Was looking for a centrally located hotel within reasonable rates.  The Majestic was perfectly located, the center east side of the the Loop, within easy walking or transit availability to anything you might want to do.  Room was VERY clean (think fresh bedspread/duvets), security was good (door staff and key controlled elevator), concierge was extremely helpful with tickets/tours/transportation, included breakfast was perfect with coffee/fruit/cookies throughout the day.  As a bonus we went to the historical Majestic Theater, which is below the hotel, to see the Book of Morman-was super.
