I stayed at this hotel at the end of a long, frustrating week, and the stay made everything better! Fantastic location right in downtown Chicago near shopping. As soon as you walk in, you will be impressed with the character of this place. It was my birthday, and the hotel staff went all out. I had dinner in the restaurant, which was amazing. Don't be intimidated by the prices- you get 20% off for being a guest. Can't wait to go back!
