This was the best meal I've had in a VEERRRRYY long time! We walked in at 9:30pm thinking there would be no wait, but apparently this place is very popular because there was a 1.5 hour wait. But we ended up grabbing a seat at the bar which was fine. We ordered the fried chicken roulade with duck fat biscuits and the farm burger. HOLY MOLY... Everything was the best I've ever tasted. I could've eaten two more plates full of those. The fried chicken was also delicious with it's siracha creamy sauce. And the burger was one of the best with the most delicious cheese and bacon. I am from out of town so I will tell everyone who visits chicago to go!
