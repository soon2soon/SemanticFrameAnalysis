One of the many reasons I love Hyatt hotels is that they give you toothpaste, one less thing I have to pack! I was getting ready for bed and realized that there wasn't any in my room, so I called the front desk, and was told they would check to see if they had any. 20 min later, to my own impatience, I called again because I was getting tired. I was informed that they were completely out of toothpaste, but had mouthwash. I decided to just call it a night and get the mouthwash in the morning. Two minutes later, someone different called me back, and said that he'd run to the hotel across the street and gotten me some toothpaste. Now that's what I call customer service! Oh, and this particular location has gravy as part of their complimentary breakfast. Thank you for reaffirming why I continue to stay at this chain!
