The staff here really made the experience. From the moment I arrived, until the moment I left, they really made the experience. They were friendly, helpful, and provided excellent recommendations. The hotel was very clean and new. The rooms were spacious with beautifully designed bathrooms. The gym had everything you needed. There were bars and dining located in the hotel. I slept extremely well in their comfortable beds. I look forward to coming back.
