Although I only stayed one night, the stay at Hyatt was memorable.  The front desk guy had an amazing and upbeat attitude.  We were tired from a long drive and he checked us in quickly and answered all our questions. The rooms are not huge, but very decently size with a little small hang out spot with sofa where you could turn it into a bed.  I like how the sink is separated from the shower so that two people do not need to fight in the morning to use the restroom.   The have a pretty big TV and great selections of channels.  My only complaint is that I do not like how one of our bed is facing the mirror, but that's just personal preference. They have a self served AYCE breakfast everyday from 630-930am.  They have Starbucks coffee, fresh fruits, toasts, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, cereal, the list goes on.  I was very glad they provided it because I was way too lazy to drive out and pick up breakfast.  Plus, the variety and quality of the food cannot be beat.  They also have free wifi, and a 24 hours Starbucks, AND a gym (which I wasn't able to use or check out-darn).  I feel like for the price I was paying, this place definitely blew me away.  I am extremely happy with this experience, I encourage everyone to stay here because I will (I will try other locations too)! P.S.  If you do decide to extend your stay with them, ask if they could keep your current rate ( if it is cheaper and the prices are going up).  They usually will accomendate!
