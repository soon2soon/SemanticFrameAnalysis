I really enjoyed the Old Town tour I took. Even having lived in Chicago my entire life and in the neighborhood next to Old Town, I was able to learn things I never knew and see things from a fresh perspective. Our guide was very informative and easy to talk to. I'd highly recommend using Joyce Walks to a friend!
