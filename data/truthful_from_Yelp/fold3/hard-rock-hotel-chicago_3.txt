Can't believe I didn't do a review on this hotel yet...we got a great rate from third party website for the time that we were traveling. We got to the hotel earlier that check in time but they were able to check us in, which was great because we could freshen up before going out to town. The housekeeping crew was great, they lined up our personal bath products in a neat row and tidied up the beds, but what made it really special was the fact that they put my son's stuffed animal in the middle of the bed along with my son's personal blankie...that totally made him so happy :) I was curious about the late check out policy, so I called the front desk, and was surprised to be greeted with Mrs. .... (last name) instead of the generic greeting. The front desk gave me complimentary late check out, which we didn't end up needing but it was appreciated. After check out, they held our luggage too so we could go around town until it was time to go. Very satisfied and definitely recommended.
