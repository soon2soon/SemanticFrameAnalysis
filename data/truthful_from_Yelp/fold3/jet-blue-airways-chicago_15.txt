Go Jet Blue! Another airline that we're happy to have in Chicago! They offer some pretty cheap flights to NY.   I absolutely LOVE the Direct TV & XM radio in the seatbacks.  They are on the minute you sit down in your seat.  I was entertained the entire time and didn't even need my iPod or laptop! Plus, JFK offers FREE WI-FI! So you can can surf the web while you wait for your flight. Hopefully they will eventually build a cool gating area for Chicago.  But I'll take what I can get for now. Also, I love their online flight tracking system.  It's so easy to use and gives a map of where the flight is in the air.  It's kinda neat.
