I stayed here back in early December last month for a conference. The service I received was great. If you sign up to be a Kimpton hotel member for free, you will get $10 free to spend at the bar (I ordered one of their cocktails and with tip it came out to like $5) as well as free internet in your hotel room. They also offered cocktail hour every day I was there in their beautiful lounge, where they offer hot chocolate with elaborate dressings (shaved white chocolate, etc.) and hot apple cider (with the option of adding some rock whiskey for the 21+ folks). The staff was pleasant and great. It was Â breeze to work with them. I enjoyed my hotel room, and the gym is open 24 hours and is clean and has all the necessary equipment you would expect from a nice gym. They also offer free headphones if you need to use them, towels and water. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area.
