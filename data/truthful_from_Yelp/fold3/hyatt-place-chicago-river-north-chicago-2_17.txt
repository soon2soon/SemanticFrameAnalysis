Take advantage and ride the wave of this newly renovated (or maybe newly opened) Hyatt Place. This hotel offers near 5 star quality for a 3 star price. First off, the standard rooms are huge!! The room amenities that stood out the most were the 42 inch Samsung TV, L shaped couch, and the Kohler bathroom fixtures (details matter!). The entire hotel is immaculately clean. The location is also great, next to a handful of excellent restaurants including Roka Akor, just across the street. AND they have free hot breakfast! I will definitely be staying here regardless of whether it is for business or pleasure, next time I'm in Chicago!
