I have used Amanda as my travel agent for all of my trips for about 4 years now. She takes all the hassle of planning a vacation away by making sure every detail of your trip is booked and ready in a timely and organized manner. She has helped me find amazing hotels in Las Vegas and Hawaii for great prices. I highly recommend her to plan your trip! She is a pleasure to work with!
