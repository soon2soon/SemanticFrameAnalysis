As you can see I don't write reviews a lot.  I just really wanted to find a way to thank Jorge for his kindness.   I'm a single mom of two young boys and it takes courage for me to go on vacations.  Jorge made the start of our vacation to Disney truly magical.  I called at the last minute and he showed up the very next early morning right on time at my door.  I ordered a sedan and he brought a SUV just in case sedan was too small and kindly mention that I wasn't being charge for SUV.  He didn't hesitate helping with luggages and was very mindful of sleepy boys not being out in the cold long.  We had pleasant conversation in the car about kids, families, Thanksgiving dinners, etc.  When I got to the airport I realized I didn't have my wallet.  I had my passport and ID with me.  Just no money.  Jorge not only offered me paying on my return trip but also asked if I needed cash!!!  Luckily my sister was with me and was able to pay but I couldn't thank Jorge enough for the kindness he showed.   I'm no longer afraid of vacations!  I've got Jorge!  He made me feel that the world was a better place.   Thank you, Jorge!!! PS.  I'm planning on starting to write reviews regularly and become an active yelper.  Please do not filter this one :)
