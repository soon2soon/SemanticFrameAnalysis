Had a great time last week staying here for one night. I've hosteled through Ireland and parts of California, and this place is by far one of the nicest! They supply you with bath towels! Big Plus! Bedding, room and areas were super clean. Very modern looking and cafeteria was great! Much more offered than the simple corn flakes, toast and coffee/tea. They had muffins, bagels, cheeses and other yummy stuff. I'll definitely will be back! Great place for families too!
