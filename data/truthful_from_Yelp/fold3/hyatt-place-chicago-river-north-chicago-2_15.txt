Stayed here for 6 nights in August 2013.  I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone that is paying out of his or her own pocket.  Brand-spanking new, large rooms, good free breakfast and WiFi, affordable rates (I paid $170/night for 2 queen beds), good location near many 3 and 4 $ restaurants (and some good 2 $ eateries, too), and 2-1/2 blocks to the Red Line station. A couple of cautions: - The hotel is across the street from a fire station.  A few times each night, we heard the sirens from our 11th floor room.  If that would bother you, you might request a room NOT on Illinois St. (but that might not avoid the problem). - There were a lot of families with kids at the hotel, and not many businesspersons.  If that puts you off, you might look elsewhere. - There is no concierge and no room service.  There is a bellhop, but he is stretched thin and not always available.  But, there is a kitchen that you can visit and get food, and a small bar. Nonetheless, I would stay here again (if I were paying the bill, but not otherwise).
