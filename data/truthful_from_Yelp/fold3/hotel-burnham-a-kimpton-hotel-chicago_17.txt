Really nice! Great location at state and Washington, off the craziness of Michigan Â avenue. Coffee in the am and wine in pm. Rooms are smaller-to be expected with an older, historic building. Very nicely furnished and comfortable. Even a yoga mat! The best thing about the hotel is the staff. They are amazing! Anything you want, there were right there. Will absolutely be back!
