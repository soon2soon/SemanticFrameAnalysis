The circumstances of your travel coupled with your expectations play a significant role in how you rate your experience at a hotel. Right? Since I stayed at the Hotel Burnham in August for work in perfectly splendid weather, my experience was exactly what I was looking for. The history screams throughout the hotel from the actual key locks (no key card here) to the old school telephones adorned in the hallways. History blended with modern accommodations is what had me comfortable throughout my stay. Added bonus was the complimentary bike offered in the lobby. Kimpton always has the greatest extras. The locals frequent the restaurant for brunch on the weekends. Windows open, live music - yes and yes please. The location is great - I was close enough to the Palmer House to walk where all of the other fellow conference goers were staying. I enjoyed the extra privacy offered at an amazing boutique hotel - It was perfect. They offer coffee in the morning, wine at happy hour, and both are easy to get to from the elevator. The room was clean and cozy - I slept through the night which almost never happens at hotels. This is my go to place when next in the area. It exceeded all of my expectations.
