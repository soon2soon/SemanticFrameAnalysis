i travel a lot to Chicago for work (at least once a month, but recently up to 2-3 times per month), and every time I stay at Hotel Monaco.  There's not one thing I dislike about it.  Everyone who works here is friendly, the rooms are immaculately clean, and the rewards for Kimpton members are fantastic.  $10 in free mini bar purchases every time you stay, how can you beat that?  Oh, they can beat it, by also offering free wine for an hour every single day and free wi-fi.   There's also free Starbucks coffee and different teas in the morning, and then usually some kind of water infused with lemon or cucumber in the afternoon. My favorite thing about this hotel is that it's right on the river, and if you get a view of the river from your room, you get this awesome little bench that's built into the wall.  You can lay in it and see the river.  It's super comfy with tons of pillows, so I like to lay in it and read a book if I'm not busy that night.  It's really relaxing and beautiful at night, especially if you still have your glass of wine from the wine hour :) These are all of the reasons that I absolutely love the hotel and am bummed when it's occasionally booked.  I've stayed at many other hotels in the area and most don't even compare to Hotel Monaco.  I am a fan of The Trump because it also has beautiful views and is very clean.  However, it's pretty stuffy sometimes while the Monaco is casual and laid back.  The rooms are just completely boring there as well while the Monaco actually has an ambiance and fun decor in their rooms.  Plus, you can't forget all of the perks you get from being an In Touch member for free through Kimpton Hotels.  It makes it that much better to stay at the Monaco!
