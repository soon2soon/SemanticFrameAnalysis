I've been using Home James to get me to and from the airport ever since I had kids around 3 years ago. Having children made it impossible for my spouse to take me to and from the airport. Â I thought they were good back then, but ever since merging with citation limousine more than a year ago they've become a 5 star service. They make it super easy to book a car. I basically just email them (pretty frequently) with my upcoming travel schedule and they email me back a confirmation. Easy peasy! When I land in Chicago I call them to let them know and the always courteous person on the phone let's me know who will be waiting for me and at what door. I've experienced a lot of drivers during my days with Home James they are all fabulous. I probably see Danny the most. He's reliable and a fun conversationalist. Joe is another favorite, but he seems to do more of the early morning pickups and I"ve been trying to avoid 6am flights lately. Before the merger I had the occasional issues (ex: late driver), but now they've completely got their act together. Frequent travels for work can be exhausting and it's nice I never need to worry about my ride to and from the airport.
