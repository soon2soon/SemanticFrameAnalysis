This review is for the Hard Rock Store next to the hotel. The guy there was very nice, helped us with our purchase and talked with us a bit. Great customer service, and some cool items. For souvenirs, or for personal purchases, I recommend you visit this store. It's sad to say but it's not often that you get service like this.
