I haven't taken a trip since I was 20 so it's been 5 years and i've never taken a trip without my family/mom (haha..sad, I know). I was really nervous about attempting to plan a vacation for the first time and it's the first trip my boyfriend and I are taking together! Of course we want it to be perfect. (We've tried planning vacations before but it always fell through since we are indecisive and don't know the first thing about planning trips). The main problem was, we didn't know where we wanted to go, what we wanted to do when we got there, and how to plan transportation. Also, we had just 4 weeks left to plan something since we already turned in our vacation times at work! Alison lead me every step of the way and I didn't have to lift a finger! She's very professional and friendly. She gave us guidance as to which vacation spots we would like since we're looking to just lay out by the beach, drink, and relax. After getting a feel for what my boyfriend and I were looking for, Alison recommended an all-inclusive trip to Riviera Maya, Mexico. After my boyfriend agreed that Riviera Maya would be the perfect place to go, Alison booked it right then and there! Within 5 minutes, our trip was planned. She planned the flight time for us, booked the transportation, our hotel stay, and planned our excursions (we'll be swimming with dolphins)! Whenever we had questions, she was just a phone call away. She even gave us a list of what to pack! I don't know how she did it, but the trip was within our budget. In the beginning I was a nervous-wrack about planning this trip and now that Alison basically did everything for me, I just have to sit back and relax. I cannot believe how easy the whole process was! Thank you Thank you THANK YOU, Alison!
