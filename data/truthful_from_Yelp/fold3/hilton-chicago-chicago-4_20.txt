Loving our stay! 19th floor is unforgettable view.  Govt/mil discount got us $155 for room - very affordable. But $50+ for parking? Ugh!  We are in one of the rooms not updated -- it is lovely!! Clean and classy.  Marble bathroom and soft beds.  Close to ALL the major sights; can walk almost everywhere.
