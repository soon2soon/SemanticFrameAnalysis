Clean, quiet, safe, and cheap. Probably the safest I felt staying in a hostel. Although you may bunk with complete strangers everything is secure (just make sure to buy locks for the lockers). Very quiet and clean rooms. The bathrooms were also not bad either. They offer so much within the hostel coupons on deals to places to visit they gave us a free brochure of fun things to do which we took advantage of. The stay was also extremely cheap compare to the hotels and close to attractions that are a must see while visiting Chicago.
