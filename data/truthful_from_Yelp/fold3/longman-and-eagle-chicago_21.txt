It doesn't look like much on the outside but once you enter it's fantastical. We made the trek from Andersonville to check out this Michelin-starred restaurant to meet a friend for brunch, and it was well worth the drive. Right away the Whole Hog Crepinette with cheese grits and collard greens caught my eye. This southern boy was happier than a possum eatin' a sweet potato. The meal arrived with a nice egg on top and the fresh hot biscuit I added at the last minute. Hog heaven... that's where I was. It was delicious. I can't nitpick about anything. The server kept our glasses filled, she was friendly, and our food came out without much of a wait. Good eats. Good times.
