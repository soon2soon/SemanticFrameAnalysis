Sometimes it is just "the little things" that make all the difference in the world to me, and this JW property understands that.  For example, there was a bit of a mix up with the delivery of an amenity I requested. I traveled that day, then worked a full day and I was tired.  I received a phone call from the manager, and not only did she offer an apology, but she sent up some extra items and credited my Marriott account some points. Some of the floors (I believe the executive floor) have a TV located in the mirror in the bathroom.  It is hard to notice when turned off, as it blends in well with the mirror, so look for a remote!  When getting ready for work I love to have the news on, so this is a really big plus for me. The food and the staff in the executive lounge are both outstanding. There were a number of options in the evenings and for breakfast, even for a vegetarian, and I found the food to be better than what I've enjoyed at other JW properties. The fitness center is huge with state of the art equipment.
