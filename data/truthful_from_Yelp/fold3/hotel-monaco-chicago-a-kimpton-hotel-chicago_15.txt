Perfect location and perfect view! I love my stay here at Hotel Monaco, definitely on the modern side. The bed was comfortable, had an amazing river view room, and helpful staff. We had I believe Caroline helping us at 3 a.m (flight was delayed). Must I say she was amazing, she showed us what trains and bus we can take to go to places and even provided us a map. Not only that, we left a little tip everyday for the lady that cleaned our room and she left us a nice note! What a nice gesture! :) I love this place! If and when I do return my stay would definitely be here! Thanks for the awesome service!
