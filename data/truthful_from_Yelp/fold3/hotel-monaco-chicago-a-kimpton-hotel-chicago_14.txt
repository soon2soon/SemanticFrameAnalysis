Just wow. Perfect location!!  Walking distance to the park (to see The Bean), Navy Pier, Michigan Ave (shopping) and SO MANY great restaurants...plus, who knew, an awesome bar attached! Ok so service all around is exceptional.  From the door man to the bell hop to the check in attendant to the cleaning crew...amazingly friendly and accessible. The room was spacious and had a gorgeous view of the city!!  LOVED the little nook in the window!! The bed was super comfy...had a couch...had the window nook...had an HDTV tv...and if you sign up for the FREE Kimpton Hotels rewards program, you get $10 off of either the mini bar OR the normal bar!  Oh did I mention you get both a zebra print robe (for the guy) and a cheetah print robe (for the girl)...to spend some quality luxurious time. Elevators were speedy, rooms were VERY clean...overall I have ZERO complaints and nothing but praise for this hotel.  It was a perfect experience for the first visit to Chicago!
