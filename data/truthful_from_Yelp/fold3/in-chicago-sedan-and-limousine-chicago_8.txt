Reliable, consistent, professional, respectful, friendly. Nice cars, too. I've been using their service for over a year now for all of our scheduled trips; I prefer them for the safety and comfort of my family. Priced at a reasonable premium over taxicabs but not at outrageous levels like some other ones that make it prohibitively expensive when you are personally picking up the tab (as opposed to your expense account at your company).
