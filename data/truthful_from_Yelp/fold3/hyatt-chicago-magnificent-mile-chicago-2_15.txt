We were in Chicago for a weekend trip and stayed here, what a great hotel and convenient location. The food in the restaurant was delicious, drinks and snacks in the bar were a delight.  We paid for an upgraded room and it was spacious with a beautiful decor.  Great touches and colors, we regretted having to leave the room. The staff is every bit as good as the facilities.  The front desk staff and the wait staff in the restaurant/bar were wonderful, as was the management team who stopped by to chat during our meals. The location is so convenient as well.  Stay here, you will really enjoy your time and there is a Starbucks in the lobby, hotel lobby is on second floor.
