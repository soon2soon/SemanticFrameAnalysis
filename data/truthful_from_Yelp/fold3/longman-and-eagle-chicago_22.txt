High quality food with great management and customer service. Came here with a buddy for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited about 20 minutes for a table. We both ordered the eggs Benedict shortly after sitting. The waitress was personable and checked in on us periodically. However, after ordering a second round of drinks, waiting around, and noticing all the faces at the tables around us had changed, it was evident that out order had been mixed up. The waitress checked with the kitchen, apologized, and told us our food would be out shortly. About 5 minutes later the manager showed up with our food and told us the meal was on the house, as this type of service is not what Longman & Eagle represents. He also made sure to point out that the slip was misplaced in the kitchen and not the waitresses fault. The handling of the situation turned what could have been a 2 or 3 star experience into a 5 star experience. Oh, and the eggs Benedict was top notch! Hollandaise sauce was just right, and a few tweaks were made to the traditional dish to make it stand out. Definitely will return to try some of their other offerings.
