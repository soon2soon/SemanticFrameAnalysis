I absolutely enjoyed my stay @ Hotel felix They allowed me to check in early 11am, staff was friendly & welcoming, i did have a view but the window was small, Â but hey its a view ! my room was clean, bed was comfortable i was on the top floor (12th floor) house keeping was great. you might not want a room near elevator if you are a light sleeper, other then that i really enjoy my stay here (3 nights) ! -location can't get any better -whole foods a block away, many restaurants with in walking distance -excellent costumer service -free wifi 5 stars all the way !
