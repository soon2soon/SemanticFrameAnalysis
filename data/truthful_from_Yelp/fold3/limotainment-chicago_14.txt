Limontainment is AMAZING!!!!! We had another party bus company back out on us last minute, and Mike was able to save the day by booking us a party bus. I am so happy that this happened, because our experience was so much fun from start to finish. The booking process was clear and straightforward. The day of the event the driver arrived exactly when he said he would and was amazing the whole night. He drove us to the museum area and took beautiful photos of the skyline. He was so happy to be there and made our night very memorable! I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend limotainment!
