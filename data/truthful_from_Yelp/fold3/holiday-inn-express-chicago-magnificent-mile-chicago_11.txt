This was a hotel that exceeded all expectations for the price we paid. The rooms were super nice, and very clean, the staff was very friendly. I even misplaced a necklace during my stay there (definitely my own fault) and the staff went above and beyond in helping me try to find it. The free breakfast was an added bonus on top of a great stay- The only con to my stay was how small the rooms were- I definitely didn't expect that. But, for the price, it's completely acceptable.
