I have to say, all the reviews on Yelp regarding to this company is true!!! I book the bus for my wedding on Labor Day Sunday a while back. Michael was great to work with. He was willing to work with our budget and schedule to find the most appropriate bus. The bus was clean, comfortable and must importantly - staying cool for the entire ride. Having a wedding during the summer time in Chicago is not an easy affair, without the AC in the bus, we wouldn't make it through the photo sections and the day. Â  Priest was easy to work with and accommodating. Once again, thanks for making the ride as one of the most memorable part of our big day.
