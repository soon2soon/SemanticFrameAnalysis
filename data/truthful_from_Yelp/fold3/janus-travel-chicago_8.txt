While I have traveled both domestically and internationally for the past decade, I have never used a travel agent before my latest trip. Who needs one when there are so many websites and deals out there?! Well, after searching the internet for weeks looking for a short getaway with my husband, I was about to give up on a trip idea because I couldn't find anything in my price range with direct flights at a decent looking hotel. Then, during a massive snowstorm in January, I remembered that I had bookmarked Janus Travel. I was probably pretty rude when I called because I immediately asked how they were paid, then proceeded to tell them exactly what I wanted and my price range--not willing to budge on a few things including direct flights, all inclusive resort, etc. Not only was Geri so helpful in telling me she was sure she could find exactly what I wanted, she sent me 6 different hotel/flight options within the next 2 hours. The hotels and flights were exactly what I was looking for and a few hundred dollars CHEAPER than I was willing to pay. Best part was that all I had to do was quickly look up the hotels on TripAdvisor.com and pick the right fit for me. She had already taken my flight preferences from our quick phone call into account when choosing Specifics on my trip... 1. Janus Travel did not make me pay for their services. It seems Janus Travel was paid by Apple Vacations but I can't confirm that. 2. Janus Travel booked us a trip through Apple Vacations which was $1,500 cheaper than what it would have cost me to book through Apple Vacation's website. Not sure how that works but I'll take it! I just returned from my vacation and am so pleased with Janus Travel that I'm already trying to think of an excuse to use them again! Thank you so much, Geri!
