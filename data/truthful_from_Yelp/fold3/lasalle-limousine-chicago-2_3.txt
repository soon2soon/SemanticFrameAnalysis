I use Lasalle about 2 times a month, sometimes more.  Always on time or early.  Safe, polite, friendly, professional drivers.  This past Monday (after / during snowstorm that dumped 18 - 20" of snow to the area) my airline flight was surprisingly one of the few flights not cancelled out of O'Hare.  The roads were really, really bad.  Lasalle Limosine got me to O'Hare safe and on time.  After some understandable problems caused by the weather Lasalle picked me up in a large, heavy SUV that could safely handle the conditions.  I highly recommend Lasalle Limosine.
