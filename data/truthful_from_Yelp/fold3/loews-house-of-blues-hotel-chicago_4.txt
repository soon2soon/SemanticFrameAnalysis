HOB is one of my favorite places to stay in Chicago and always has been.  I liked staying there when I was younger because, while it was still a nice hotel, they didn't look down their noses at my boyfriend and I. I've always appreciated the service and I love the bar. The rooms are fun, bigger than most in the city and as an added perk, Bin 36 (yelp.com/biz/u_Ze5HkcNXg…) is right downstairs. It's not the Four Seasons, but it's a lot more fun.
