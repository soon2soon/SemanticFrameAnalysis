I've never used a travel agency when planning a trip, so I was a little nervous, but Liberty Travel couldn't have made the experience easier. Allison was a rockstar explaining our options to us, not only helping us pick a trip that was just right for us, but also getting us a phenomenal deal. She was honest, knowledgeable, and just an overall pleasure to work with. She has also been very responsive and helpful with any additional questions we have had as our trip draws closer. I would definitely recommend coming here to plan your next trip!!!
