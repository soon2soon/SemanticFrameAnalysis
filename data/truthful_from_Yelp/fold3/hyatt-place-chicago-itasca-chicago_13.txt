Pretty sweet digs here at the Hyatt Place. I stayed here after my sister's wedding at the near by Itasca Country Club. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. The rooms are sweet. 46" HD plasmas in every room, awesome blow dryers, very clean, very new and very comfortable. We were an obnoxious wedding party and they didn't seem to mind one bit. They let me check in 2 hrs before regular check in and I was about 20 minutes late checking out and paid NO additional fees. This place deserves 5 stars, but they don't have a real bar in the hotel. They have a serving station that has beer, wine and some cocktails, but I think it closes at 10pm. Because I was so impressed with everything else, I'm going to let that slide.
