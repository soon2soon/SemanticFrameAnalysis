So you are looking for some finer lodging on the north side? Here it is - House 5863, a truly innovative variation (self-titled "hip urban rooms") on the standard doily-filled B & B. My hubby and I had a few guests stay here during our wedding weekend and all were extremely happy with the stay. There is a spacious common living area with a flat screen TV and carefully chosen, modern decor, a nicely planted back deck, a large kitchen stocked with a great selection of complementary drinks and breakfast items, and each room included a comfy robe. The House has only 5 rooms but prices are quite reasonable (small room for 99 dollars) and I am curious about the deluxe suite that occupies the entire bottom floor and sleeps six!
