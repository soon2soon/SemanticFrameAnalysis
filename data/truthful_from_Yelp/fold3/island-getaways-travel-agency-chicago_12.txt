I recently returned from the most wonderful honeymoon in St. Lucia with my wife. I booked this trip with Aimee Moore of Island Getaways and she was FANTASTIC to work with!! When I originally began searching for honeymoon destinations I was speaking with 2-3 different travel agents for comparison; after my conversation with Aimee I knew she was the best possible resource for us. She was very thorough and responsive throughout the 10 months I dealt with her. She made sure to work within our price range and also to provide us with suggestions to make our trip as memorable as possible. I would HIGHLY recommend using Aimee and Island Getaways if you're looking to travel to an exotic and romantic vacation destination.
