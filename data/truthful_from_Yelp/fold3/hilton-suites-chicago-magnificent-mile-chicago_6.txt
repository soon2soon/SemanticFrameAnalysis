I received a good deal with my AAA card and was accommodated wonderfully.  Everything I needed, they had.  Anything I didn't have, they were able to get me--including an additional night because I enjoyed it so much. I was actually skeptical of the rooms based on the pictures but I was pleasantly surprised that the pictures did not do the rooms justice.  The pool, gym, restaurant and bar are all worth visiting as well.
