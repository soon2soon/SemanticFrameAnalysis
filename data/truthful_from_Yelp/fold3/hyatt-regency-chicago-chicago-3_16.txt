Lovely hotel close to The Riverwalk and Michigan Ave. convenient location too! Excellent beds...oh the beds... Missing those! Balloon artist in the lobby on weekends. Easy check in with kiosk or the old fashion way. Free lemon water and cucumber water in the lobby. Great skywalk between the towers with table/chair groupings and bar/stool seating as well as plenty of outlets for charging your devices. No wifi in the rooms unless you want to pay $9.95 an hour, but there is free wifi in the lobby with computers you can use too. Only an $8 can ride to Clarke and State to catch the Blue Line.
