Flew JetBlue first time late June 2010 to NYC. 5 stars is easy: TVs with DirectTV in every seat. You can pretty much channel surf from the moment you sit down to when you get up. Â Genius. I don't like flying very much and the TVs helped big time. Staff was great! Free food and drinks! Overall, PERSONAL TVS=5 stars! Man, that's genius.
