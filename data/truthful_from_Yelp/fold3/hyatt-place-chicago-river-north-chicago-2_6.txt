Huge room with beautiful views, super friendly staff, great location, free wifi, and a breakfast buffet (with actual cooked food, not just toast and cereal) every morning! My only complaint is that, as others have mentioned, the bathroom had a flimsy sliding door that didn't ever fully close. But everything else was great, and I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity.
