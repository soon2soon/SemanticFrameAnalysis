As previously mentioned, I love hotels, I love boutique hotels, and I love pampering myself.  (Maybe I didn't mention all of those, but it's true). What I also love- the macabre...in all shapes and sizes. In the past couple of years, I have become a big fan of the Kimpton chain for a number of reasons- decent prices, great locations, and free wine in the evening.  Oh who I am I kidding, it's the last reason. So when Kimpton emails me and tells me that I'll get a discounted rate for  my birthday month, I strongly consider it.  Granted, I don't have a trip planned...so I plan a staycation in the Loop.  After looking at the other Kimpton hotels, I decided on this one for its quirky elevators and cool vibes, and book it for the weekend of Valentine's day (also Presidents Day weekend this year)....at a GREAT rate.   I go and check in, and they of course know it's for my birthday, and treat me like the special birthday girl that I am with my complimentary champagne and dessert coupon, and discount on the mini bar (which would come in handy later that night).   I travel (via the cool elevators and down the hall past the doors that look like one of them could house an old timey private investigator's office) to room 809.   Which...drumroll please....used to be Al Capone's dentist's office.  Which may or may not sound cool to you, but apparently Dr. Teeth used to also deal drugs out of said office.  I think that's pretty cool. Upon entering my room, I see a cute note from housekeeping along with some roses wishing me a happy birthday and other super nice things.  That's service. The room was perfectly sized, very comfortable, and had a decent view (including the corn cobs).   Although I didn't get a chance to use my free champagne/dessert coupon due to no room in the restaurant, I had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone.
