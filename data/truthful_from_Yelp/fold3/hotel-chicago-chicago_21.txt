Only 3 1/2 stars? Are the people reviewing this place actually staying here? This is my second stay here, this is one of my favorite hotels in the country.  Fantastic modern design and architecture.  Everything is top notch here.  I would love to come stay here on vacation for a week. Love this place.  Fantastic amenities. Comfortable beds. Great shower heads with good pressure.  Big Tvs. 6th floor has a lounge with xbox's and tvs to chill out in. And if this place doesn't get any cooler, they have snake skin chairs.  Where the hell are they finding snakes big enough to make chairs with? Beautiful hotel, wish I could stay here more often.
