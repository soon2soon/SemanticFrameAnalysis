Very Nice hotel! I had to walk dogs here and of course down town CRAP ass parking the Parking attendants let me park my car in the garage, for free. I only had to be there for 15 minutes but to most hotels thats forever to leave your car. the staff was nice and very helpful! the rooms are very nice.
