I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to ride Home James to the airport for business, yet again. My experience was perfect. My driver arrived early, which was probably a good thing since I hate saying goodbye to my kiddos (you know, avoiding the long goodbye). Regardless of him waiting, I didn't feel rushed one minute to hurry up. Â  Pleasant, courteous and gracious. The car was clean and comfy. Small talk was left up to me, though I have no problems chatting it up. I have to say this driver had some amazing skills, because we made one stop to pick up Andrea R on the way, and maneuvering access to her drive was a challenge. I felt safe and completely trusted my driver to take good care of me. I don't know who James is, but I'm okay with him taking me to and from home any time!
