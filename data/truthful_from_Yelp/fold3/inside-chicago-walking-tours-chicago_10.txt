My husband and I visited Chicago recently for vacation and wanted to take a tour where my husband could get some good photos with his new camera. Hilary was awesome and took us inside some really neat buildings. She made sure to point out good photo opportunities and angles which my husband appreciated. She was funny and entertaining which made the tour go by quickly without any awkward pauses. This was a really unique experience and one of our favorite parts of the trip. We liked it so much we wanted to go on one of her other tours but couldn't fit it into our itinerary. Well worth the money!
