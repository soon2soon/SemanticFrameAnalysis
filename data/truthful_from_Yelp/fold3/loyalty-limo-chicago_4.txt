While looking for a limo company for my man's birthday, I came across Loyalty Limo here on Yelp. Initially I found a few companies and called to check rates -- and I have to say, Vince not only was extremely helpful, patient, and courteous over the phone... but he also gave me the best rate out of all the companies I called. On the day of the limo pick-up, Vince text me to inform me who the chauffeur would be, and to give me his contact information. About 10mins before our scheduled pick-up time, our chauffeur, Mr. Dario, was in front of the house waiting patiently (in the cold, I might add) for us, to open the door and provide excellent service. I really appreciated the fact that the heat was on in the limo (I HATE the cold), we had a nice bottle of champagne waiting for us, the music was on... and also Mr. Dario had all the details of where we were headed so I didn't have to go into any details as to where we were going. At the end of the night, I simply text, Mr. Dario (who was "waiting in the wings") was there within 2 seconds of me texting him. Mr. Dario got us home safely even though it was snowing. I would highly recommend Loyalty Limo to anyone!!! Not only are the vehicles immaculate and have exceptional service from the time they pick you up until they drop you off, but their prices are the best! Thank you Vince and Mr. Dario!!!
