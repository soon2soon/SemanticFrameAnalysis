I recently booked a trip with Shavahn. She was incredibly helpful and professional, as were the other ladies in the office that I spoke with. I have traveled quite extensively and I am capable of booking by myself online. What I have found in the past is that when I book online and there is an issue (there is a delay/cancellation, baggage gets lost, or I make a mistake when booking) I am the one who has to try to resolve it and sit on hold with the airlines or Expedia. When I book through a travel agent all of that is taken care of for me. I will continue to book with Liberty Travel and Shavahn.
