Limotainment is run professionally. I suggest it to anyone looking for a party bus or trolley. I have been on all 3 party buses, for bachelor parties, birthday parties, and wedding parties. The buses are always clean, and the driver is always courteous. It's a great way to see Chicago, and I plan on using Mike and his company again.
