I can't say enough good things about Aimee and Island Getaways!  My husband and I have booked several trips to Mexico with Aimee and she has always listened to our vacation needs and offered great advice and options.  Aimee makes herself very accessible for questions before the trip and we were able to reach her easily whenever we needed to during our vacations.  For example, on our last trip we had some issues checking in as the room we received was not what we had reserved.  We called Aimee and she was on the phone right away, she then worked with reservations and the front desk to resolve the situation.  We ended up with a perfect room and some special perks from the resort for the confusion.  It is great to know we can count on Aimee and Island Getaways to make our vacations great! We recommend Island Getaways to our friends all the time and always hear positive reviews from them as well!   Use Island Getaways if you want knowledgable and attentive service!
