I explored Maxwell St & the Saturday market with Joyce as our guide. Joyce was very informative and personable. Her stories brought to light the different incarnations of the area. I would highly recommend a tour with Joyce if you would like a native's perspective of Chicago. She is very knowledgable and passionate about sharing Chicago's history.
