We got a roomblock at the JW Marriott for our wedding last summer at the Willis Tower and were very happy with the level of service and the overall quality of the rooms. They gave us a good rate on an absolutely stunning suite- I mean the bathroom alone was big enough to live in. We used it for the grooms party to get ready which worked out well as it was in the middle of the World Cup and there were huge TVs in the living room and bedroom and even a small tv in the bathroom. Â I ordered room service for lunch and it was extremely quick and no more expensive than room service in any other hotel. When we got back from the wedding there were chocolates and champagne which was a lovely touch. A special shout out to Kristen, the Events Coordinator for being so easy to work with. They were also very kind and accommodating of our guests and were very gracious about letting people check in early to get ready. The only slight issue anyone had was getting service in the lobby bar- but when the managers heard about this they comped their entire bill for a couple drinks and snacks for 4 which to me makes up for it. The lobby is beautiful, we took pictures on the Spiral Staircases leading up to the mezzanine level which turned out awesome. We would definitely recommend the hotel, especially for wedding parties!
