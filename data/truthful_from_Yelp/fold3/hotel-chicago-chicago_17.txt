My wife and I had an excellent stay10/18-10/20. Rooms have a unique style of their own, breakfast at Bin 36 was delicious, and I loved the atmosphere at the Crimson Lounge (get the EnFuego cocktail!) Service was outstanding from Â every staff member, especially Paul Sanders who exemplified professionalism and class. We are already planning our next stay at Hotel Sax!
