My first trip to Chicago and I will be staying here every time! A short distance to the train and free street parking if you drive into town. It's the perfect size with only 5 rooms. The common living area and kitchen are clean, contemporary, well decorated, and very homey. Continental breakfast with a great selection and real food (versus chain hotels). Coffee is freshly brewed and even their dinnerware is nice and clean and you get full access to the stove and microwave. They have a large patio deck outside, and a super cute courtyard downstairs with a grill, nice landscaping, and an intimate atmosphere at night and during the day. Our room was spacious, clean, and cozy. The restroom was also large and clean and had a double vanity. The shower was huge and had a steam room, although I didn't check it out; the only draw back was a low pressure shower head. This will definitely be our go to place every time we go to Chicago.
