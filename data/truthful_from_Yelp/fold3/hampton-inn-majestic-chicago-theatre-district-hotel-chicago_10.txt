It's been a while since I have been here but it still the most comfortable hotel I have ever slept in.  The color and ambience of the rooms just make it so comfortable to sleep and the staff is obviously happy and friendly.  The majestic is the first hotel I recommend to friends and family to stay at in Chicago.
