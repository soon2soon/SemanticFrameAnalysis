We booked Loyalty Limo for our May 10 wedding in Evanston and we had a great day with them. We wanted to make sure to use a local business, rather than some national company or fleet service, and the owner Vince was very helpful via email prior to booking. He even met us on a nasty Sunday morning in January so we could see the stretch Navigator before booking. The limo arrived well in advance of the scheduled time on the day of the wedding, well-stocked with our requested beer list (which comes at no extra cost!). We had a mix of craft beer, cheapo beer, champagne, hard cider and soft drinks and they had no problem stocking up for us. The limo was comfy for our 12-person wedding party and the driver was helpful and courteous. Loyalty Limo's prices are much better than most of the other limo services we looked at, with the added benefit of hands-on service from a local small-business owner. They did a great job all around.
