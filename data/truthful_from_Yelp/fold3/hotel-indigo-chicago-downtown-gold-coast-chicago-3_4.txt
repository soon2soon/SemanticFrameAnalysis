What at great hotel! We stayed here for a mini vacation and we couldn't be happier with the decision! Awesome location, clean and inviting rooms and a friendly staff! The room we stayed in is bright and has 2 bathrooms, that is always a plus when traveling with your boyfriend lol. I'll definitely be coming back for a lil get away. Highly recommend
