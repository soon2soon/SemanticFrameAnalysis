We stayed here in July, to launch my older son off to a 3 week college course.  It was in the heart of everything, a beautiful hotel in a nightlife area.  There is a full concierge approach, and there is not a check in counter, but rather desks.  The concierge-approach check in and check out really works, and the helpfulness and concern of the majority of that staff was impressive. There is a free happy hour. The one drawback is that there is no pool.  Still, it gets five stars because the vibe is just so top-notch.
