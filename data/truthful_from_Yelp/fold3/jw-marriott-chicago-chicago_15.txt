5 five luxury rooms, fantastic service from the clerk Derek to the housekeeping staff. .. Real offerings on tv...Bravo where you can watch uninterrupted movies without paying the ridiculous $25 fee most other hotels charge you for the in room movies... Fabulous soak tubs. .. wow. .. Worth every penny. Next time I travel,  I will opt for jw Marriott and pay the extra $75/night.   Stunning experience
