I had asked a few friends if I should hire a cab or a car service to get to the airport.  Several friends said to get a car service.  I turned to yelp and found In Chicago Car Service.  I called the day before to schedule a ride from the north side of Chicago to O'hare to be picked up at 5:15am.  Jim answered the phone and explained the costs and recommended we leave at 5:15am.  Sure enough, the next morning, he rolled up in front of my building at 5:12am.  3 minutes early!   Jim was very professional, quick, and enjoyable to talk to.  We took a cab home to compare our experience.  The cab was fine and about $20 cheaper, but I would definitely recommend Jim and In Chicago Car Service.  It's worth a little extra money, and you can count on being on time and transported in a professional manner.
