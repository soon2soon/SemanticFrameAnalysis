Came to Chicago for a conference and decided to stay the weekend to visit the local museums and dining seat. The location is perfect for proximity to mass transit and walking distance to Millennium Park and the Chicago Art Institute, plus other parts of downtown. There is an urban Target close by for water and sundry items, plus the usual mix of pharmacies. Didn't get a chance to check out the Mint museum nearby at the Chicago Federal Reserve. Rates are reasonable, room is clean Â and customer service was very good. Definitely worth of return in the future.
