I stayed at HI - Chicago while I was on a recent trip to Chicago in summer. Loved this place, I've always been a fan of hostels and love the experience Price was right about $30-$35 a night! Free breakfast everyday! Everything was very clean. Didn't have a problem at all. All nice people at the hostel and you can't beat the location. Subway was about a block away! The only I disliked was having to swipe my card to get it, swipe card to get into the elevator, swipe my card again on the elevator and then of course into my room, but hey they take security seriously here. Just a little annoying. Will be staying again!
