We can't say enough great things about our Chinatown tour with Joyce.  She knew literally all the historical spots as well as many hidden gems she pointed out to us.  We felt completely comfortable walking around a part of town we didn't know well at all.  We saw tons and tons of different sights we would never have seen on our own. Word of advice:  don't error like me and wear uncomfortable shoes.  You walk a lot! 308/365
