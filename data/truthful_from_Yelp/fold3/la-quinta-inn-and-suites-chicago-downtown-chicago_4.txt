At the end of our days, there is no better spot to return to. The rooms are so beautiful, so authentic, and so artfully decorated. And when morning arrives, we are able to be more leisurely about our preparation for another day in Chicago, IL, thanks to the generously stocked fridge, which makes breakfast so simple!
