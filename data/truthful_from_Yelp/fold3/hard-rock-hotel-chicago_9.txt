Love the hard rock in Chicago the staff recognizes me when I come into town they put me in my room I want everytime I come into town love the bar and the food I have nothing bad to say about this place :) - the staff are awesome helpful not total idiots like at some hotels where you have to ask for a manager to handle whatever your need is rooms are spacious beds are seriously crazy comfy :) very clean! Iv been to hard rocks in the past and won't visit again but Chicago hard rock is very on point and I'm very pleased everytime I come to down the rooms are sound proof I swear I can't hear a thing and iv stayed on 95% full nights :) keep up the good work hard rock
