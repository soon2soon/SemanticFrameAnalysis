It was my first visit to Chicago,  and we were 3 girls flying in to O'Hare at midnight on Thanksgiving.   We were afraid of how to catch a taxi so decided to call a limo service, it's safer was our motivation. So I took to Yelp hours before our flight on Thanksgiving day. Most other Limo companies had unreliable reviews, were booked, or closed. I called Jorge and he said he would call me back and see what he could do. 20 minutes later he called me back and said OK I can do it, and it'll cost you this much including tip. We kept in touch through text on take off and landing, and he was very much on top of us, once we landed he promptly called letting us know the driver was outside and the license plate so we knew which car to approach. The driver was awesome at welcoming us, the vehicle was a large clean SUV and we were quickly laughing and getting trip advice from Hugo. We quickly told Jorge that we wanted to schedule a pick up back to the airport, and he put us down. That Sunday we got picked up by Jorge ' s dad, who was friendly and told us about his family and how the Limo service runs in the family, how proud he is of his kids, and his love for Chicago and Texas. We felt at home. He told us how what Jorge did picking us up last minute on Thanksgiving is rare in the industry and usually only for well known customers, so I highly appreciate everything Jorge did. We loved Chicago, and starting the trip and ending it with Insight Limousine & Sedan was a key to the trips success. Thank you Jorge, Happy New Year, and hope to use you again soon!
