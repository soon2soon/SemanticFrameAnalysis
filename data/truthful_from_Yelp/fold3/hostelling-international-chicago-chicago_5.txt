I cannot find enough positive words to describe this place. Amazing beyond amazing.  Surpassed all my expectations. It is clean, well-organized, staffs are friendly, location is perfect, and so on... they feed you good free breakfast,  they give u good free treats during welcome party(I had popcorn and wine), they offer free hot chocolate and cookies after free guided tour, they give free easter brunch, and etc...... experience it yourself! I highly recommend this hostel.
