I stayed at this hotel via a Hotwire deal for the BlogHer convention. The hotel is connected to the McCormick center and made it extremely accessible to the event. My hotel room was immaculate and perfect for exactly what I needed. I love the modern space and the view of the architecture of the convention center. The hotel elevators run quickly and I barely waited despite having a packed hotel during the weekend. My sink didn't drain and they send someone up immediately to fix it. I had problems with my dinner in one of the restaurants that caused me to get sick and they took it off my bill with no hassle or discussion. I ordered room service and it arrived 15 minutes before their quoted time with everything accurate and great. Of course the room service fees are outrageous but that is completely normal anymore for room delivery. I didn't want to leave my room and I paid for the convenience of having it delivered to my room. They have a healthy food snack area with the Starbucks which is open 24/7 and has tons of gluten free options (which I have celiac disease and this is an additional perk for me). We usually stay at Marriott and they are seriously lacking behind the times with gluten free items for their guests. The cabs were plentiful and I never had to wait for one the entire 4 days during my trip. The hotel is far from downtown so expect a $9 cab fare to get to Michigan Ave shopping. Overall, I am very impressed with the hotel and would stay here any time again in the future.
