Nice looking room with plenty of space. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was large. I wish they had a regular shower instead of the shower/tub combo, but that's a very minor gripe. The room we had included a mini refrigerator which is nice when you need to keep your Chicago deep dish pizza fresh for the next morning. We walked and took cabs everywhere around the city which was much cheaper than renting a car and looking for spaces around town. We at the room service breakfast. Yes, its super pricey and we only did it due to being short on time. The food was alright, served nice and hot and on time. If you have a little more time, there is a doughnut shop on the corner of the block and a place called "West Egg" a block away that are both pretty good. We had to print some show tickets that I forgot to bring and it was nice to find out that was all free. You get 30 minutes of free internet time at the business center and the 2 black and white pages we printed were free. This is a very nice touch and is unlike many of the places we stay. In room internet was a decent speed. Location is key for this hotel. Yes, its nice decor, but you are really paying for the close proximity to everything. Overall I was satisfied and would return.
