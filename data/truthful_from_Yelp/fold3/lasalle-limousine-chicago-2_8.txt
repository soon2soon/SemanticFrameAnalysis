I needed a car service last minute from the city to pick up a colleague and go to client meetings and two airports.  Phone reservations were responsive, covered everything and sent a confirmation email.  Milan, our driver, was there on time, and a true pleasure and efficient throughout the entire experience.  He found ways to use highways and side roads to minimize traffic impact that I never would have if I had rented a car instead.  The $55/hr plus tip was well worth it, especially as I was able to make an earlier flight because of Milan.
