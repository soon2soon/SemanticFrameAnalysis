I just stayed at the Hyatt this past weekend with 3 other friends and it was AWESOME!!!  I got a really good deal through Hotwire.  The hotel is conveniently located about 2 minutes from the Magnificent Mile.  I loved that we could walk to most places from the hotel and if not, we got a cab really easily.  There's a Starbucks in the hotel, so that's super nice.  The rooms are newly renovated, all the staff was nice, and the hotel gives awesome toiletries.  This is the first hotel I've stayed at that gives out travel size toothpaste, how awesome is that?  We kept asking for more towels and toiletries, and they delivered (in a cute little bag) right away.  The free coffee and tea inside the room is also Starbucks.  The beds are comfortable.  Super clean.  There's also a cute dining area and bar, but we didn't go.  There was too much to do in Chicago!
