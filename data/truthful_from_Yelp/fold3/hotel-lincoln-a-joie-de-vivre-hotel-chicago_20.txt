Hip- not snobby, historic hotel overlooking Lincoln park and the lake. Friendly employees, casual creative tasteful vintage decorations throughout. Indoor outdoor rooftop lounge with city and park views. Dogs allowed. Great new coffee shop in lobby. Sewer gas odor from bathroom drains not uncommon in an old structure with old plumbing. Very short walk to Twin Anchors historic restaurant, old town historic homes, and lakefront. Clark street bus out front and easy taxi hail. Â I highly recommend this hotel to young at heart visitors and locals with cool taste. A fair rate considering all this hotel has to offer. I'm a local, but will definitely be back.
