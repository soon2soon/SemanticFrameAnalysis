Love, love, love, loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this place!!! This hotel was totally modern-sheik, SO CUTE! I got a great deal for about $80 a night, which is seriously unheard of, and stayed here! The room was absolutely adorable - and HUGE!!! The decorations were clean, modern, and sophisticated. I would seriously decorate my house like this hotel. Love. I can't say enough about the way this place looked. Everyone from the outdoor staff to the front desk were more than helpful, they went above and beyond even though the hotel was booked solid! The bar in the lobby, Crimson Lounge, was super trendy, it was decorated in a dark romantic swanky feel and actually turned into a club on the weekend night, which was unexpected but LOVED! We had such a great time there that night! I will definitely be back!
