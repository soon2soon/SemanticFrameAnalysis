This place is awesome! We were here for 3 nights, and I think we paid only about 238 dollars.  The hotel offers free breakfast, free wifi, and exemplary customer service.  Room service is also very commendable.  We left huge messes every time, and our room was spotless when we came back at night.  Seriously, they have great room service.  They also have a 24 hour food room service if you have the midnight cravings.  I'd stay here again.
