I had a great experience with Loyalty Limo. I needed a limo for my best friend's bachelorette party and was not disappointed. At the time of booking, I spoke with Vince and he answered all my questions and was very friendly. I received an email confirmation right away with all the details. The week of the party, I received multiple communications from them by email and phone to confirm itinerary, addresses and other details. On the day of the party, I received a text with our driver's name and cell number. Her name was Desiree and she was AWESOME; so friendly and at our service completely. A true professional in all aspects. She arrived on time for each pick up and accommodated us on last minute changes with no problem. She also cruised around after we left the bar so that we could enjoy some time just having fun in the limo. Speaking of the limo, it was BEAUTIFUL. It was clean and classy and fully stocked with 2 bottles of champagne, spotlessly clean champagne glasses (enough for everyone), bottled water, beer, and pop. The sound and lighting systems were at our disposal and worked perfectly. My only suggestion for improvement would be their phones. I spoke with Natalia multiple times to confirm detail changes and such(also very friendly to speak with), but every time she left a message or I spoke with her directly, the line was muffled and I could hardly hear/understand her. I think I could probably only understand about half of every message she left for me. Despite this minor detail, I have NO complaints about anything! Overall an amazing experience and would use Loyalty Limo again in a heartbeat!
