Super awesome!  Loved it!  Got to meet people from around the world.  Reminds me of my college dorm years ago.  Several years ago, I came here and it was bad.  My food got stolen in the fridge even though I put my initials on it.  Fast forward to now.  Security is much much better.  You have to swipe your room card for just about everything (elevators to getting to your room).  Love that feature!  The only thing that I wished I brought was ear plugs.  Beware of people snoring if you are a light sleeper like me.  Bring your own lock & key though.  If you have a later flight, you can store your stuff in the lockers near the front desk after you check out.  Also, when you check in ask for a lower bunk if you have bad knees like me.
