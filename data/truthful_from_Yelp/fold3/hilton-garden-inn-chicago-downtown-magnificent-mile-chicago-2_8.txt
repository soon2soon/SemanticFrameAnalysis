I'll get this over with fast: 1.  Great room for the money, with the special deal I had offering free valet with in-out privileges for $179 a night. 2.  Valet parking allows you to call for your car with a text.  You will have it within seven minutes of texting for it.  Normally I loathe valet as it is a horrible inconvenience but these folks did it right so no storm of anger from me this time. 3.  A clean and accommodating room.   4.  Desk and valet staff that was very friendly and helpful.   5.  Very good fitness room with weights and a cable machine. My HGI of choice in the city.
