Great Chicago hotel example of the "modern" era. We drove here from St. Louis because of air traffic issues and that worked out great. All staff were friendly, unintrusive, genuine. Our check in was smooth, accurate and very quick allowing us to catch transportation to McCormack Canter for our conferences. On our return to the hotel from our conference, we saddled up to the lobby bar which was comfortable, welcoming, and efficient. We ordered a beer before going up to our room to prepare for dinner. Our room was of a decent size, clean modern just as you would expect. I like the idea of this level of hotel doing away with bed spreads. Sheets, blankets on the bed, ready to Â roll. After dinner, our group of 12 came back the the hotel and this time we went to The Big Bar on the 2nd floor. It's called the Big Bar because it is a big bar. Imagine that! As you would expect, the prices are not Motel-6 or Red Roof Inn level. Parking our car for 1 night was $50.00, wow. Taxes were over $35/day. Wow. But, this is Chicago and not Ottumwa, Iowa. Pricey but what can you do about it?
