Great little hotel!  The price was so reasonable for a last minute booking and the rooms are huge!!  The beds are comfortable and it doesn't feel stuffy like most hotels that only cost around 80 dollars a night.  Plus you get an awesome breakfast for the price!  Only downfall is that I wish breakfast went a little later than 9:30AM but hey, it was free, so I can't complain.   I'll be staying here again for sure!
