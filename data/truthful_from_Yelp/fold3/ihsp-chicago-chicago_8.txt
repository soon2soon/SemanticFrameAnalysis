My boyfriend and I stay here quite frequently and it is freaking awesome! the rooms are very nice and uniquely furnished. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and helpful on great places to go. It is located in an amazing area by tons of restaurants and bars. The blue line is one block away and the bus which drops you off at the metra station is 10 feet away. The Walgreens next door is by far the nicest one that I have ever been to. They have all you can eat pancakes. As long as you reserve your parking space early, it is free and in a safe lot located behind their second building. We have stayed in both buildings, and they are both out of this world. This is by far the best hostel in Chicago!
