This place rocks! Came in during one of their 5-6 p.m. wine happy hours and thought we walked into either a snazzy bar or upbeat wedding reception. Lots of dogs because there was a fundraiser at the dog shelter down the street. Front the doorman, Pierre, to the front desk rep, Jennifer, I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Cleaning persons were ultra nice. Never have I felt more welcomed in a hotel. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Whatever management is doing to keep these people happy, keep it up! Rooms and views were great, the iced water, tea and hot cocoa were always available, and the location can not be beat.
