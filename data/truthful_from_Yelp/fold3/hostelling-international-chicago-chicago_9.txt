I've stayed in a handful of hostels in Europe but this was my first American hostel experience. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable, and we're almost always a delight to talk to. The hostel was impeccably clean, and the beds were the most comfy I've experienced in the hostel category. 24/7 free coffee and tea was a nice perk, especially if you're there for work rather than exploring. The complimentary breakfast was really good and had a lot of variety which was a nice surprise as well. I recommend bringing your own padlock as they don't provide them and the lockers in the rooms do not lock on their own. 5/5 would stay there again.
