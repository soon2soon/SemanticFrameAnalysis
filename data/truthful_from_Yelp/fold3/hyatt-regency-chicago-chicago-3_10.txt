Yay, Hyatt! I stayed here last weekend for a jaunt in Chicago, and had nary a complaint. I found a great deal on Priceline, and for a mere pittance, I upgraded to a city view room with a floor-to-ceiling window -- a great thing to wake up to. This is a ginormous hotel that gives you a bit of an airport vibe, so if you're looking for an intimate boutique experience, keep swimming. However, staff was cheerful, courteous, and friendly (props to check-in staffer with the unusual name beginning with an L, who was a delight), and did a great job of attending to me. My only complaint was the day of check out. Due to a late night/early morning gallivanting around, I requested a late check out. Unfortunately, about thirty minutes prior to leaving,  housekeeping decided to trounce in my room unannounced, and got an eyefull. Woe betide! Thanks again to the great front desk staff who made sure to remedy the issue when I brought it to her attention, and also comp'ed my room service for the weekend, as an apologetic gesture. Good on ya,  Hyatt.
