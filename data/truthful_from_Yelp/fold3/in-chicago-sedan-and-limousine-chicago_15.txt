Thank you for getting our event's speaker in to Chicago safe and sound--we would have had 500 really disappointed executives if you didn't! She was pleased with the service, and we were pleased that In Chicago Car Service was more reasonably priced than the car service we used for the out-of-state portion of our speaker's journey.
