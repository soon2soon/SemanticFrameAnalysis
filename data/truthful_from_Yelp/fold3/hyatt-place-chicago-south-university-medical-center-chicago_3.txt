I stayed here back in December 2014.  As soon as I got there it was simple to find, but there was no free parking so i had to do Valet parking for $35 a night. I had a voucher that i won at my job for a free night at any hyatt place or hyatt house for a 1 bed suite with an expiration date of april 2015 in which i used. Keep in mind that i got there 7 hours before check in - i had an early flight and the gentleman at the front desk (i think he was the manager - he was african american - very sweet) he was a rockstar - he was able to book the last room he had and i didnt have to pay extra at all. He didnt give me a hard time either - such an easy check in. All the other staff were sweet too. ROOM   The bedroom was very nice, it was clean and i had a cool view.  Hotel had free breakfast - and the beds were soo comfortable. Lots of storage space to put your clothes. The bathrooms were sooo nice. All new and it was luxury. There was no kitchen but there was a nice size fridge and  table to sit and eat and there was a sectional couch in the corner to sit and watch tv - tv was mounted on the wall but i was able to adjust it  which was so cool and was able to watch from either side of the room. Location Location was great, everything was walking distance. There was lots of restaurants nearby and also a bar - a smoothie spot - chipotle - etc. There was 24 -hour security that walked around the hotel and also always a valet gentleman outside the front - all so sweet and i felt safe there. SERVICE The manager was very accommodating i cant thank him enough. The service i received was pleasant, i had a wonderful experience. I will definitely refer all my friends and family here in the future.
