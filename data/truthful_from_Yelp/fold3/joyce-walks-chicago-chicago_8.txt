What a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon!  I discovered Joyce Walks Chicago (great name, by the way!) through a Google search.  Not only does Joyce know her stuff, she is funny, animated, captivating and an all-around joy to tour with.  Her love of all things Chicago shines through.  While you'll learn a lot on this tour, you'll also be entertained. Make sure you ask her about the Navy Seal hostage situation!
