Booked this hotel through Priceline.com. First time staying and love it. Room was clean and looked well maintained. All the staff that we interacted with were more than helpful and very polite. The young lady that checked us in was able to give us some information regarding parking at a concert we were attending that evening. Had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It was a little on the pricey side but it was a buffet so you could eat as much as you like. View from our room was of the parking lot for the nearby convention center, but the views from other parts of the building were spectacular. Overall very nice hotel, would stay again.
