Stopped by here on a Friday night and was seated in 10 minutes. (WAIT! I didn't finish my drink at the bar, but I was able to bring it to the table.) Definitely doesn't feel like a Michelin star restaurant, but reflective of my experience at Dusek @ Pilsen. Same crowd and chillaxing atmosphere. The table consensus of the food was that it was delicious and the "will-come again" feedback. We had ordered the bone marrow, burger, beef tartare, etc. The beef tartare is a $15 deconstructed, mini "Big Mac." However, the terrine chocolate ganache was the star of the night. Great flavors, not too sweet, and great presentation. Â If you plan on making a stop here, don't skimp on the dessert.
