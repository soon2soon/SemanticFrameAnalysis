My family and I stayed at the JW Marriott over Labor Day Weekend. The hotel is strikingly impressive from the moment you walk into the lobby. All staff were extremely professional and friendly. The room was very comfortable - great beds, new big-screen TV, free wireless, very large bathroom with separate tub and shower. The Florentine restaurant is elegant but kid-friendly. We had breakfast with a large group and everyone really enjoyed their food. We did not use the gym but did check it out. Spacious with lots of machines and free weights, a dedicated stretching/yoga/class room and a small but nice indoor pool. Lots of cardio machines with integrated TVs as well. This is a fantastic hotel and we will definitely stay there again when we're back in Chicago.
