Great decor, service, location, and food. The room was cozy, clean, air was fresh, my view was good, the amenities great. I had asked (and was delivered to) a yoga bag. I also asked for a flat iron and that came in about 5 minutes. Make sure to register as a Kimpton hotel member beforehand so you take advantage of the free wifi. Also make sure to take advantage of the wine reception (good wine, not your Embassy Suites cheapo one) and to try the Atwood cafe. I had lunch there with a couple of friends and we were all very satisfied with the food quality. The hotel is also dog-friendly. Hopefully other Kimpton hotels are similar to this!
