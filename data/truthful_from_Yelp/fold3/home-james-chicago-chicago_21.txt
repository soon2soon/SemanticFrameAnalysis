Sal, the owner, was my driver for my O'Hare run into downtown Chicago and back two days later. Online reservations were a breeze - Sal's wife, Liz, handles those nimbly and proactively. Car was clean, service impeccable. Had snack bars and water if the need arose. A/C worked beautifully. Sal was on-time, right when & where he said he'd be. I've found my "go to" limo service for Chicago-land, Chicago.
