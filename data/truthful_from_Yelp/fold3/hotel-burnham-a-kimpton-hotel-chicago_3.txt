This is an incredible hotel to stay at especially if you are running the Chicago Marathon. Our room had a view of the lake and of the Chicago Theater down the street. The staff was endlessly friendly and accommodating. They truly went above and beyond.The morning of the marathon they amenities at the hotel were incredible. They put out typical runner fuel (hard boiled eggs, bagels, oranges, bananas, gatorade, etc.) and greeted runners happily in the morning. I also had a great breakfast at the Atwood Cafe in the hotel. Highly recommend.
