Back in December, I was trying to book a European river cruise on line. I soon found myself in over my head, so I decided to book the trip through a travel agent. After seeing all of the great reviews on yelp, I gave Liberty Travel a try. All the glowing recommendations were accurate. Alison was amazing. She patiently explained all of my possible choices and I never felt like I was being steered to option or another. She even saved me $500 on airfare. I wish that every business I have to deal with was as good as Alison and Liberty Travel. Highly recommended
