I recently booked a trip to Europe with two friends at liberty travel and could not say enough good things about Alison Vargas who helped us book our trip. She was everything you could want Â in a travel agent; extremely knowledgable, honest, enthusiastic, and easy to get a hold of and communicate with throughout our planning process. You can tell she truly has a passion for travel and is very friendly and helpful! We were very indecisive about what we wanted our travel plans to be and she was able to adjust to our everchanging trip itinerary with ease. I only wish she could come with us on our trip!! I would highly recommend her for any travel needs!
