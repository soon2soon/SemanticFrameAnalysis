My boyfriend's Mom was visiting last weekend and we wanted to do something active and learn a little more about the city!  We met Paula and learned so much about U Chicago's historical buildings and early origins and then went through the Washington Park complex.  Great times; great tour!  Highly recommended from us Michigan folk!
