Could not have asked for a better getaway location.  Clean, large, comfortable rooms.  Love there is a separate bedroom.  Excellent service on all fronts.  Complimentary breakfast and dinner (with beer and wine).  Wireless included, free paper, in room coffee (full kitchen). Nice pool and workout room.  Something for everyone, overall a great place to stay with kids. The location was great too!
