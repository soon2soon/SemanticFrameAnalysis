Over the past 3 years, we've hosted two major events at the Hotel Sax, and I've also attended various events as well. As a conference venue, they do what I'd consider to be an above average job in setting up, and the facilities themselves are more interesting than your average hotel.  The level of branding we were able to pull off at the hotel was quite impressive in every way. The hotel is a nice size. It's not exactly small and boutique, but it's not large and corporate either.  It's very much a full service hotel in terms of facilities, yet maintains a smaller, personal feel. My real applause goes out to their IT director who goes by simply "O" ...  From an IT perspective, three years ago we were not as impressed with the options given. This year, it seems they have gotten a new IT director and he's exceptional. I e-mailed with "O" several times, and he did a better job at project management of the IT services we needed for our event than we did. We ordered some special services from AT&T and not only did he meet them at time of setup, he actually configured the devices, tested them, and put everything together into a Word document and sent it to us. I expected to do that portion but he was done with it before I even knew AT&T was completed.  Really fantastic, above and beyond service.
