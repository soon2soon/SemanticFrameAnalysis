We did a Chinatown tour with Joyce Walks Chicago. What a great way to spend an afternoon. Joyce is so much fun...so animated and engaging and knowledgeable. She is friendly, approachable (not stuffy like many tour guides) and obviously enjoys what she does. We will definitely being taking more Joyce Walks Chicago Tours.
