I want to preface this review by stating that I do love the Kimpton Hotels and try to stay with them when I can. I also try to stay at a different one each time if a certain city has multiple locations. I had planned a trip with my two sisters in order to celebrate my baby sister's birthday at the end of November because she had never been to Chicago and we were not disappointed. I had never stayed at the Hotel Burnham and it lives up to all of the reviews. Historic and lovely with great access to Millenium Park and the south end of Michigan Ave. The staff was also very welcoming. What really made the front desk wonderful is that they asked why we were visiting and I shared the fact that it was a birthday gift for my sister. We left the hotel to tour the city and when we came back that night we had three cupcakes waiting in our room with a lovely birthday message from Gretchen. Shout out to Gretchen for being great! Overall 5 star experience. Thanks again Kimpton!
