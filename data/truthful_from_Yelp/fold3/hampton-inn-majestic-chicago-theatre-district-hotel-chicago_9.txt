We stayed here for a quick trip to Chicago, and it was a great choice. This hotel is very close to shopping, museums, attractions, and train stations. The room was clean and modern, and provided ample room for the two of us. One huge plus was that it was quiet. I never heard any other guests or street noise during our stay. The front desk was very helpful and courteous, and they made us feel welcome from the minute we arrived. This hotel is definitely one I'd recommend to anyone going to Chicago.
