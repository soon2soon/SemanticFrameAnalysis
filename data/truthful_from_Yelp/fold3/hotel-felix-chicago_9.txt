Just went in vacation earlier this week!  I had an amazing experience and honestly from the minute I walked in I was treated very well by the staff.  After reading the posts on here I chose to ask for an upgrade to a larger room and lucky for me they had one available!  I even chose to have a spa day when I arrived and I can't begin to tell you what an amazing experience that was!!!  The location was perfect!!!  Walking distance to most places.  Thank you very much Felix Hotel!!!
