Let me start by saying how picky I can be about hotels. This hotel is spectacular!! Location location location!! It is right in the heart of downtown close to everything including michigan ave for shopping! Â  Now the more important stuff. I must say I have never stayed at a hotel where everyone went above and beyond to make you fee welcome and right at home. From Erika at the front desk to I believe it was Sierra at concierge to the most amazing two doormen in the lobby Antonio and Michael. I truly can't mention enough how amazing these two are. Very helpful in helping you find anything from a restaurant to parking lots that are close and below average!! They stand out in this cold but their personalities and politeness warm you up like the cups of hot chocolate the hotel provides. I honesty am coming back to this hotel for the people that work here. An amazing hotel and on top of all that amazing service the rooms are huge. They are very clean and housekeeping deserves the credit. Can't wait to come back with my lady and that's the truth. Wish the Kimpton hotel Monaco a great and prosperous 2015!!!! FK
