Excellent location, wonderful service, large rooms and free wifi! I am very pleased with this hotel and will be returning.  The staff were so incredibly friendly and welcoming.  Yes, there is a fire station next door.  However this is the city and you will hear sirens all night at any of the hotels.  It is part of the experience.  This is the only hotel I have stayed in downtown that provided earplugs, a nice touch. You can walk to everything and all your needs as an be met within two blocks. Well done!
