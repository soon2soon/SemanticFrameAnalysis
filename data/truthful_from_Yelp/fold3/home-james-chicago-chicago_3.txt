My wife and I used Home James for our quick trip to Chicago.  Both the pick up and drop off at the airport were top notch.  The vehicles were clean and comfortable and everything was taken care of with a quick email.  The drivers were great and I especially liked the fact that everything including the tip was taken care of prior to the pick up. Great company!
