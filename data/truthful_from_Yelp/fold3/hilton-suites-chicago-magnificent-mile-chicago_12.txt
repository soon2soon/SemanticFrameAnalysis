Fast and easy check in. Valet service with unlimited in and out. Nice and clean suite with nice view of the city. Â Best part was it was located close to Michigan Avenue... walking distance to shopping and food! We didn't have to take the car out or a taxi to go anywhere. Close to downtown and affordable compared to other hotels in the area.
