OK, I'm not a B&B person, which may be why I liked House 5863 A LOT! First, I did not have to interact with any owners. Second, there was no potpourri in sight. Third, the self check-in worked perfectly. Fourth, the room was great and well worth the money (not cheap, but a wonderful location). Fifth, I didn't have to interact with anyone at breakfast--I could fix my own eggs, toast, etc. I'll admit that the Folgers was not the best part of waking up, and they could have had milk and half and half in the fridge instead of just milk. Sixth, wait, why would you possibly want a B&B breakfast when Clark Ave. is full of great places and, sorry, if you are in Chicago and staying at an upscale B&B, you really don't have to eat Fruit Loops. However, spring for some good coffee. Even Mrs. Olson quit drinking Folgers...she changed to Stumptown from Portland (full disclosure, I'm from Stumptown). House 5863 is a great place to stay. Go for room #4--the direct access to the deck is wonderful. One caveat. You have to climb about 15 steps or so--the rooms are on the second floor. So, if you have a ton of stuff, or if you aren't up to carrying your bags upstairs, this is not the place for you.
