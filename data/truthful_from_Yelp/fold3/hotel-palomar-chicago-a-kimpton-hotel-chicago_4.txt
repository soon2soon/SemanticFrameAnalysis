This is my 2nd Kimpton hotel I've stayed at. First one was in Washington DC. After this stay, Kimpton hotels are definitely my first choice of hotel wherever I visit. The modernized look of the boutique hotel, the service and locations are a great combination of what makes the Kimpton hotels great to stay at. Hotel Palomar is so conveniently located in downtown Chicago. You feel safe walking around here. Couple of steps away and you'll find yourself at the subway for easy travel. If you walk about 15 mins, you're already in the Loop to shop around or you can just take the subway and it'll be the next stop via the Red Line. Shopping and great restaurants are all conveniently located just minutes away walking which means you can save your money by not having to rent a car. Traditional style hotel rooms though the one in DC was bigger than the one here. Not complaining though since it's enough for two people. Clean and great service here. Requested a Keurig machine free of charge. They let us do a late checkout since we had a late flight back to LA. Though the only thing about the Kimptons is that if you don't book through them, you won't get the benefits of being a Kimpton member. Only thing is free wi-fi which is enough for me so make sure you sign up for their rewards to get free wi-fi.
