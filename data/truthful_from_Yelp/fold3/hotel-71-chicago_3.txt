Great hotel in a central location.  Get the same view as those staying in Trump International Hotel, but for a fraction of the price. Hotel 71 is a boutique style hotel that has modern interiors with pretty decently sized rooms.  The staff is super friendly and, if you request an upgrade to your room, you may be able to get one if the hotel isn't overbooked at the time. I recommend staying in one of the River View rooms over the City View Rooms.  The river view looks out over the Chicago River and Marina Towers to give you a quintessential Chicago view that you can't find anywhere else.  The city view rooms aren't bad either.   You can usually find deals for this hotel on Hotwire, Orbitz, Expedia or one of those sites.  I've stayed here a couple of times for events, and have never spent more than $100 for a room. The staff is extremely friendly and the concierge will help you with any extra accommodations that you may need.  I've posted some pictures of the views from my room to the picture section, so hopefully that will help in making your decision. TWO BULLET RECAPS: :::::LOCATION::::: -Smack in the middle of the city and walking distance to shopping/restaurants -Close to the L and various buses :::::AMENITIES::::: -Spacious Rooms with amazing views -Restaurant and lounge downstairs :::::SERVICE::::: -Staff is very friendly and accommodating -Very helpful in giving you dining/tourist advice :::::INTERESTING FACT::::: -They shot scenes for The Dark Knight here (Bruce Wayne's Penthouse) -They shot scenes for Showtime's Shameless here.
