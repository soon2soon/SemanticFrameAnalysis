Great hotel and great stay!! Staff was very good and everyone is very friendly. Staff in the Executive Lounge was excellent.  Best breakfast in a lounge ever.  Tons of selection and great snacks during day and night. Room was amazing.  Huge with tall ceilings and big windows.  Bathroom was huge as well with a very deep relexing tub and two sinks.  Also, the room darkening curtains were the best I have ever had.  Would love these for my house.  At 9am it felt like it was 4am.  I could've slept for days.  Made the stay that much more relaxing.  And with the double pane windows, didn't hear a sound outside. Overall would love to stay here again.
