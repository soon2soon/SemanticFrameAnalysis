My friends and I had a great experience at this hotel. We arrived a few hours before our check-in time.  The staff offered to store our luggage and call me when the room was ready.   The room was clean and tastefully decorated.  There was plenty of room for all five of us. The free breakfast had many options.  There was a variety of hot items (scrambled eggs, french toast, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal) and cold items (fruit, cereal, donuts). We were all pleased with our visit here.
