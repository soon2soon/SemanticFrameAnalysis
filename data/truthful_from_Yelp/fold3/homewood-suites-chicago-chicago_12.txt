To everyone who wants a nice comfy stay in the heart of the city for a great price, stay here! This place kicks booty. Seriously! Definitely a must-stay if you want to stay in the heart of the city, soak in the great sites of Chicago, and save money on cab fare. (Trust me, you do not save money by rooming somewhere outside the city. Saving $60 a night on a hotel 30 min outside the city quickly builds up to $100+ fees per day through commuting by taxi. Curse you, Hotwire!) First of all, our room wasn't ready and the concierge holds your things in a secured area the entire day and it only costs a mere tip for their services. So we arrived about 10 am, had them hold our things until we finally checked into our room about 10 pm. The next day, we checked out, but decided to stay in the city for some sightseeing. They came to our rescue by holding our things after we checked out until we were ready to leave the city about 9:30pm that day. I gave them $20 tip for their services. They definitely deserved it! All service was extremely friendly and accomodating, our room was nice and roomy (separate area for the living room/kitchen and bedroom/bathroom) and had a spectacular view of the city! In the morning, they have a free hot breakfast buffet. And if you want swimming with a view, the top floor has a pool.
