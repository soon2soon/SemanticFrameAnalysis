Dominick Vincent is fantastic to work with. I used him to book my 30th Birthday Celebration at Disney World. Since I had never used a TA before, I had tons of questions. Dominick made the process so simple. His excitement about my trip made me even more excited than I already was. I am so thankful for his guidance, because it was the best vacation I have ever had. I also couldn't believe how much money he helped me save, the trip was way less than I had imagined. It allowed us to have extra spending money at the parks. I will be using Dominick for every Vacation I go on. His passion for customers, and for his job shines brightly! Thank you Dominick, for helping me create some amazing memories that I will never forget.
