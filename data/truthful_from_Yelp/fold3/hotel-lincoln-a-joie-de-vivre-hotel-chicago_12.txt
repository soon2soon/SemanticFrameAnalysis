Hotel Lincoln is as good as it gets. It's appealing as soon as you enter; the staff is delightful. My single room was plush. The coffeehouse off the lobby was reasonably priced with great coffee and fabulous food. The restaurant was terrific. But best of all, when I foolishly left items behind, they collected them and sent them to me promptly. I couldn't have asked for more.
