Just Sailing is the BEST way to see the city, enjoy an afternoon, and relax with friends.  I've been lucky to get to know Captain Justin through setting sail on his beautiful boat, High Life.  Captain Justin is not only friendly and fun, he's professional and relaxed.  He made me feel welcome and at ease the moment I stepped on the boat, allowing me to kick my feet back and enjoy the view of the city. Sailing on Lake Michigan off the coast of Chicago is the perfect place to enjoy the city without being in the city!  The city noise and smells disappear as you drift away from the shore.  You will be amazed how beautiful the city is from this view.  You will have pictures to show your friends, for sure.   If you have the chance, on a visit to Chicago or as a resident, take an afternoon and Just Sail!
