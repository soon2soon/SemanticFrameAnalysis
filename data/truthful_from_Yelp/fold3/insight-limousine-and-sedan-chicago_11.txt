My mother used their services and has been ranting and raving about them. Here's what she said: "We used Insight Limo for the first time Friday July 6th.  The owner Jorge was great.  From the first phone call to make reservations to the time he dropped us off at the end of the night he was very  very  professional. His limo was very clean and well stocked inside.  He picked us up to take us to a concert, which he knew was a surprise for my husbands birthday. Not only was he on time, but he was playing the music of the concert we were going to.  It was a great start to a fantastic evening. I would highly recommend Jorge and Insight Limo for any of your luxury ride needs.  The eight of us would give it a 10 star rating if there were that many stars. Thanks Jorge. -Sandy" Hopefully this helps. Next time I need a limo, this will be my first call. Can't get much passed my mom!
