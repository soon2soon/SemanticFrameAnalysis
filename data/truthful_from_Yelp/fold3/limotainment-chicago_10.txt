Mike and Priest are amazing.  We used Limotainment for our wedding transportation and it was flawless.  Priest was an excellent driver and got us to all our locations (for photos) with time to spare.  Mike was also amazing in the planning process and offered ideas for pictures and made sure the limo was in perfect shape! He also stocked the limo with adult beverages which we very much appreciated! A few months later, I am planning a large party and immediately thought of Mike to transport our guests.  Of course, I am using Limotainment and know it will be a great experience.  Thanks Mike!
