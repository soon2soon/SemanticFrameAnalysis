I recommended House 5863 to my dad and stepmom who were coming in to Chicago for a day visit. It was close to my place, it seemed cool and hip from the website, and I knew the owners from my restaurant. Let me just tell you 5 stars!!! I had to stop by and check the place out for myself. It is beautifully decorated with artwork, furniture, rugs, and stocked to the gill with food and drinks for guests to share. The place is spotless clean and the rooms are very reasonably sized (and priced). The whole place is like an art gallery!! We shared an afternoon sitting on the outdoor patio balcony, and also on the patio below which houses small gardens and decorated with whimsicle iron works of art. My parents had a great stay and could not get over how affordable and upscale looking this cute bed and breakfast was. I highly recommend House 5863 to anyone who has guests coming in to town. It's so much better than staying at a cheap hotel that is so unpersonable. House 5863 provides you with a great comfortable bed in a spotless and clean environment that is simply divinely decorated!
