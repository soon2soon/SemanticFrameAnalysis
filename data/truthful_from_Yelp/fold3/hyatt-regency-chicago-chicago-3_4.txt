I was trying to think of something wrong with this hotel and I really couldn't. I arrived on Thursday morning around 9 a.m. and I was able to check in immediately (which I was so grateful for). I was asked at the front desk what kind of room I wanted (which with Priceline bookings is rarely asked and you're usually treated like a second class citizen). I asked for a room on a higher floor and was given one on the 24th floor in the corner. Gave my gold passport number and got free internet. My room was clean and recently remodeled. It was a strange shape (it being in the corner and all) triangular. The room had a queen bed and two leather chairs. The TV was on the desk and swiveled for watching. It might have been a little tight with more than one person, but since I was by myself it was more than fine. The hotel is supremely centrally located. One block to Michigan Avenue and the perfect location for watching the river get turned green. I went to BIG bar, drinks were reasonably priced ($7 a pint) and they had a nice selection of tap beers. I had the Chicago Dog which was okay (I still like my hot dogs with mustard and sauerkraut only, sorry Chicago you won't convert me.) The only problem (which was slight) was I called about the NSTA shuttle that was running, and the desk clerk just kept reading me the flyer, and didn't really answer my questions, but whatever I figured it out. Priceline 4* hotel in the downtown area.
