I had a really good experience at the Hilton Chicago. I must qualify that by saying that I had status with Hilton this year, so that carried a little weight I'm sure. Check in was fast at 3:00 on a Friday afternoon. The agent who checked me in was pleasant and friendly. She asked if I'd stayed there before, and I replied that I'd stayed at lots of other Hiltons but not this one. She said, well let's see what we can do... And got me an upgrade to a suite on the executive floor, which was very nice. That included lounge access, health club access and internet. I think if I go back again, I might spring for these- well worth it. My room had a view of the lake and Grant Park. Not that big of a deal in February, but a nice touch The Hotel is a short walk from the red line "L" station, and the concierge desk pointed out some close-by landmarks for my short stay. Everyone was helpful and pleasant . The one downer- parking. Costs $50+ per day to park here. Worth asking if they can cut you a deal as a guest- they did for me. Saving $50 was worth the 5th star to me. And proves that if you want something Â be sure to ask. The worst they can do is say no. The best they can ( and in my case will) do is try to earn your business for the next time. And they succeeded- I will be back.
