Justin was an absolutely incredible captain. He worked with my boyfriend (now fianc√©) for months planning the perfect proposal. When the day came, it was relaxing, romantic and by far the best way to see the Chicago skyline. We even had a champaign toast after he popped the question. I couldn't have asked for a better day on the water. Highly recommended for any occasion.
