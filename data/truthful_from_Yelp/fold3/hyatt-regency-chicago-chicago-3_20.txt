STAY AT THIS HOTEL! We just came back from our first trip to Chicago, and while I don't write many Yelp reviews, I figured this hotel needed some credit! We lucked out and got a good deal on our stay through Hotwire. The Hyatt is in the PERFECT location! We were walking distance (less than 2 miles) to most major attractions. The hotel is very well-staffed. There were always people available to answer questions and point us in the right direction. The renovations are awesome and the hotel has a nice, new, modern feel. We got a room with a river view and it was awesome looking out every morning and night. Take advantage of social media after you book. Follow the hotel on Twitter and Facebook! They frequently post extras (i.e. free wi-fi codes) and may even leave a surprise in your room if you note your stay. VERY PLEASED! Will stay there on our next visit!
