I just spent my honeymoon at the Felix Hotel and our experience here was excellent! We had planned several stops and were on a budget and were lucky to find a great deal here through Priceline ($96 per night plus taxes). We were looking for a hotel in a good location but also that was nice and tidy and had a personal/unique touch. The Hotel Felix was perfect. The bed was incredible comfortable, the bathroom modern and clean (with L"Occitane products :) and the staff was very nice and attentive at all times and even helped us solve a personal issue we had with our luggage. Some aspects to consider: the rooms are small, the wifi didn´t run very well at all times and you can hear some noise coming from other guests and elevators (it is not too bad though. My husband didn´t even noticed it).   I gave it five stars because for the price it´s a fantastic deal. Will definitely stay again at  Hotel Felix if I ever go back to Chicago.
