I like this place...it's one of the chicer hotels I've ever stayed in...probably because I didn't have to drop any dough!  It was clean and new and our hotel room was super cute.  The beds were crazy comfy which made living here for a long weekend easy! We were put up here for a convention and things were pretty hectic but I felt as though the staff handled it really well. Parking is outrageous, but that's typical, just a heads up for those of you who don't know how parking a car in a Chicago hotel goes down. Check in and out were a breeze. And room service was awesome too. One morning took way longer than expected and we were going up run late..we called to cancel and as we were waking out they were delivering!  They gave us breakfast on them. "Especially since you're rushed and won't enjoy it," she said. I loved the delivery girl! I appreciate thy attention to the guest!
