Would highly recommend staying here while in Chicago if you are looking for an inexpensive option. Came here with my roommate to see the city and we were both pleasantly surprised by the decent quality of this hostel- really liked our shared room, kitchen, lounge space and bathroom. Set in the heart of downtown Chicago, it's very close to the train tracks- so wear ear plugs if you're a light sleeper or if you're super knackered like we were, it might not bother you too much. Free breakfast to start the day if you want it in the huge self-serve kitchen space, they have laundry facilities and a library also. Friendly staff in a great base for your Windy city stay. Definitely recommend
