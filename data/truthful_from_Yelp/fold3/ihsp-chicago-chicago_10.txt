I started backpacking throughout the United States earlier this month and have to say this has been my favorite hostel to stay in, by far. Had to log into Yelp for the first time in a few years to give this plug.. -The customer service here is top notch. They were super knowledgeable about the area and gave great tips throughout my stay. -The hostel has an AWESOME roof deck that is basically open whenever you want it. The Chicago skyline is really well defined. Nice place to kick back and enjoy a beer. -It is within half a block from the Blue Line Damen Station, within 10-15 minutes of downtown. -Foosball, Wii, pool, unlimited pancakes.. don't need to say much more. -Decent sized room for the price I paid. I was in a six person male shared room and it could have fit two more. Hats off to Josh, Olivia, and Ross (maybe another dude, too?).. had to grab their names before I left because I was so impressed.
