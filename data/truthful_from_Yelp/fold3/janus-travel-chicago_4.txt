My husband and I contacted Janus Travel to help us plan our honeymoon. Sue and Mark are awesome! They give you honest opinions of each resort and give you plenty of options within your price range. I definitely recommend this travel agency. Most people don't use travel agents anymore  but I'm really glad we did. We ended up staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Rivera Maya ( heaven side) which is all adults and it was FANTASTIC. We will definitely be using  Janus Travel again.
