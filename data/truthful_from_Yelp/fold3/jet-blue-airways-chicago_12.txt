I'm not a Chicago native, so I travel a fair amount back to the East Coast. I've flown on everything from U.S., Continental, American...however, the only airline, IMO, with consistently great customer service and affordability is Jet Blue. I've never had a problem flying with them. Not once have my bags been lost. The flights are always smooth and easy and the staff friendly. I'm pretty sure they're about the last airline that doesn't charge $15 for some chips and a drink, either. Not to mention, gotta love that free t.v :)
