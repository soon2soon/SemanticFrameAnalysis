Such an amazing brunch and definitely a highlight of my Chicago experience. The smoked salmon benedict was almost too beautiful to eat, but deconstructing it was oh so worth it. The egg was perfectly poached, the smoked salmon was amazing, the white hollandaise sauce had the right consistency and matched perfectly to the salmon. I honestly thought the salmon roe on top would clash with the hollaindase, but the slight saltiness of the roe was like the perfect amount of seasoning. If salmon for breakfast isn't your cup of tea, then you have to try the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken is extremely moist and the crispy batter is surprisingly light; the waffles are also noteworthy, but you'll be too enamored by the poultry. I also want to mention, Longman & Eagle chefs are true masters of the spud. Both the house potatoes served with the benedict and the sweet potatoes served with the chicken and waffles were the best form of carbohydrates ingested that weekend. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area. Our waitress was very friendly and the prices are beyond reasonable. Waiting times can get fairly long, but they have a really nifty bar/coffee shop that you can wait in until someone comes to retrieve you/call you.
