Just spent a four night stay in this hotel leading up to Thanksgiving. I've been to Chicago more times than I can count and it's rare that I stay the same place twice. This was my first time staying at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza and it was definitely a 5-star stay...once we found it. We could see the hotel from the Holiday Inn sign ontop of the hotel once we got off the train, but once we got to it, there's no sign on the doors to say that you're at the Holiday Inn...we thought going in the Illinois Institute Of Art was a mistake, but then we walked in and found a Holiday Inn sign (have to go to the 15th floor to check in. Our room was great, we had a corner room on the 21st floor. The bathroom was really nice, the bed was very comfortable and it was always kept clean. We didn't use the in-hotel restaurants or room service (which seemed a little pricey) but the lobby was always clean and a pleasure to walk through. The hotel location is nice, it's a short walk to the river north restaurants (Gino's, Rock Bottom, Ed Debevics, etc.) and it's a shorter walk to the brown line (L train). The only thing I wish we knew prior to our last day is that you can walk through the Merchandise Mart to get to the train instead of going out in the cold and walking around the Merch. Mart. If the price is still comparable when we visit Chicago next time, I'll definitely consider staying here again.
