LOVE this hotel!! The Staff are AMAZING, Service is quick & efficient, Concierge knows the ins & outs of Â Chicago (on average 12 new restaurants open in Chicago per month - I mean talk about knowing your city - impressed). The entrance is very open and spacious & I love that every sign/hotel map they have is digital. There is also an outdoor patio in the front with some fun style seating for those who are star-gazers... or smokers : ) FOOD & DRINK: The Market (snack shop) is open 24/7 and serves Starbucks There is a bar on the first floor & second (2nd has a huge stream of tvs - very fancy sport style) Breakfast downstairs is great - fresh oj & fresh squeezed apple juice is good, but not cold - I'd suggest the buffet - totally worth it, as in everything you could imagine for breakfast, even a huge jar of pistachios! TRANSPORTATION: They have the taxi stand down to a science. Very quick, never a line. Also, you can walk between the two towers through the 2nd floor skywalk, the street level outdoors, or the underground/lower level which includes multiple shops for food, dentist, beauty spa, etc. *Best Tip about this place: quick and easy check in & out - they have the traditional front desk as well as multiple kiosks if you're a digital style person - and these give you other info about the hotel.
