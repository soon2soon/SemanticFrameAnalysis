Outstanding efficiency, simplicity, functionality. Room was not full of clutter like most hotels. Queen size bed was comfortable and not overflowing with unnecessary pillows. Room was small but tidy. Free, excellent buffet breakfast with hot food including omelettes, pancakes, sausages, biscuits, gravy, coffee and more. The room was small by most standards but I am a New Yorker and found it adequate. Terrific location by Magnificent Mile. Stayed here for 2 nights and I highly recommend it to others.
