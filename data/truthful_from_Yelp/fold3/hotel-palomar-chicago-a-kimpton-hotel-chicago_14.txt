A fantastic hotel experience. Rooms were very nicely appointed and bed very comfortable. Location is perfect. Staff was great especially the concierge. However, it should be noted that the fixtures, table and desk chair were looking worn. Also, the mini bar fridge wasn't keeping things cold. At this level, I would expect a refresh of these items on a more frequent basis. The staff did repair the fridge quickly. Other than that was great. I would definitely go back.
