I am updating my review because Robyn Gevas went above and beyond AGAIN for my boyfriend and I in planning our latest vacation. Â We previously booked a Jamaican vacation, but because of the incident where a man lit the signal tower on fire in Aurora, we were unable to go on our trip! :-( Not only was Robyn there every step of the way during the crisis, but she also made sure we got refunded. Now fast forward a few months and we are planning to try Punta Cana. Robyn found us a GREAT deal for a 5 night stay at a top ten resort in the area we are traveling to. And to top it off, she helped us confirm and pay for our vacation on a Saturday. A SATURDAY!! Come on people, weekends are sacred and this woman took her time to help us! Her level of service deserves 5 stars in my book!
