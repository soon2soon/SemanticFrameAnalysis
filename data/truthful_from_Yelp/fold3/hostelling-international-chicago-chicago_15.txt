I stayed here recently with my nephew who just turned 18 for a couple nights in the windy city. Â Walking distance to museums and millennium park. Very friendly staff- and professional. The mural work is incredible. I recommend taking the stairs to your floor to experience it. Rooms are clean bathrooms are clean. It was as much part of the Chicago experience as the shows shopping and museums.
