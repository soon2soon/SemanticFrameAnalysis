LOVED this hotel.  AWESOME PLACE TO STAY!!! This is the second time that I have stayed at Homewood for a conference in Chicago.  We loved the full kitchen with fridge, stovetop, microwave, and dishwasher.  We were able to save a lot of money buy visiting the Jewel-Osco around the corner and having snacks and meals in the room as opposed to eating out each meal.  The living room area was comfortable with a TV, loveseat, and chair.  A table and chairs were in the kitchen area.  The bedroom also had a TV with vanity area separate from the bathroom, which allows for one person to shower while the other gets ready.  The decor was modern, but comfy and homey.  There was a free breakfast each morning.  There were four waffle makers, eggs, sausage, cereal, juices, fruit, pasteries, etc.  The only bad part of breakfast are the parents who let their children run through the area and attempt to make their own plates. The last day we fixed our plates and took them up to the room (highly recommended!).  The bellmen and clerk were wonderful and friendly.  The lobby is on the 6th floor and they were pleasant as well.  There is also a free dinner on M-TH, but we did not get to check that out.  We will definitely stay there for our upcoming trips!  It is close to several restaurants and to the grocery store.  MagMile is a short walk away. On a side note, the only unprofessional thing we encountered was the florist who was replacing plants in the hotel lobbies.  He and his co-worker argued in view of guests.  This has nothing to do with the hotel staff, but if the manager of Homewood reads these, perhaps she/he could talk with the florist that they contract with.
