Paula was fabulous! I can't say enough about how informative and interesting this tour was. I went on the Graceland Cemetery tour and it was excellent. I am a Chicago native and I learned so much about my city. She went above and beyond staying well past the 2 hour time. She is enthusiastic, well informed and loves what she does. I would absolutely recommend this company.
