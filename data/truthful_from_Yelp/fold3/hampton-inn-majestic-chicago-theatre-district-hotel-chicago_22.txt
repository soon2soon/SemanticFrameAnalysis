This is a great, cheap hotel in a historic building that once was the tallest in Chicago.  It is located less than a block from both the Red and Blue CTA lines.  The continental breakfast, while not gourmet, is an easy way to save a few bucks.  Access to the hotel floors is by key card only, so it's very secure.  All told, this is probably our hotel of choice in Chicago.
