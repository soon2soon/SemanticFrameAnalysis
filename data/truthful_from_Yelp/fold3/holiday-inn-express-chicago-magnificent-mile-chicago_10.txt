Wonderful! Got a good deal on the hotel, with a great location right off Michigan Ave. Very nice inside, and the room was very clean. Yes, it was small, but was totally fine with me as I was traveling alone. Might not be the best for small children though. Service was great, everyone at the front desk was super helpful, and they stored my luggage for most of the day after I checked out with no charge. Internet was free and pretty fast. Free breakfast was awesome! Cinnamon rolls--so good. And they had coffee, hot chocolate, and tea available all day. Very helpful for a long walk in wintry Chicago weather.
