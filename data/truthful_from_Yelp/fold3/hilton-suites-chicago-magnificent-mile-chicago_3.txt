I hosted a meeting here last week with people coming from all over the US. Extra kudos goes out to Jillian, Puran, and another gentleman who assisted with our catered lunch. I am still getting compliments on the facilities, guest rooms, and staff. I was worried the lovely songs of Chicago would keep me and our guests up at night (singing emergency sirens and traffic noise) but that wasn't the case. The hotel is tucked away off of Michigan Ave and across the street from the John Hancock. I also hosted a dinner at the Signature Room and being a short walk from the hotel was perfect. My guest room was great and the staff at the front desk was more than accommodating. Â  The Hilton Mag Mile went out of their way to earn these 5 stars. Hats off to a job well done.
