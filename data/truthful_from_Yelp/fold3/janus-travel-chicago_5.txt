I just went to a wedding in Riveria Maya, Mexico and the couple used Mark and Janus Travel to set up the accommodations.  The wedding was approximately about 100 people and all my friends had similiar opinions of Janus Travel.  The company was honest, responded timely to questions, and a pleasure to deal with.  Some folks had to deal with change of plans due to snow and ice and Mark was able to make some alternate plans to accomodate.  Never once did Janus try to sell me other than the vacation that was booked.  Him and his staff also were attentive to all my needs and responded quickly to any questions we had.  No wonder his business has been around all these years.
