Stayed here with my boyfriend on a weekend getaway and was blow away by this little gem. Great location makes it an easy cab ride to anywhere in the city, we had an amazing view from the room and the rooftop bar. The rooms were decently sized and the beds were fluffy and comfy, the only negative was the thermostat was a little tricky. Being from sunny California we're not too used to working a heater! The staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Â I travel often for business and never before been so impressed by a hotel's customer service. We came back to our room one day with a note saying my liquid foundation was accidentally broken while cleaning and a brand new bottle left in its place! Perfect brand, and perfect color. You have to check out the J.Parker on the top floor, get there a little early to see the sunset. The small bites and specialty drinks were delicious. I have a couple food allergies and our waitress was so helpful in working to find options I could eat. If I could give it 6 stars I would; I recommend this place to anyone staying in Chicago!
