I had a really outstanding experience at the Homewood Suites while traveling on business.  It's right in downtown/magnificent mile near most conferences.  The room/suite was huge with a full kitchen.  The free breakfast (and dinner M-Th, with wine) was actually pretty good for the midwest.  The staff was enthusiastically helpful.  The price ($135 with AAA rate) was agreeable.  I also got free use of the Crunch Fitness gym next door, which was amazing. I'd recommend staying here and walking to your conference nearby.. it's a much better experience than the standard corporate fare in Chicago.
