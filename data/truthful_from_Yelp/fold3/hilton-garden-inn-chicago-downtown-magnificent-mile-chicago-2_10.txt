I live in the city, but stayed here 8/9-8/11 for my wedding 8/10. When we checked in, the front staff was very friendly and when she found out it was our wedding weekend, upgraded us a city view room. We ended up in room 2007, which is the year my husband and I met! Beautiful view looking down Grand and State. Saturday before our reception, the staff brought champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our room! Very sweet and courteous of them! Everyone we encountered who worked there was always very friendly and helpful. Our room was large, bed was adjustable and everything was very clean. Pool is nice, the pool room could use a little more ventilation, but we swam for a while comfortably.
