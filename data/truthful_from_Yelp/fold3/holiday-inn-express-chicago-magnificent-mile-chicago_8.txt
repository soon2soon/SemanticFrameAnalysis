My girlfriend and I came back to Chicago a few weeks back for a wedding and stayed at this hotel on Sunday Nov 10th till Monday the 11th. The only con of this Hotel is that the rooms are really small, but that is okay, because who cares when it comes to the service, location and overall staff. We got to check in early so I had plenty of time to get ready for the Bears game. We were allowed to check-out late to recover from the Bears game and a night of Heavy Chicago Drinking. The staff was excellent, everyone was really nice and wanted to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. The Breakfast is BOMB. Don't sleep on it, don't. One other thing I would suggest, if you are driving, there is a parking lot right on the corner that is 14.00 a day for hotel guest. We lived in Chicago combined over 10years and this is where we will be staying when we come to visit.
