If there was a way to give JetBlue 10 stars, I would do it. If JetBlue is going where I need to be, I will do whatever it takes to get on their flight. Lately I've been noticing that the roles have been reversed. I now need to go wherever Jetblue is going. I dream about the flight sometimes. The first time I got on JetBlue, the CEO of the company served me cookies and a coke. It was the first flight out of O'Hare to New York. My friend and I watched a LOT of Sweet 16 on MTV and talked about buying stock in between commercial breaks. Fast forward two years later, and I got on JetBlue again headed to New York, again. Again, I watched a lot of Sweet 16. Again, my friend (another one) and I could not stop talking about the comfort involved with flying JetBlue. Leather seats, Direct TV, snacks, leg room a GO GO, the awesome terminal in JFK with futuristic seating, cheap flights. What more can you ask for?
