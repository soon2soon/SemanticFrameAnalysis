I am always a fan of Kimpton Hotels and this one fits in with many of my Kimpton !experiences.  It recently went through renovations and is nicely updated!   What does this hotel have that others don't? 1) Great location, about 2 blocks from Millemium park and close to great restaurants 2) Wine Happy hour - All Kimptons have this :) 3) Friendly Staff 4) Great workout facility! You won't be dissapointed!
