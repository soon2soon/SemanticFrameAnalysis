Who would have thought that the holiday inn would be so swanky! Very nice and beautiful hotel. Awesome view of the city. The rooms are nice and feature awesome Chicago architectural art throughout. Staff was friendly and the location is great for theater, entertainment and dining. Will definitely be back!
