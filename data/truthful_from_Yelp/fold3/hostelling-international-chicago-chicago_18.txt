YES. Forget paying $80 a night for a cheap ass hotel. Just go to this Hostel! It's basically like a hotel, if you get the private suite. And it's only about $38 a night. Half the price of a dingy hotel far from downtown Chicago. You'll end up paying quadruple the amount just for travel fare. The hostel is located walking distance to the Art Institute Museum, The Bean, Field Museum, Aquarium, Soldier Field, "Magnificent Mile", and many other Chicago tourist attractions. We stayed at the private suite which was a suite with four private rooms and a shared bathroom. We went during a non-busy season (early May) so we had the bathroom to ourselves. The room included a bunk bed (bottom bunk is bigger than the top bunk), a dresser, desk, and a chair. They give you free fresh towels every morning, & fresh sheets. It's really clean! & Free Wi-Fi! Bring your laptop, iPod touch, iPhone! The staff is very nice and helpful, and there are free maps and free event information everywhere. We had a great time in Chicago; largely thanks to HI Chicago!
