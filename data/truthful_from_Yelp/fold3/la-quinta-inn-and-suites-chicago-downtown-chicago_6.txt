Great deal in downtown Chicago.  Love this place!  Wife and I get away once a month and head in to the city.  We have stayed at LQ for the last 4 trips into Chicago PROS - NO BED BUGS, free breakfest, pool, Keurig machine in room, friendly staff, great Ass't General Manager (had a problem during last visit - see cons - noise but AGM made it right), did I mention no bed bugs, smoking rooms, free WiFi CONS - a bit noisey at times - doors slamming, kids running up and down hallway, no bathtub (wife's con)
