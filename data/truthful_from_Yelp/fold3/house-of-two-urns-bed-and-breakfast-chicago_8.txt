(Psst! This is a third person review. Can I do that? We will see.) Speaking for Eric and the I'm Vegan crew who stopped in Chicago to film some animal-free peeps on their national Vegan Documentary Tour: this place is awesome. The guys asked me where to stay near my place night before we filmed and I was like- hey- there's this B&B- but I don't know much... The next morning they were like- HEY. You must recommend this place a lot. I was like- No, never before sir. They were like- really!? This is the perfect B&B for visiting vegans. wh-what?! No, truly. Believe me. Stop being so skeptical. It's true!! Don't you just love surprises?? I do. :) Yes- Two Urns' totally reasonable rated rooms (starting at $125) including breakfast, also include an amazing vegan breakfast option! Visiting Chicago, need a night sleep, and not into eating your friends? Voila. You're. welcome.
