Whenever I can stay at a Homewood Suites I will. This is my second time at a Homewood suite (first time in Chicago) and it never fails to disappoint. The studios are so roomy and I love that not only is it free wi-fi in your room, but you also get a kitchen. Granted no oven, but everything else you can need (dishwasher, dishes, mini stove, full size fridge, etc). Besides the rooms being lovely and nice lounges, at this location there was coffee, teas, hot chocolate, and cider available all day. Monday-Thursday is a themed dinner, with beer, red and white wine. Really there is no need to go out for dinner as what they provide is really tasty and very filling. A breakfast buffet is served 7 days a week and it is well worth sampling. I truly love staying here. The only downside which I did not take out on the Homewood suite is the parking. Overnight guest parking is $55 a night. Granted I know that has a lot to do with being in Downtown Chicago, but come on. But for $99 a night (not sure how much it is on the weekends, as I came on a Thursday night), you really do get a lot of bang for your buck.
