i think the real issue here is, why the hell didn't i think of this sooner? after giving taxis more than ample excuses i decided not to be blown off and do things right. i looked here for recommendations and i am glad i did. it was a gamble to use the service for the first time on christmas eve day to go to the airport and they did not dissapoint. they were not only on time, but they arrived early and patiently awaited until my actual pickup time. they were/are excellent and extremely well organied. both drivers i had--milan and john--were sweet as pie and professional. i will most definitely use them again in the future and you should too.
