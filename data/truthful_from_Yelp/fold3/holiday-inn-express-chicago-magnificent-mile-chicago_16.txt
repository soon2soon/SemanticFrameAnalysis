Great staff, free wifi, cute room - I was in town for a conference, and since the dresser was microscopic I just spread all of my clothes on the unused other bed and could visualize my entire wardrobe each morning, like a fancy princess.  The service was so nice - they brought items immediately, they offered me bkfst when I arrived super-early the day I was to check in, they always offer to call a cab.  There's a Trader Joe's across the street.  Hotel is 2-3 blocks from metro, so I took a train from Midway, no problem.  Neighborhood is fine.   At one point in the weekend I happened to do something mildly clever and someone said, "Oh how clever!" and I totally got to say, "Well, I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night!"
