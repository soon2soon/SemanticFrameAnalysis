Many years ago, we showed up at L&E for brunch and was told it was a 2 hour wait. I didn't bother until now hoping the hype died down. This time I happen to be in the area on a Saturday morning at 9 and there were plenty of tables available. I was deciding between the Whole Hog Crepinette and Pina Colada French Toast. My server says to go with the hog as it's only available on the weekends. While wating, I got to sample a bite from the kitchen, it's what you see in a fancy gourmet restaurant that serves something delicious on a spoon - all complimentary too, which was a nice bonus.  Shortly after, my food came out. What a pleasant hearty brunch. it's sorta like a pulled pork cake plated with cheesy grits and syrupy greens. This could easily be a entree! I was having such a great time, I got a side of toast. Even the bread is yummy with the housemade butter and cherry jam. I ate everything. . Being that my first dish was absolutely delicious. I came back the next day and got the french toast. I love a good panna cotta and that coconut one that came in that dish is very coconutty. Candy bacon were hidden among the dish. Even the added greens and tiny bits of pineapple gave a nice contrast.  Honestly, I have no problems coming back and trying every single one of their dishes. It is THAT good. It is now my top brunch spot in Chicago. So the question remains, is it worth the two hour wait? Maybe... My advice, get there early (service is also better). Nobody should wait that long, BUT if you are prepared to wait, go to the back and grab a seat at OSB and get a drink or snack. That is one odd thing the hostess don't do is inform customers about OSB espeically when it's a 1-2hr wait. They just kinda say it very nonchalantly.
