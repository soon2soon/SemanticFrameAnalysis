This was our first time going to a Travel Agency. We were planning a destination wedding and needed all the help we could get. Before we got there we were lost and confused and stressed. Sara was our travel agent and within minutes made us feel at ease. She was kind, helpful and explained everything to us. We asked her so many questions and she had a answer for all of them. Dominic was also helpful during this process. We even laughed and shared pictures of our dogs. We would definitely use these services again. Thank you guys! Our trip was amazing. And the travel part was as smooth as you said it would be.
