You can't beat the location & price of this hotel. For the incredibly reasonable price of ~$130/night, you are close to all the action in downtown Chicago. I was visiting with my wife on this trip to see The Book of Mormon at the Bank of America Theatre. I was pleased to find out that we didn't even need to step outside of the hotel to get to the theatre. Rooms were clean. Customer service was outstanding. Cheap rates & valet parking. What more could you ask for?
