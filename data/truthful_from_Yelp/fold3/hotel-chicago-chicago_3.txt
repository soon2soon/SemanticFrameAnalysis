Wonderful Hotel! You may not have the perfect view of the river but your right next to it! FYI, Only king bedrooms will have partial view of the river from what I was told. This Hotel, formerly Sax Hotel was freshly renovated and everything was very clean, fresh and well done! All of the staff was helpful and went out of their way to make sure your accommodations were enjoyable. Prices were moderate not too expensive but the location was high end! BTW, the WIFI worked very well in the rooms for those who are curious due to being in the city. Paul Mitchel amenities, Linens were fresh, crisp and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, very nice done and spacious! The rooms were very quiet, no paper thin walls here. Coffee machine in room and the usual. Room service available. Bar downstairs just opened up as I was checking out but it looks superb! Everyone and everything was so nice!!! The doorman, I wish I could remember his name: he was awesome. Gave us perfect directions, great information and was a pleasure to be greeted by. I have nothing but nice things to say about this hotel. I would definitely stay here again and I recommend it!!!! Well done Hotel Chicago and thank you!
