So after reading all the wonderful reviews i decided to go ahead and book my stay with this particular Hyatt! I am so pleased with my recent stay for several reasons! Location! Location! Location! I loved the fact that this place is smack dead in the middle of everything and very close to some major retail shopping and great places to eat! You literally don't even need a car when staying at this location, tis the reason why they might charge so much for valet. After doing my homework prior to booking this stay i knew i wasn't willing to pay $59 a night for valet! Outta this world crazy! Anywho the remodeling of this place did great wonders because it is so luxury looking. I Booked the Executive King Suite and I must recommend this to everybody who wants a room that has PLENTY of space! The decor and layout of this room is fantastic there is a huge flat screen in the living room with some comfortable couches to go along. The bathroom is a bit dim but the bedroom is even better! King Bed was beyond comfortable. I requested a high floor and didn't quite get that but it levels out because i was put in a room that WASN'T facing the hospital. Either way you hear the sirens though, if you can get past that you will love this property! My last minor complaint would be that when the heater is on it makes a really annoying noise and the fact that you have to take two different elevators just to get to your room is a bit much but doesn't take away the great quality of this hotel! Good Job Hyatt :-)
