This is a great alternative to the large traditional hotel. The rooms are smaller, but very stylish and efficient. Service was excellent. I appreciate the artistic decor and the proximity to Chicago North River nightlife is outstanding. I will definitely stay at Hotel Felix again. The value cannot be beat!
