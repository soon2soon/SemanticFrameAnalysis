LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!!  Located in the heart of Chicago, everything is within walking distance, so much to see, so much to explore!  Hotel is very nice and very relaxing, just what the doctor ordered.  The decor is nice, the place is clean!  Oh and they have down feathered pillows, those are a must! :) There's a lounge, gym, and breakfast in the Morning!  I would love to stay here again!
