We usually stay at HP hotels when traveling, and I can say that the River North location is the best HP we've ever used.  First, the location can't be beat.  It is perfect.  The hotel is clean, the amenities are fantastic (the gym is wonderful), the breakfast spread was huge and always full of food regardless of the crowds, and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Parking was easy (though costly, but in line with what you would expect in a major city) and even though we didn't have one of the rooms with a view, our non-view room still had a great view.  I am already looking forward to our return trip there.
