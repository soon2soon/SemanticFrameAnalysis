I really enjoyed my stay here, it's in a great neighborhood, it's comfy, and very accommodating. Our room was small, just 2 bunk beds, a mirror and a chair but the beds were comfy and I really didn't mind the small space. The common room was awesome, with a big kitchen (where they have free bagels and cereal every morning), a couple games, tables, a big couch and a tv. The bathrooms were great as well. The staff was helpful and friendly. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely be staying here.
