Best whiskey cocktails and the largest whiskey selection I've ever seen. I highly recommend the Vice President or their Old Fashion if you want a whiskey cocktail.  If you like a gin cocktail, the Cold Wind cocktail is good and refreshing.   Cool casual atmosphere, doesn't have that stodgy restaurant feel to it like most Michelin star rated places.  We sat at the bar just for some drinks and loved seeing the bartender create their masterpiece drinks.  We got here at 8 ish on a Friday night and it seemed like the dinner rush was just winding down, there were a couple tables available and a handful of seats at the bar.  I'm sure during meal rushes the place gets really crowded due to its small size.  The service was good, strong but great tasting drinks and love the dimly lit atmosphere. Definitely coming here again!
