We have always booked our trips online but knowing that we have never been to Italy, we needed a travel agent.  We called Liberty and Alex answered.  She planned our dream vacation to Italy.  She was amazing.  So patient with our many phone calls and visits and so knowledgeable about Italy.  All of our hotels (8 of them!) were perfect and it was so nice to be able to walk into a hotel and hand them a piece of paper and that was it... We are already planning our return and will use Alex for all of our travel needs in the future.  Thanks Alex and Liberty.
