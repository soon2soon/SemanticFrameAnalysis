Mark Janus was recommended to us by one of my fianc√©'s co-workers back in November 2008....we were looking for a vacation in March of 2009. Throughout the months leading up to the cruise I had many phone conversations with Mark, and each time he was very knowledgeable and never just told me a glossed over description of places, I felt that he really was looking out for what we wanted in our vacation. All of these conversations led up to a great 7 day cruise to the Western Caribbean, he was able to get us a really low price, and when the cruise price dropped even more, he was able to get us OBC (on board credit)....for the price difference, even after we had made a complete payment. We are now working on our wedding/honeymoon with Mark
