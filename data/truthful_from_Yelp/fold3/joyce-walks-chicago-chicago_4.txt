Joyce gives the best tours of anyone in the city! She is down-to-earth and really passionate about the city and its history. I took a tour with her last year when I visited Chicago. I did the Mansions of Kenwood tour. The tour was great. I was able to see where the Obama's live and also saw some other beautiful homes. The tour was small and we went at a leisurely pace which gave us enough time to really see the neighborhood. The tour wasn't too long as it was about 2 miles long. Highly recommend if you're interested in doing a walking tour!
