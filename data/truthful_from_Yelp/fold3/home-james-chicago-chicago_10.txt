The timing for entertaining a good ol' Home Jamesing couldn't have been more apropos. My 6am flight from ORD to BOS following a weekend of Pitchforking (no spooning) was not a welcome one. Originally planning on riding the Blue, I noticed the Yelp Deal for a $30 ride to or from ORD (originally $60). The stellar reviews meant one thing: transaction. Ka-ching! Called and spoke with Sal, mentioned my immediately acquired Deal and gave him the scoop. Having seen but never woken up to 4:15a, I asked if it's doable. He laughed and replied, "I just did a pick up for 3:00am. There's no time too early." Bonus. And true to form, Sal himself arrived 5 minutes early in an immaculate town car. The little cup of Fun Size Snickers fell on deaf teeth, but the mini water bottles provided welcome hydration. Sensing my zombie state, Sal dropped the volume on the radio and let me snooze an extra 20 as he navigated the barren freeways of Chicago with a smoothness that I slept through. And that is telling. When we arrived, he had my bag curbside before I could fumble my way out of the plush backseat. It was a flawless, five star trip and definite go-to for future, nightmare flights. Sidenote: There is a $15 surcharge for pick-ups made before 4:30am. Sal mentioned this as we curbed the airport, and I offered to pay, but he waived the fee because he forgot to tell me on booking. Great business ethic!
