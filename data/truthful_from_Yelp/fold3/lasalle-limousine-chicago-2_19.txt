I've been a frequent business traveler for about seven years, and after finally getting fed up with cabbies not willing to take credit cards, I decided to check out car services. Of course, the first place I checked was here on yelp! The reviews for Lasalle Limo were very positive so I decided to give them a try. After two months and approximately 12 pick-ups, I can honestly stay that they have never been late (even very early on Monday mornings) and are always professional. Airport pick-ups are a breeze and the prices are competitive. Keep up the great work, Lasalle Limo!
