Wow! Talk about getting special treatment! Check in was easy and quick. We shared that we were there for a birthday weekend. We were given a great room on the 16th floor (could have had a better view, but weren't there long so didn't care much). Â Later in the afternoon we got a special cupcake delivery to the room with a note from the front desk staff! The beds were comfy, we all slept well. Pillows could have had a firmer option, but overall great pillows. I had read mixed reviews about the shower and hot water, but our showers were plenty hot and there were 3 of us. Considering the area, the room was a great size over what I'd typically expect in the location. Wish we had had time to experience the pool as the view looked amazing! Only downside I will give is the breakfast vouchers which came with our price of the night. We showed up to find out that only Brunch is served on weekends which isn't included in the voucher. Since we were only there one night, it got us toast and fruit only. We weren't expecting to have to pay for breakfast but by the time we sat down and looked at the menu, we were interested in more than toast and fruit only. Putting that aside Sable offers an AMAZING brunch! Top notch service, great staff and the best breakfast we've ever had. We will definitely, definitely be back.
