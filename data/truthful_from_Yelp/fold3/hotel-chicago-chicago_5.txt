The lobby is still under renovation but the location is great for most needs, my room was spacious and beautifully decorated, and the overall vibe was upscale, trendy, and comfortable.  Pricing can be a bit on the high side but of course this is Chicago and it only gets worse during the summer so you kind of have to expect it.  That being said, I'd prefer to stay here as opposed to other Marriott properties in town such as the Michigan Ave flagship, the Renaissance hotels, and of course the lower end brands which are a bit cheaper but not nearly as comfortable.  I'm looking forward to seeing the lobby, but from what I've seen so far this will be a winner - not sure if they'll keep the generic Hotel Chicago name which I don't love but any way you look at it this property appears to be a great choice for most travelers.
