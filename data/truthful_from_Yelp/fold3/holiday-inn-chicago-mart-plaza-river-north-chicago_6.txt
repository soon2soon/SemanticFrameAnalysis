I have lived in Chicago my entire life and yet, have never been to this particular Holiday Inn, and after what I saw this evening I have been majorly missing out! Tonight I was included in an Open House that The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza was hosting, and my evening started off with great conversation with Debra Potter who is the Sales Manager and with a lovely glass of wine from the bar, A great way to start the evening! Honestly, I haven't stayed at a Holiday Inn for many years and what I remembered/recalled was nothing like I saw tonight, this place is incredible, I actually went on a tour tonight with Molly who is/was the best tour guide ever, and was able to see the rooms as they look now, they are sleek and modern, with free Wi-Fi, a lovely sitting area as well as a great flat screen T.V.. And, the views, stunning to say the least! and you get this phenominal view from every direction of this hotel. Holiday Inn has done a major re-vamping of their hotel, and you can see it everywhere you look! I was able to meet 3 people from Holiday Inn tonight, I met Debra Potter, Molly Paschal who is the Business /Sales Manager and I met France Langan, Director of Sales and Marketing, I also met other staffers as well and I have to say these people work as this incredible team, everyone is in synch here! They impressed me very much! This whole evening was impressive, from the first sip of wine, to the tremendous carving stations and to the tour from Molly. But, mostly, I am impressed with this Holiday Inn itself, because Â everything about it just seems so right, everything seems to fit perfectly. So, Thank You to everyone from the Holiday Inn for Including me, It was a lovely night and I fell completely in love with your hotel. And, Thanks for the great gift bag! You've got such a great place here, And one night very soon I know I'll be paying you a visit.. Can't be soon enough for me..:) I know a Class Act when I see one..:)
