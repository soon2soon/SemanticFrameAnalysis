My wife and I celebrated our honeymoon with the staff at the Hard Rock ten years ago... Needless to say we were blown away by our room, the view, and most importantly by how we were treated. I have made reservations for our ten year anniversary in December... We love Chicago.. The people,the town and definitely the Hard Rock. PS. Scott with the conceiage has already been most helpful picking out restaurants and making reservations. The Hard Rock Rocks!
