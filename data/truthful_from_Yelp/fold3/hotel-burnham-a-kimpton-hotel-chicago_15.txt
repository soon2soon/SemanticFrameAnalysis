Booked this hotel on hotels.com for a last minute trip to Chicago.    I was a little aprehensive as our room was 1/2 if not 1/3rd of all the other hotels in the loop.  But for one night, and considering the location I decided to give it a go.  Plus all the reviews I saw were positive. I can say without a doubt that if I'm back in Chicago I'll be staying here again! The staff was amazing, we actually checked in at 11am just to drop off our bags and our room was already ready.  The location was perfect! Super close to everything you could possibly want to do, and close to the train stop from the airport.    The wine hour was a nice touch as well.   The room was clean, probably the cleanest hotel bathroom floor I've ever seen!
