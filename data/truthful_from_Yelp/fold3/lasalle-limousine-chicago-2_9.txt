Found LaSalle on trusty YELP! Thanks for that! Used them for a business trip. They were absolutely perfect. They: - Â gave me clear guidance on how ot meet the driver (Suggested meeting at the Hilton to avoid confusion). - Did a wonderfully efficent booking for the trip to and from Southeast Chicago (hell and gone) - Emailed me confirmations including phone numbers. - Were prompt, polite and on time. All you'd want in a car service.
