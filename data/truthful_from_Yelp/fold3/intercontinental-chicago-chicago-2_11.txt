My husband and I chose the InterContinental Michigan Avenue for our wedding because we wanted a hotel where absolutely everything would be taken care of with first class quality.  Our expectations were exceeded! The catering team was very easy to work with, proactive in helping us and accommodating to our needs. Our dog was able to be in the wedding!!! We did NOT want a venue that looked like another hotel ballroom. The IC's historic tower was built in the 1930's, and it feels like a castle with old world decor. It also gave us lots of fabulous options for photos. Our guests were WOW-ed. Some told me it was the most beautiful wedding they had ever attended.  I wanted a breath taking wedding that would WOW guests - and I got it!! Absolutely everything was perfect. My husband and I would not change a thing.
