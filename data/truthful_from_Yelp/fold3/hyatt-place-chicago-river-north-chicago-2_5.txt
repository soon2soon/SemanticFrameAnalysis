This hotel was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in.  The staff were all lovely, professional and generous with their time.  They made sure every need was satisfied and every question was answered!  The cocktails and snacks in the evening were a lovely way to end a long day of sightseeing.  The parking was a bit high at $62 a day to valet it but that turned out to be pretty standard here in the city.  There is easy access to the "L" and the Metra from the hotel.  Also look into the CityPass, we saved well over $200 and got to see all the major attractions!  This hotel has been well worth every penny and I highly recommend it!
