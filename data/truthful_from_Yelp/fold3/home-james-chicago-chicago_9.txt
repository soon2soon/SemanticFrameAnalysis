I've used a cheaper service in Chicago before...and I received what I paid for. I used Home James this time around, and I received the ABSOLUTE best service ever! Ozzie, our driver from the airport and from the hotel on our way back, was excellent. Driving smoothly, polite, eager to please, he's a true asset to the company! So if you need a ride from the airport to your hotel and from your hotel to the airport, Home James is THE only way to go. A+ !
