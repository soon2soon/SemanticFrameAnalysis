I highly recommended this hotel. I thought it was a good place to start your vacation. Kinzie Hotel Â is a excellent hotel. The location is the best in the loop town. Also, when you ready to check-in,you would find that the people who works in the front desk was friendly. Meanwhile, the room are clean.
