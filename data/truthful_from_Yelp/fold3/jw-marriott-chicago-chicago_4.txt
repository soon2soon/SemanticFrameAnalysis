This has quickly become one of my favorite hotels just about anywhere. The concierge and front desk have been very friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic, the rooms are beautiful. The level of service and attention to detail by both the exec lounge and room cleaning staff is impeccable. Love that they turn down the sheet and leave a mint at bedtime. Really, they haven't overlooked a thing. Â Yes, it's on the pricier side, but worth it - especially if you get their rewards.
