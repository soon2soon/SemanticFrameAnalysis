FANTASTIC LOCATION! Wonderful staff! Ayite IS THE BEST!!! Nathan goes out of his way to make sure you get where you're going! The room we had was WONDERFUL! Everything was what I had expected from a 5-Star Hotel! What you needed, was provided by the hotel staff! We celebrated our 1 year anniversary at your hotel and I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!! IT WAS GREAT!!! WE WILL BE BACK!!!
