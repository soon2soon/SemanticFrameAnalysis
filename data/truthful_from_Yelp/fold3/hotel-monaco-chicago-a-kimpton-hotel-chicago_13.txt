5 stars for this Chicago location.   Located 2 blocks from the famed Chicago theater and on the Chicago river, with accessible transport to the L via the State/Lake stop two blocks away.   The river view hotel room was just everything my girlfriend and I were looking for.  There is a window seat that is made of memory foam and is actually large enough for one to take a nap in.  The room is spacious, as well as the bathroom.   Most importantly, the hotel is CLEAN. The bathroom was clean, the sheets were and everything was just 5 star worthy, especially the buy two nights, get one free.   The staff was very accommodating, the doorman was able to get a cab for us within a minute and they held our luggage when our departure was well after check out. Overall if you are looking for an awesome hotel to stay in while in Chicago, this is the place to go.
