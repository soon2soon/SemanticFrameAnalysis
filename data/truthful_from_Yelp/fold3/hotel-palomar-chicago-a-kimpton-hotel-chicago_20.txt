I stayed here with my partner over my birthday weekend last year--I am WAAAY behind in my reviews for this amazing hotel. First of all, the concierge (the only female, I forgot her name...damn) was THE BEST because we wanted to see a show at "The Second City" but all the tickets were sold out. We had been running all over town all day and were exhausted so when we finally decided to go see a show, we were too late! She got on the phone with their box office and got us some of the last tickets to the show for that night! It definitely made our trip even BETTER than it already was--she also hooked us up with a ride to the show since we didn't have much time to get there. Aside from the amazing service--this hotel is very well appointed in its location. It's close to all the train lines, restaurants, and within incredible walking distance to the best sights of Chicago. While it is not on a canal, we didn't have any problem finding things to do. My only wish would've been to stay longer. I became quite attached to our room--which was a fabulous suite that overlooked the courtyard below. We were on the top floor...which was an added bonus since Chicago has the most beautiful skyline in the US...sorry NY, but it's true. When I go back to Chicago, I will definitely stay here over The Monaco for location, but honestly, Kimpton is fantastic at every turn, so I would never turn down a chance to stay at any one of them.
