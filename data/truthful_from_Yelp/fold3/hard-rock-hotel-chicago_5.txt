Our family had a memorable trip to Chicago thanks to the Hard Rock Hotel Â We loved the historic decor, rock music and our son got to play an electric guitar for the first time. The Congeries were great and pointed us to the perfect restaurants and helped us find the bus pickup location for a ride to the printing conference we were attending. We even got to see them filming the transformer movie from our window. If you want something to take back home with you this is the place to stay. Memories last a lifetime.
