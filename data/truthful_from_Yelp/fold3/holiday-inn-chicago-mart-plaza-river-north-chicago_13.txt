Almost two weeks ago we had our wedding here.  I cannot express enough how important it was to Janet, France, Brian and the entire staff that they ensure our wedding was perfect from start to finish - and it was.  Attention was given to the biggest details all the way down to making sure my last minute cake topper arrival was placed beautifully on our cake.  The day of the wedding Janet was available the entire day to address anything that needed attention and to make sure we stayed on track.  The food....AMAZING!  My mom who has been to so many weddings and eats regularly at fine dining restaurants said this was the best food she has ever had at a wedding.  Beside all of the compliments we received the night of the wedding we also received phone calls and text msgs for days after raving about the food and venue. Our room was spacious and was a great place for us to relax with our bridal party and family before the ceremony began.  There is not one thing we can say we wish was done differently or better.  If you love the city as much as we do and want to be married surrounded by the views this is the place to go.  Thank you all at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza for making our day one we will never forget!
