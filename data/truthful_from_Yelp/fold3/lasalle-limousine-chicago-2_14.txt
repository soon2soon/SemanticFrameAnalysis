I really didn't want to rent limos for my wedding. I wanted the bridal party to travel via cabs especially since we had a complicated travel system and cabs can take much longer. However, I was concerned that I might get into a cab that was dirty and it would stain my dress. (Bloody wedding nightmares!) Anyhoo, as a long standing customer of La Salle, they upgraded my town car to a limo. It was very nice of them. It wasn't anything fancy but I did NOT WANT a bridal limo. I was very pleased. I would highly recommend.
