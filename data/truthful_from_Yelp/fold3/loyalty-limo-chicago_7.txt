I found Loyalty Limo here on Yelp when I was looking for a limo for my wedding this past June, 2013. I ended up going with them based on the superior reviews, even though it was a little pricier (though not much) than some other companies with some negative reviews.  That was definitely the way to go! I appreciated the ease of contact before the wedding day and that David, our driver, arrived right on time the day-of. He was extremely courteous and professional.  He was well-dressed and the limo was perfectly clean and well stocked with drinks. My photographer was actually the most impressed since he sees limos constantly when working weddings.  He said he's seen many that are dirty, or smell like smoke. David drove well, knew his way around downtown, and had an umbrella over me the moment it started to drizzle.  Fabulous service. I will definitely call Vince next time I need to rent a limo.
