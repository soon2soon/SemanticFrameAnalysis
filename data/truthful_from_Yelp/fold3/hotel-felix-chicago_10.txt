great place - small rooms, but we weren't there to hang out in the room.  The staff knew it was our anniversary and there was a bottle of wine in the room when we arrived.  I would have liked our own coffee maker, but they do offer free coffee in the lobby - and free wifi in the entire hotel.  Great location.  Quiet room on the top floor.  I would stay here again.
