Aimee assisted my wife and I with planning our Sandals honeymoon in St. Lucia.  She was very informative, provided great suggestions, and also was able to get us into an upgraded room (with butler service and a private pool) for less than it would've cost us to book directly with Sandals.  I would highly recommend Aimee and definitely plan to utilize her services again the future.
