Our family stayed three nights in Chicago over thanksgiving with our 11 month old labradoodle.   We were in the Mediterranean Suite and absolutely had a wonderful time. Pros:  service was amazing in every area.  Door men welcomed us and our dog multiple times a day like we were coming home.  The concierge, front desk and maids were equally amazing.   The hotel loves having pets stay with them.  Room was huge and the carve out Window seats were a place to take in the river view.  Very convenient access to shopping and restaurants. Cons:  only con was the bathroom shower was tiny.  There was a huge soaking tub that I would rather have replaced by a large shower.  Very minor con but giving balanced rating. We will be back again!
