The law of diminishing marginal utility does not apply to Hyatt Place, because I could stay here repeatedly for weeks and months and never feel like I've lost any satisfaction.  Yes it is that good.  Why?  Because I've stayed at plenty of hotels and few compare to the wonderful, vacation-like experience offered by Hyatt Place.  Even though I use it primarily for business travel you are set apart from the rest of the crowd into a relaxing atmosphere. To backup my claims I am reminded of the smell of the hand soap, the updated interior design and modern layout of the lobby, the fabric of the couch, the pleasing color schemes, the plush bedding, the large flat-panel TV on a swivel, and overall sensation of accomplishment you can achieve just by staying here a single night.  Wake up the next morning and you are treated to a breakfast bar that includes heavy silverware, solid plates with interesting triangle or other shapes, and a healthy mixture of grains, fruit, yogurt, juice, muffins, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, and on it goes until you are once again starting your day fully satisfied. However they came up with the combinations and execution of ideas, they got it right!  I am thankful for Hyatt Place.  Since it is unlikely IMHO that other hotels will ever learn from them, that's fine, because if I can seek out a Hyatt Place I will definitely stay there if I can.
