Great hotel, great location. Hotel is located Across the street from a beautiful park full of beautiful landscaping, fountains, and various art pieces, and of course, the great lake. Our room boasted a great view of all of this as well. Â Also the hotel has 2 spas and a heated pool which was basically unused while we were there so we had it all to ourselves. Good clean and comfy rooms at a cheap price compared to other hotels I'm the area. The hotel also was located in walking distance to all the major shopping locations as well as several good jazz and Irish pubs which we enjoyed tremendously, great trip in large part to this hotel!
