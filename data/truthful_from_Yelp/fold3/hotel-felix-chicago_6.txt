Stayed here while visiting Chicago in Summer 2012 for one Wednesday night only. Scored it on Priceline for $101 (plus tax) which was cool. Front desk attitude was a little cold but check-in was easy... Like other reviews I read the hallways and the rooms were quite small. I didn't mind it though because it was just the two of us and the beautiful modern look and feel of the entire queen bedroom we walked into was very welcoming. This hotel is only three walking blocks from the train system, around the corner from many great bars and restaurants, and is across the street from an easy parking deck ($30/overnight). PROS: location, comfort of bed and linens, H2o soap samples, windows opened, clean clean clean. CONS: Small lobby. There wasn't a continental breakfast. We could also swear we heard a vacuum cleaner a few floors up around midnight. No view from our room. I would stay here again if it were just a night or two and I could get the same great rate.
