This hotel rocks -- I had a blast staying here for three days. The best part? Free hipster bikes to use in two-hour increments (just ask at the front desk)! These bikes are uber cute and are a powerhouse on the roads. After checking in, I immediately took one of these babies out and did a two hour ride along the trail following Lake Michigan. It's super close to the hotel and you can even ride the bike to the Zoo (which has free entry) and check out the animals. Great location.. I stayed in a suite and it felt really comfortable, hip and modern. The strange part was that it had two bathrooms (mine had one full and one half bathroom). First time that I've stayed in a hotel room with two bathrooms. I thought the bed was entirely comfortable, shower was nice and I enjoyed the couch in the room. It felt spacious and had a window view and an iDock which could be set to play "nature sounds," which I enjoyed since I could lounge in the chair, kick up some relaxing tunes and meditate for a while while looking out the window. Ohmm..yeah! :) The rooftop bar had some gorgeous views and lamp heaters at night. Elaine's Cafe has some great coffee and farm fresh eggs, house-cured salmon and healthy breakfast food. Second floor has a gym which is quite small (two treadmills, one elliptical, a bench and some weights), but useful for getting a work out in. They also had apples in the gym which I thought was a really nice small touch (and I totally ate some of them!). Staff was really friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable too. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
