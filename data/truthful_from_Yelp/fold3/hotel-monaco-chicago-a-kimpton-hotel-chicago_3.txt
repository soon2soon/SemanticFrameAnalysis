We stayed here for valentines day with our bulldog Ruby. This is our favorite hotel besides the trump. The rooms are welcoming and vibrant! every window in every room had the padded window tops and pillows and a gorgeous view! You can see how mich detail was put into decorating the rooms. I love it & thank you for the pleasant stay!
