Joyce is fabulous.  She is a wealth of Chicago knowledge and was excellent with the high school students I turned over to her.  Joyce Walks will be my source for any of my Chicago guide service needs, forever.  No need to question her ability and quality of her tours.  You won't want her tours to end.
