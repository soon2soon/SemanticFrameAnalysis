I just checked out of Hotel Cass (or Holiday Inn Express on Mag Mile) after a 5-day stay. BEST HOTEL IVE BEEN IN TO DATE! The pics on the website are what you get....its bit small, but very modern. Space is used effectively and in a single room, I had a nice size bed, desk, flat screen TV, and good size bath. Every was clean and the housekeeping staff was SO nice that I HAD to tip! Free internet (that was a big deal, as I have paid for internet everywhere else) that oyu can access from your room and not just the lobby. Valet parking for those that want it (its $44).Very friendly and helpful doormen. Breakfast was a STEAL! Not the same everyday, but there was always an fresh egg option, meat, fruit, cereal, juice, milk, coffee, lots of bread options (sweet rolls each day!) and yogurt. I never heard any other person in the other rooms, which is good for a high rise. The price was great to me, especially considering the price of the others in the area. Get high enough and you will get a good view, if on that side of the building. I would definately stay here again. I would come again and again, so consider highly if looking to staying in the Mag mile area!
