Fabulous Monaco is my favorite brand of hotel.  They all rock. This particular location has impressed me with how accommodating all the staff is.  Not unlike other Monaco's, but they seem to be just a bit more able to anticipate what I need/want/might like. A very well run property. Great location. Only knock with this Monaco, is that the restaurant attached to it is not nearly as good as all the other Monaco restaurants.  That's a separate review, and doesn't really impact how I look at this hotel,as the restaurant is fine, but just a few notches below where I think it should be. Cheers!
