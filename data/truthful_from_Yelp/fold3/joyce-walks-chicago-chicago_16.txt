Great tour. Just took the Mansions of Kenwood tour. It was great that a tour focused on a neighborhood that is not as well-known as other areas of Chicago. Our guide, Paula, had a real zest of the area -- she even gave us other sites to visit if we wanted to explore Kenwood further. She spent a good amount of time at each house, talking about the original owner, or the builder, or any famous resident. The group was small - six of us - so anyone could ask questions without slowing down the pace of the tour. She had researched each home, showing us pictures of the interior when possible or of the one-time owners. It was a two-hour walking tour and highly worth it.
