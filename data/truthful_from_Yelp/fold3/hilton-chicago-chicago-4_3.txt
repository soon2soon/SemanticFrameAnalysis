Great Chicago hotel with a good rate in a great location! However, BEWARE of parking costs!! $55/night self park and $69/night valet. We parked across the street for $25/night. We bumped up to executive room to get complimentary wifi and gym access...well worth the extra $30. We also requested renovated room which was awesome. Beds are super comfortable!! Nice sized bathroom. Hotel was within walking distance to great restaurants, parks and attractions. If it's warm enough I recommend walking everywhere because parking in the city is ridiculously high unless you luck up on street parking. Would stay here again!
