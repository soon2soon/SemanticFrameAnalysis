6 girls.  2 hours of sailing.  One too many Lime-A-Ritas. Sailed with Captain Justin (thanks to an awesome Living Social deal) just yesterday off of Monroe Harbor.  Extremely easy to find.  We should up 30 minutes early and the boat pulled up 20 minutes later.   Gorgeous boat.  Clean.  Great cushioned seating for six along with four cup holders by the boat's steering wheel.  We were allowed to bring snack, drinks (yes, booze is allowed), and our iPhones, iPads, and iPods worked on the boat's sound system.  There is a bathroom on board but no door to it so warn people when you go so no one walks in on you! During our two hour sail, we had constant view of Chicago's magnificent skyline.  We also sailed past Navy Pier before anchoring near the stony wall for swimming.  That's right, you get to jump off the boat and swim too!  Justin provided us with life jackets as well, for those who weren't too confident about their swimming skills. Justin organized the two hours well and gave us plenty notice when it came to the time we had left.  He'd say, "If you guys want to jump into the water again, this would be the time."  We never felt rushed and just had one of the most relaxing afternoons ever. Living Social deal or not.  I would definitely book with Just Sailing again in the near future.
