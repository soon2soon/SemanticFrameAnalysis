I found out about this serive through a Yelp Deal. I was traveling to NYC straight from work at 4:30am(I'm a night shifter), Â so I couldnt rely on the CTA, and I did not want to ride in a cab. So the yelp deal was an attractive offer. No problems with reserving a car(and arranging a pickup for my brother on the way). Sal got to my job 10 minutes early, and was pretty swift in getting us to the airport. Nice guy and not a single issue during my ride. There was a surcharge to pick my brother up($10), but that was agreeable thanks to the yelp deal savings. We still gave him a nice tip, seeing he got us to the gate before 5am. Good Service, and I recommend it for anyone going to either airport!
