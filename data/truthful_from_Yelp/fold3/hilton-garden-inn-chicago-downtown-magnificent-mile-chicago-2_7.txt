Spent 3 nights for the recent marathon. Great location and the red line of the subway was right out front. Next time we will take the subway from O'Hare rather than a cab. Hotel is clean. Fridge and microwave in room. There is a nice grocery store super close also. Also weber grill restaurant in hotel has good grub. Also felt safe walking around at night. Great neighborhood for restaurants and bars. Just 2 subway stops from millennium park. Hotel staff was super friendly. Definitely will return.
