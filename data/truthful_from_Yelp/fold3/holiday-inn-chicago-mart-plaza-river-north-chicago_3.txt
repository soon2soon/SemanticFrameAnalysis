I had an amazing stay at this location. We got in to town a little earlier than check in time, but we still were accommodated. Jay checked us into the hotel and was so friendly and welcoming. He treated us as if we were family. He gave us places to visit and off the beaten path restaurants to go to. He really made our experience in Chicago a memorable one. When we got up to the room the view was stunning and the room was very large and comfortable for two. Everything was well maintained and modern.
