Stayed here while my boyfriend was at a conference so I spent a LOT of time at the hotel.  The rooms were very nice, the staff was friendly and made good food recommendations, and the overall atmosphere was great.  There was a wine hour every evening which was a great way to meet other guests and talk about the things we've done in Chicago and just about life! Location was great.  It's cold this time of year and I was not happy walking in the 20 degree weather, but I did walk up and down the entire magnificent mile from the hotel, was able to walk to tons of restaurants for lunch and dinner (including a Starbucks around the corner in the morning) and did I mention all of the shopping? Internet was free BUT you have to sign up for their Kimpton Rewards program.  Definitely worth giving away your email address to avoid the charge, but I thought that was annoying. Overall, highly recommend and will be wanting to come back to Hotel Palomar next time I'm in Chicago!
