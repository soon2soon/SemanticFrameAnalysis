I took the tour of Pilsen when I had a friend in town and it was fantastic!  Even though I live in Chicago I rarely venture out of my neighborhood and this was a great way to get to know Pilsen a little more intimately.  Joyce is very knowledgeable and obviously loves what she's doing which makes the tour even more enjoyable.  I'm really looking forward to taking more of her tours and getting better acquainted with other Chicago neighborhoods! Thanks for a great Saturday morning, Joyce!
