Stayed here with my husband for our anniversary and had an excellent experience that started with some great service at check-in. A woman at the front desk (I believed Jerrell?) checked us in, and offered to check if I was a rewards member. Couldn't remember, so she looked us up, and BOOM! Free internet, starbucks cards, access to fitness center because I had signed up for rewards years ago for business travel. Â She was super kind and patient and didn't need to go the extra mile, but did. Room was beautiful, bed was insanely comfortable. Great view of the lake and michigan mile and the river. Visit the pool. I love to swim, and this is one of my favorite pools in the US. It's like a sanctuary for mermaids. Water is warm, tiles are green and cream and the stained glass windows overlooking the city make you feel like you're somewhere special, far away.
