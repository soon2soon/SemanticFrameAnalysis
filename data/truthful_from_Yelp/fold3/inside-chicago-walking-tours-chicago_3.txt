I've lived in this city for over ten years and have always wanted to do an architecture tour.  We have so much hidden history of which I know nothing about!  So I was thrilled with my experience with Inside Chicago Walking Tours.  Our tour guide, Hillary was personable, knowledgeable and made the tours fun!   Best part of the experience by far: being able to walk inside the buildings and hear more details and stories that I never would have known otherwise.  Living in Chicago, I pass these old historic buildings often and always wonder what's in there; too intimidated to wander in not knowing what's public access. So it was great having a guided tour from someone who knows where you can access those hidden historic gems in the city.  I left the tour feeling so proud of my hometown and its rich history!  Loved my first tour and excited to try other ones!
