Joyce gives walking tours of interesting neighborhoods and attractions in Chicago. I have taken her tour of both Pilsen neighborhood and the Maxwell Street area, and learned quite a bit of information on both. She carries a book full of old pictures, newspaper articles, etc. to fill in any gaps from the past to the present. She walks at a reasonable rate and is open to any questions from members of the tour group. I would not recommend her tours for small children, and some of them might be a little bit of a challenge for the disabled/elderly.
