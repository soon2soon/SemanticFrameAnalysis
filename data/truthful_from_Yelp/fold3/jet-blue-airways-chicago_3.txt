First time I flew Jet Blue was from HPN to MCO nonstop, and it was a really positive experience for my first time with them. The flight was on time, and not a bump of turbulence in the entire trip. You are, however, charged $25 per bag + applicable taxes. I like the fact that the Captain we had would give us frequent flight updates, and gave the passengers on the flight a verbal tour of New York City. He would tell the passengers on the right side and left side of the aircraft what they are seeing in the NYC skyline. I like the fact that you could choose your snack from the menu and the portions were better than what I'm used to on Southwest. DirecTV in the seat backs was great, and I was able to catch most of the UGA-Auburn game while in the air. That definitely ups their stock in my book! There was also a convenient flight tracker in the same TV screen where you could click over and see over what part of the country the jet current was flying, along with data like altitude and speed. The flight attendants were very nice and checked in on us with drink/snack refills multiple times during the flight. At the end of the flight, at the gate, the Captain personally said thank you to each departing passenger. I couldn't ask for a better experience, and Jet Blue may have my first and only 5 star rating for an airline. If you are in NY area and want a great non-stop down to Orlando, give Jet Blue a shot. You won't be disappointed. I really hope this airline doesn't get gobbled up by one of the bigger guys because they really have a good thing going.
