We contacted Janus Travel for our honeymoon - first to get an idea on the best destinations and secondly to get the best possible deals. We worked with Sue Tisza and she gave us a few options based on our criteria. She helped us select Aruba and she took every step to make sure all our requirements were covered before got there. Sue and Janus surprised us with a nice fruit basket when we got to our room in Bucuti Beach Resort! The resort was fantastic and credit to Sue for finding us the perfect honeymoon destination! Sue took care of all the planning for the trip (from flights, connections and transport from airport to the hotel)- which made it an absolute pleasure to work with her.
