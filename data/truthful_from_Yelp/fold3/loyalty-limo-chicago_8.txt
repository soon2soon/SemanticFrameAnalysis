From the start, Vince was very nice and willing to answer all of our questions. My parents were a bit concerned about their terms of service and Vince was willing to work with them on that and provide them the reassurance they needed that everything would run smoothly on our wedding day. Our driver Juan arrived early, was very nice and helpful, and got us to all of our destinations on time and safely. I can't thank them enough for everything they did to help our day run smoothly.
