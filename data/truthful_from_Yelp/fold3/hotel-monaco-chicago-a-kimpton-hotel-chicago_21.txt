I loved my stay in this hotel. I got upgraded to a King Suite and they have these wonderful bay windows that you could sleep in plus large jacuzzi tubs. The rooms are large, clean, and nicely decorated. They have free bike rentals and yoga equipment in every room as well as free workout videos on the computer. I love hotels that take away any excuse to not stay active while on business travel or vacation. The room service / food is pretty good also - they have chocolate chip cookies and milk as dessert! Note: if you stay at a Kimpton hotel, sign up for their free rewards program, you get free wifi and a $10 mini bar credit each time you stay, just for being a member.
