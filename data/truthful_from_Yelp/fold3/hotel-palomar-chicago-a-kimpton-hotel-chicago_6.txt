My girlfriend and I stayed the weekend here to celebrate her birthday and the run the Shamrock Shuffle. We stayed in the Mediterranean Spa room which had a two person whirlpool tub and a walk in shower. Water pressure was excellent and we never had an issue with running out of hot water. The room was very big and clean and came with a couch and coffee table, along with another chair and a desk. Staff was extremely friendly. All the lights in the room dimmed, even in the bathroom. There is a nice big seating area out in the front of the hotel with heat lamps and a large sitting room with a gas fireplace in the lobby where they hold a free cocktail hour every night. The pool area looked very nice but we never got the chance to swim because we forgot our swim suits. The only thing that we personally didn't like was the bed which was a lot firmer than we are accustomed to, the bathroom door slid closed with no locks, and there wasn't an exhaust fan in the bathroom. Unless I stumble across something better for the money, this will most likely be our choice of places to stay from now on when visiting the city. We didn't get the chance to eat at the hotel restaurant but will definitely try it out the next time we stay.
