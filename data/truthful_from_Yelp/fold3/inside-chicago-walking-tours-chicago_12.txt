We were visiting Chicago for the first time and decided to start our exploration of the city with a walking tour. Hilary's enthusiasm, depth of knowledge, and excellent presentation skills made the tour interesting, while her personality and playfulness made it fun. Not only did I learn all kinds of secrets about Chicago's history and see the city's buildings and architecture from a different perspective, I had a blast doing the Cupid shuffle in Daley Plaza and photo bombing a wedding party on the Magnificent Mile! Hilary leads a great tour. All you need to do is show up with some curiosity and a sense of adventure.
