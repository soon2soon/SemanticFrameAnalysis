With websites like priceline and expedia it seems travel agents are a lost form.  I've booked dozens of vacations on these, and similar, websites without thinking twice.  One day, while walking through 175 W. Jackson, I noticed Liberty Travel.  At the time I was researching spots for my honeymoon and, having no experience with travel agents, I decided I would at least get some information on how they work.  I was under the impression that there was a fee that the consumer paid for these services but I was wrong.  The hotels, etc, are the ones that pay the fee.   I met with Brian and he showed me a range of options in different locations and price points.  There wasn't a second that I felt like I was being "sold" or felt any pressure to purchase anything.   The trip was amazing and Brian was able to throw in a lot of "extras" that were not available online.  Since I booked that trip in March, we have used Brian on two other occasions, the most recent being for our trip to Mexico tomorrow.  After I booked my vacations I always used the sites referenced above to see if I could secure a better price myself.  All three times he had beaten the other sites rates by hundreds.  I will never book a trip on my own again. Give them a try; you have nothing to lose.  Ask for Brian.
