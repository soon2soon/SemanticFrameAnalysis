Hotel Lincoln is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago!  The staff is incredibly friendly and it is clear that your happiness is their top priority.  The ambiance is incredibly charming with a hipster vibe, eclectic for sure.  Hotel restaurant is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to...food was amazing!  Farm to table excellence! Also, there is a quaint coffee shop right in the hotel lobby.  Fitness Center is small but that is my only complaint.  Love this place!
