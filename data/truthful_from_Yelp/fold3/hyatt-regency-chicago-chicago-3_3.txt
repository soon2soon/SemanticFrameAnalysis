This is a very good hotel to stay at if you have a lot of things to do in the city the rooms are really big and decent size. the hotel is large enough to where you don't feel like you are on top of one another in the rooms are not tiny like every other hotel in the city. The location of the hotel is also perfect because you can get to many of the Chicago landmarks right from the hotel there not that far away from each other at all The parking rate is pretty decent compared to the other hotels in the city as well and they have a nice little bar area its a pretty cool spot to stay in when visiting the city of Chicago. I highly recommend this as a place to stay if you're going to be venturing out in the city and they have some great rates to and very reasonable for not only their parking rates but also the hotel rates and staff is always friendly and amazing.
