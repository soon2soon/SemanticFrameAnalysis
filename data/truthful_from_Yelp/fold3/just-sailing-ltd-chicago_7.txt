I bought a Living Social deal for Just Sailing, and it's probably been one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. Originally, I was going to use this as part of a bachelorette party, but bad weather screwed up our original plans. That actually is what put Justin and Just Sailing over and above. Within 24 hours of Â canceling, Justin sent an email with open times I could reschedule. We were able to go later that week, and it was incredible. First of all, I'd never been out on Lake Michigan, and it was really fun to see the city from the water. We were allowed to bring our own food and drink, which is just really convenient. The boat was comfortable and perfect for six people. Justin was a great captain! He would talk when we asked him questions, but didn't make it awkward when we were chatting amongst ourselves and not to him. This would definitely have been worth it had I paid full price, so to go for 50% off was an incredible deal. Just Sailing has not seen the last of me!
