I found In Chicago Car Service though Yelp, as we were looking for a new service for our Executive team in Chicago. We have been using them since summer 2013 and have nothing but positive things to say.   Yes, they may be slightly more expensive than regular car services, but they have been nothing but stellar; and I'm willing to pay a tiny bit more for reliability when it comes to our top Execs. They are always on time, are very accommodating with last minute requests,  and if there are any hiccups, they jump on it immediately to resolve the issue. This is the only car service name I have passed around to other businesses in Chicago, so keep up the good work In Chicago! Our Execs are hard to please sometimes, but they really like you!
