I fly about 75,000 miles a year and I wish Jet Blue flew more cites and more scheduled times in the cites it flies but all in all they are most service oriented Domestic Carrier in the USA. They give you a credit towards your next flight if the TV isn't working or if your flight is late. They offer more leg room and now for $15.00 more you even have mucho leg room. Your private TV or music, larger seats, free snacks and reasonably priced airfares, friendly staff, clean planes Service = 4.75 Stars Comfort = 4.50 Stars Free Snacks = 4.00 Stars Personal TV Â & Music = 5.00 Stars Cleanliness = 4.25 Stars Reliable Planes = 4.75 Stars Reasonable Pricing = 5.00 Stars Flight Schedules = 3.5 Stars
