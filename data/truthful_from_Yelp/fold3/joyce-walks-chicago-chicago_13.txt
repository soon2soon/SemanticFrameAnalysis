I heard about Joyce's tours through a "BuyWithMe" promo (they are similar to Groupon), and so far I've taken two tours with her: Maxwell Street Market and Pilsen.  Both of them did not disappoint. The Maxwell Street Market Tour was awesome. My husband and I met Joyce on a beautiful Sunday morning, and found out we were the only ones on the tour!  I always thought that tours had to have more people than that, but not with Joyce's tours. We really got to experience the market and the surrounding neighborhood at a nice pace-we never felt rushed or hurried. Joyce brought some great pictures of the former market days and told us about her own personal connection with the neighborhood.  It was really nice to get that added history to our experience. We took the Pilsen tour yesterday (this time with another couple, so again our group was small), and my husband and I did this tour at this time so that we could experience the neighborhood during the Halloween/Dia de los muertos holiday, and again I was very impressed.  Joyce really knew her stuff for this area too.  I have been in this area from time to time, and I never took the time to really see the area.  I now feel I know this neighborhood way better. We had a great mix of history, architecture, food, and murals/art. Plus with the holiday, the culture of this neighborhood came alive. She has several more off the beaten tourist path tours, and I know I already want to take her Chinatown tour. If you want to take a tour that's not mainstream, with a Chicago native who is honest of all of the changes to the city (both good and bad), and has a good mix of culture and history, check out her tours.  I think you will be very pleased. Thanks again Joyce!
