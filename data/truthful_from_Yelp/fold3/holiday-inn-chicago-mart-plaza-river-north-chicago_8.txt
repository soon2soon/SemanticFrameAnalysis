My solo weekend getaway to Chicago for the winter was great at the Holiday Inn at the Merchandise Mart. So convenient to travel to from O'hare especially when it's freezing cold. It's right in the corner of Michigan Ave so basically the beginning of The Loop where all the happenings are. All the staffs were very nice and informative. I'll definitely stay here again next time I visit the Windy City during better weather. Cityscape Bar which is where the lobby is on the 15th floor is a great place to wine down, a grab a quick bite and enjoy the view after your flight like I did!
