Very upscale & classy! Perhaps the best Hyatt hotel I've stayed at. Rooms are clean, non smoking (coz they'll charge you $250 for cleaning fee if you smoked in here), and free wifi. HDTV in my room, large desk and sparkly clean bathroom. Checking in was quick and easy. As i was getting out of the Airport Express shuttle, I was greeted by a friendly African American guy and reminded me that I am in Chicago! I forgot how most ppl in the Midwest really are this friendly! He asked if I needed help with my luggage but I was ok. One large suitcase for 5 days with plenty of room left inside- I did good!!! Learned that if you pack light while traveling, life is so much easier!!! I made reservations previously and all they asked for is my DL and a CC for incidentals. I made my way to the North tower elevators and arrived in my room without any difficulty. Quiet and clean hallway. Doors have card readers. Unlike other hotels, this one you scan your card or simply touch the reader with your card. There's a fridge, coffee maker, large desk, large mirrors and pristine bathrooms. Beds are so comfortable and signing on wifi is easy!!! Just what I needed after a long trip.
