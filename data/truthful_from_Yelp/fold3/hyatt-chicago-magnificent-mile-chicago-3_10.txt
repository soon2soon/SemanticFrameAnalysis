Highly recommend this hotel. Great location. Friendly staff. We were able to check in at 9am! When our flight was cancelled we were able to stay another night in our same room. This hotel is very trendy. The bar has signature cocktails. Girls.... Great lighting in the bathroom. I will stay here when I come back to Chicago!
