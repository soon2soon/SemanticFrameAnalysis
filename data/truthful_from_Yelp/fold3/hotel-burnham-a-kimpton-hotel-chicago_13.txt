Loved my stay here.  Kimpton never disappoints!  I liken the staff to that of a resort, where they remember you by name, and call to you by name as you pass through the halls or the lobby. The five star service is unlike any other hotel you find.  I travel a lot for work, and after being on the road for weeks at a time, sometimes the little things really make all the difference. The wine and coffee hours are of course always awesome, the room service quality and service is always phenomenal, and of course the little gems you find from staying in a boutique hotel make the stay exceptional (things like having real keys, or using a beach cruiser to get around town, or unique rooms that don't feel like a sterile hotel at any other chain) I can't wait to come back here!
