They did a great job.  I had been a little concerned when I booked the limo.  They didn't have a website or pictures, but everything went well so I felt I should write a good review for them. I called the day before I needed a Limo for 3 hours.  The price was fair and the guy who answered the phone communicated clearly.  They were 15 minutes early for both pickups.  Limo and driver were what I was expecting.
