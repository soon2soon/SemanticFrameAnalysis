We just got married here and it was amazing. Actually, every single person there said the whole day was perfect. Ceremony on the rooftop patio (now open in the winter!!!), brunch at Perennial, and guests stayed at the hotel. It was awesome, and every staff person was extremely nice and helpful. Every photo we took, from the roof views, the fun lounge on the second floor, and brunch were perfectly lit and totally unique. Thank you Hotel Lincoln!!
