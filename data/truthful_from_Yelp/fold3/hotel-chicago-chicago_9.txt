I had seen several reviews that almost shied me away from this hotel, but a friend insisted I stay here so I decided to try it out. I absolutely loved it! They had a free printer and computer access which I needed last minute. They were always quick to say here let me do this for you. They always emailed me instantly in regards to the things I preplanned and ordered. They were quick to always answer my questions. They blew me away with their customer service. I thought the room and view were wonderful! They made sure to personally email me about what time I needed special requests done in the room that I had surprised planned for my significant other.
