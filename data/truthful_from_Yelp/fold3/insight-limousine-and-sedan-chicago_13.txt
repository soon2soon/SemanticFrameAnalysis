I used Insight Limo for a bachelorette party of 9 girls last weekend.  Jorge was FABULOUS!  It doesn't get better than the service we received.  He was kind, attentive, and the limo was absolutely gorgeous.  He even bought us all McDonalds Happy Meals at the end of the night...exactly was a group of girls who has been drinking for 6 hours needed! I cannot recommend him enough.  Really exceeded my expectations.
