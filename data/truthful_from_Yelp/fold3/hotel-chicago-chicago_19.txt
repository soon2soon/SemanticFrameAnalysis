I stayed here about a year ago for a company party in Chicago. The accommodations were chosen and paid for by my place of work, so I can't comment on the price but I fell in love with the hotel's quirky aesthetic. There were a lot of romantic and gothic elements, but with a modern edge. The lobby was small, clean, but elegant. The rooms themselves are filled with funky decor like faux-snakeskin chairs and brocade wallpaper with silhouette stickers. The bathrooms, for the record, are also pretty huge and have heat lamps. I really liked that the hallways were dark, it was almost like exploring a large but quiet manor. The one thing I'm not sure what to think of is the Crimson Lounge. In one sense, it kind of looks like the Twilight books exploded in there. Red velvet couches with grotesque details, dark lighting and chandeliers, etc... On the other hand, it's a pretty cool and swank place without being an obnoxious hotel night club with trashy neon lights. I also heard a rumor that Samantha Ronson spins there on occasion.
