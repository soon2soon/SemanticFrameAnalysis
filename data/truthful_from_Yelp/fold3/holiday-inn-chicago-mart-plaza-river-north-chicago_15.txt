My daughter's wedding reception was held this month at the WolfPoint ballroom in the Mart Plaza. Â It could not have been more perfect. The room was beautiful with lovely linens, centerpieces and table placement. The food was superior, especially considering we had 275 attending. Service was great, staff was attentive and went above and beyond to satisfy our needs. Bonita and Janet were great to work with, showed compassion and flexibility , were willing to work with us on every little detail. I can't thank them enough for making our evening a dream come true! Only negative was the wait time to get into our hotel rooms on Thursday before the wedding. Even tho , check in is at 3, most of us could not get into our rooms until 3:30 or later. As our rehearsal was at a different site at 4:30, we were quite rushed. No explanation was given, just that rooms were not ready yet.
