I stayed here one night this summer and two nights this weekend. I highly recommend it. It is in a great location, I love staying in this part of town. The rooms are nice. They beds are comfortable. There is a couch in the room. The bathroom is big. The shower is hot. The toilet flushes. Ok, I'm droning on now. But seriously the rooms are comfortable and even big enough for six people to hang out in and everyone had a seat. If you can, upgrade to a room with a view. The window is huge and you actually do get a decent view. I was on the sixteenth floor and I had a great view of Trump Tower and when the fog lifted a little bit, I could even see the Sears Tower for five minutes. I would definitely stay here again.
