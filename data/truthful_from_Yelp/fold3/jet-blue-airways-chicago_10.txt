I've flown Jetblue over the years and have always been happy but my most recent experience was the best I've had yet. I booked a flight to Chicago on one of their new E-190 planes and I couldn't have been happier. My biggest complaint on any plane I fly is legroom-most planes are flat out uncomfortable to sit in for any more than 15 minutes. This flight though was amazing-plenty of legroom for a change in a comfy seat in a new and clean plane that was quiet. Additionally, you get unlimited snacks and they have a great selection of channels to watch on your own TV. Combine this with friendly service and a low price and you have a real winner. Southwest may be friendly too, but they don't have as much seat room, the planes are old and dingy, there's no TV and snacks are limited. As far as I'm concerned Jetblue has no competition if they fly where you need to go.
