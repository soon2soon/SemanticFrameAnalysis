I mistakenly showed up at the Jetblue check-in desk because I had not looked at my itinerary recently! I just know that I like to fly Jetblue if it fits with my schedule and price. I was actually flying a different airline, in a different terminal, with less than an hour to checkin, and had to check 2 large pieces of luggage. I am capable of carrying the luggage but the trek and time pinch required a push-cart. The jetblue check-in employee (a woman) was more than helpful as she saw that I was disorganized and in a rush. She was nice, helpful, and did not take it personally that I was flying a different airline. This experience will add to the reasons why I always check jetblue before I check any other airline or airline database. If Jetblue's timing and price work for me then I am booking the ticket.
