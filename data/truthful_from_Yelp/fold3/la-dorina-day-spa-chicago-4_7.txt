I purchase a coupon for a no chip manicure and because my other bad experiences I Â check reviews first. The place is small but cozy and the sisters are very nice. Jenny took care of me and she did an excellent job, it has been 3 weeks already and no chips!!! Thank you so much Jenny, you now have a customer for life!!!
