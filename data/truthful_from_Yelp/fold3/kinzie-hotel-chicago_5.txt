Got an absolute steal for this place on Groupon.  Just got back yesterday, and wish we could've stayed longer!  This is one of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed at.  It's in a great area, right off the Magnificent Mile and close to all manners of transportation.  They have cookies and Keurig drinks at the front desk all afternoon, free drinks and appetizers every eveing (although we missed that part), and a great free breakfast on every floor in the morning.  The breakfast was especially great because we just got our food and brought it back to eat in bed :) The whole hotel is just super trendy and cute.  It's exactly my style.  The beds were really comfortable, the bathroom was adorable, the bath products were great (they even have shower gel instead of just a bar of soap!), and there are two shower heads in the shower!  There is also a minifridge (that you can actually keep stuff in- they don't fill it with stuff they're trying to sell you).  Oh, and free wi-fi, which should be a given in all hotels, but since it's not, is worth mentioning. Loved everything about this place.  Keep up the Groupon deals so I can come back :)
