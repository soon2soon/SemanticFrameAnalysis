Had a fantastic stay here last weekend.  The lobby and rooms are very nicely decorated, not in the typical dated, stuffy hotel fashion.  The location cannot be beat!  The staff were excellent.  We're sorry we didn't have a chance to check out the rooftop lounge.  We booked a junior sweet, which had a king bed, sofa, plenty of space, and TWO BATHROOMS!  I was not expecting that, and it was an awesome surprise.  We had a city view, and it was indescribably beautiful on the first night with hazy sky.  We were in town for an event at the zoo, which was just a quick walk across the street.  As much as I appreciated this place in the winter, it will be that much more awesome in nice weather.   I am usually not a repeat customer anywhere, just because I love to try new places, but I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else on my next visit.
