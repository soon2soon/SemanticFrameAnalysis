My wife and I had the most delightful five-night stay at the Hotel Lincoln in Chicago. Super location. Charming. Comfortable. Yet (very) reasonably priced. We are from Mill Valley, CA (near San Francisco). With the help of Annaliese, the hotel's reservations person, we reserved three Hotel Lincoln rooms: A one-bedroom suite. A Jr. Suite. And one single room. The rooms were clean, comfortable and affordable; the beds were luxurious. The occasion: A small family birthday reunion. The Hotel Lincoln made our granddaughter's sixteenth birthday a huge success. In the room were flowers and a handwritten "Happy Birthday" note from the staff. How cool was that! We appreciated the entire staff. Including the guys in front hailing cabs for hotel guests. Special thanks to front desk Alyssa, Sarah, Ben and Fabien. And a "Thumbs-Up" thank you to Annaliese. She set the stage for our family's first visit to Chicago and helped make possible a wonderful and memorable five-day Chicago experience! Hotel Lincoln, Chicago. We're coming back!
