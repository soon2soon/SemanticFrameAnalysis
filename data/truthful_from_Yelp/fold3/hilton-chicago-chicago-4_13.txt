Weary from battling traffic in a snow storm, we were heartened to experience such warm and efficient welcome during the checking in process. Our room was well appointed with a sitting area separate from the King Size bed. We spent the evening with 600+ for a company function in the main ballroom. Loved the restored 1920s Â chandeliers, balconies and edifices. Waitstaff could not have been more attentive, as they introduced themselves by name at the beginning of the evening and throughout the time checked in to see if everything was just the way we liked it. The food was delicious and served hot, courses timed perfectly.
