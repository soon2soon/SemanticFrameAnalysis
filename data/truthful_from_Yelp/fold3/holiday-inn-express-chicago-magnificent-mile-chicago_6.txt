Great hotel, full of historic character.  This was my second stay at the Holiday Inn Express and the staff was as delightful as could be.  The greeting at the door as well as the desk staff, housekeeping and breakfast made you feel right at home.  ***A little known fact - valet parking here is one of the cheapest in downtown**** I chose to stay here for the location.  It was right in the middle of everything, but far enough away that it is nice and quite.  Walk a block or two and you are right on Michigan Ave. The rooms were very clean, housekeeping did a great job to make sure that we had everything we needed.  A little note: the windows open both top and bottom.  Our top window was just barely cracked the first night making the room really noisy when sounds would echo though the streets.   The amenities were wonderful.  I love Holiday Express for the breakfast.  Omelettes and Cinnamon Rolls...what more could someone needs.  Well, they had a lot of other offerings as well, but those two had me excited.  They had one of the best business centers I have seen at a HIE with three PC's and multiple printers. Overall, great experience in a quaint, updated, yet historical hotel.
