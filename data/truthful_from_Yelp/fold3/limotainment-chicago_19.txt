We used Limotainment to shuttle the wedding party around for photographs for our wedding on November 2nd.   I sent Mike an initial email about 6 months prior to the wedding, and he responded promptly and answered all of my questions.  That same professionalism carried out in all of our correspondence up until the wedding date. On the day of the wedding, the limo bus was clean and stocked with alcohol. They arrived 10 minutes early, and called me to let me know they had arrived and to take our time.  Mike and our driver were professional and courteous.   Mike acts as a "concierge" and worked with our photographers to get us to the locations, and waited on the side of the road while we took pictures.  He even helped the girls get out of the bus.   It was a chilly day, and it was nice to have a warm limo bus to get back to in between pictures. Overall, I would highly recommend Limotainment for a great, stylish ride and professional service.   One less thing for a bride to worry about!
