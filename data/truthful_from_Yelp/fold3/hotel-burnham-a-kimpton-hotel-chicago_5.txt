The hotel provides such a nice experience for its guests. On a cold winter day, we were greeted at check in with hot cocoa and marshmallow and chocolate chips and peppermint chips. Nom nom. Our room was on the top floor (15). It was a BIT small but fine for 2 people. It was clean and really a nice space. A complimentary bottle of champagne arrived in our room 5 minutes after we got in. What a nice surprise. We checked out the gym (as in.... Walked by and swore id go later) and it was a little disappointing. They have the basics but was also just sub par. Overall, wonderful service, staff rocks it, the restaurant downstairs is good and they make sure every guest leaves satisfied. I was really impressed.
