Beautiful hotel with gorgeous views of the city if you have a southern view. We enjoyed our stay here,everything was well maintained. They have a great breakfast array, a small coffee shop inside as well as a restaurant. There is also a really great full sizes gym and lap pool. The only downside is the parking is not free and there is not much to walk to in the area. It is really close to the Lake which is nice if you're coming in the summertime. Overall very nice stay, will come back!
