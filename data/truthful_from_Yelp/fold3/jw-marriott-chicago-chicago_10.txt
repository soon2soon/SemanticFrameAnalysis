My boyfriend surprised me and took me here Christmas night for two nights. It's a beautiful hotel and all of the staff was very polite and efficient but one member in particular made this stay memorable, his name was Joe. Joe helped us from our car to the desk and then our room and was the nicest guy ever! If I were an undercover boss I would have bought this guy a house! He was so sick and still worked on xmas and was very attentive. I gave him an emergen-c packet after I noticed him sniffling and coughing and he turned around and had an amazing bottle of wine and cheese plate sent to our room for my bday. It was so incredibly nice of him!! Thanks Joe, not only for your amazing service but making me feel special on my bday!
