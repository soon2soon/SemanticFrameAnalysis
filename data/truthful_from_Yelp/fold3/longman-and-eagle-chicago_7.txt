Quick Hit: My Absolute Favorite Restaurant in Chicago *This review is based on 10+ visits, for both brunch and dinner, at L&E I could write an extensive review encapsulating the awesomeness of all that is Longman & Eagle, but to save me from carpal tunnel syndrome I will sum it up in a simple equation. (Food/Drink): --High end, innovative, Michelin-starred cuisine (check my food pics, yes 27 of them, sorry) --Extensive drink menu (WHISKEY BAR) + (Atmosphere): --Down-to-earth, hipster, laid-back ambience + (Service): --Unpretentious, flannel-clad waitstaff with excellent food/drink knowledge = Longman & Eagle Eat here (seriously). Drink here (obviously). And you can even stay here (they have a few hotel rooms). You won't be disappointed.
