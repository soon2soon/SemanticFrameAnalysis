We arrived four hours earlier than check in time, and they happily gave us a room, which is a plus so that's one star! The room was clean and want impressed me the most are the spacious of the room and also the living room for you to relax and chit chatting. That's a two stars And from the front desk to the kitchen .. Everyone are so pleasing and accommodate. That's three stars And the best part of all was the breakfast FREE breakfast! With scrambled eggs, ham and bacon with sausage gravy... Also fruits, cereals and fruit juices. Don't forget 6 different kinds of tea and 3 different Â type of coffee. That's will be the two stars! So all total 5 stars! We will be back for sure if we are back to Chicago !
