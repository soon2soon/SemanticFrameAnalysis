This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago.  Way cheaper than any hotels in the loop, the location is perfect, the staff is friendly and the other guests have always been respectful and quiet.  It's important to bring your own lock so you can secure your stuff in a locker, and they server a light breakfast for free everyday.  They have a kitchen on every floor if you are staying for awhile and want to cook your own food.  Some rooms have a bathroom in them, but there are bathrooms on every floor with showers, etc.  The rooms are always clean, and there are plenty of blankets, power outlets and whatever else you need while your traveling.  You can't beat it, as long as you are OK sharing a room with 3-7 other mostly quiet, respectful people.
