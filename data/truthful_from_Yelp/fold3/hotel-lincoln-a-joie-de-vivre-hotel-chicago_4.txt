Stayed here for an extended weekend for a wedding and you could not ask for a better hotel. Â Location is great - right by the zoo and a 10 minute walk to their beach area for those staying here during the spring/summer. No problems with the free wifi, very clean - great helpful staff - and the cafe on the bottom floor serves la colombe coffee - can't ask for anything more.
