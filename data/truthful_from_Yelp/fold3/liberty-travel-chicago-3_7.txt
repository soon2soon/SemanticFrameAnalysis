I accidentally posted this same review on another username I created but here it goes: When I'm looking to finalize my travel plans I turn to Alison Vargas at Liberty Travel. She always seems to find a very reasonable itinerary at a great price-even at the last minute. Searching online now-a-days can be such a hassle so she saves me time and money! Alison is very attentive, professional, friendly, and she always recommends the best hotels to stay at. I recommend booking your travel with Alison!
