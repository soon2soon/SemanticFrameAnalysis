I have stayed here a few times in the past 2 years both times I got good rates from priceline at the last minute. They get good points for having Weber Grill which is awesome for meat and other dishes. Most importantly is even if you are not staying here and you are on your way to the train station and you need to go to the can, ( when you got to go you got to go) their bathrooms are immaculate and clean. What else do you need ? Definitely in the top 10 wash rooms in the city in what I refer to as the George Costanza best washroom award: youtube.com/watch?v=JYVBâ€¦
