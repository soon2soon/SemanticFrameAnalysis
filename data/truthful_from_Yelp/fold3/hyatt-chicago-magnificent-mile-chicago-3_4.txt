I came in to this hotel with very high expectations, having stayed just about a week prior at the Hyatt Herald Square in NYC (an amazing hotel, check it out!) and I am pleased to say I was not disappointed. The hotel's common areas had a modern feel and seemed to encourage spending time there with co-workers or friends. The food was delicious (When was the last time you could say that about a hotel bar?), especially the Tuna Tartare, and the waitstaff was friendly and helpful. The turndown service was a bit aggressively helpful... "No, really I'm ok. Thanks for asking though!" but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I can't comment on the standard rooms, as I received a Diamond Status Suite Upgrade, but the suite was awesome. It had a very modern look/feel yet was comfortable. The bathroom was of a slightly odd design, but in a high-rise you don't always get to move a structural column to "open up" a room. I was initially concerned because it was on a low floor and my two room requirements are clean and quiet. Yet, despite being near street level, the room was quiet enough that I slept very well. A special shout out should go to the front desk staff and the in room dining staff who were concerned and helpful and brought me soup when I cam down with a 24-hour flu while staying there. It felt like they truly cared about the wellbeing of their guests, and not just from a liability standpoint. I will most definately stay here again, and bring co-workers, next time I have a work activity in our downtown office.
