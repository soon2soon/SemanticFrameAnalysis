My  daughters and  I (and our dog) Stayed in the Mediterranean Spa Suite at t the Hotel Monaco lasts month for a little winter "staycation."  The 2-room suite was big and very nicely decorated. It had 4 window seats  which were each the size of a double bed!   We faced the Chicago River, so we got some good pics of the view, although a  higher floor would have been nice. We picked Hotel Monaco primarily because of its "pet-friendly" policy.  No extra fees or deposit required to bring along our dog, Penny. They just had us  sign an agreement to take care of any damage caused by her.  They had a  treat bag with snacks, a small tennis ball and poop bags waiting for her when we checked in. We saw 2-3 other dogs in the lobby and most guests seemed pleasantly surprised to see a few dogs staying at the hotel. In the evening, they had a nice wine tasting hour in the lobby with 2-3 types of wine, hot cider and hot toddies. Tthey had coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the morning.  It happened to be a very cold couple of days, so the warm drinks were appreciated. There is a stocked mini-fridge in the room and, as "In Touch" members, we received a $10 raid the mini-bar credit.  (Of course it only bought 2 items, but it was a nice gesture) We bought our own reasonably priced drinks & snacks at Target - a few blocks south -and put those in the mini-fridge.   The bathroom was large and had a  jacuzzi tub, but it was loud and took a while to fill. Separate shower was nice. We really enjoyed Hotel Monaco and will definitely  return when the weather is better.
