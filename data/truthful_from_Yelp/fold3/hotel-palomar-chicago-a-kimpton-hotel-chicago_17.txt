Hubby & I recently celebrated our anniversary here and I must say that everything went beautifully! I would equate it to a Boutique type of hotel... not what I normally see in Vegas :-) Loved it! From the staff to the accommodations they offer to the lovely room and facilities. We stayed in an upgraded room high up w a lovely view... the rate was higher, of course, however,  we were celebrating.   The hotel also offers a very, very good restaurant to dine in downstairs... Sable Kitchen... we dined there twice, actually. The gym is fully equipped w fresh water and fruit depending on when you go. They also have a lovely pool, however,  we packed more for winter. Did not use it. In the lobby at 5-6 they offer Happy Hour... we missed it every single day since we were busy sightseeing all day :-/ However, we made up for it outside. They also offer lemon water in the Lobby! All in all the people of the Midwest are pretty neat people always willing to lend a hand. Check it out if you are visiting Chicago. It is literally within walking distance to Everything!!! Great spot to make your base! Btw, they offer 20% off deals at certain times. Your constant companion, ~ deirdra
