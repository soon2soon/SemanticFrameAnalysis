Great hotel! Right in the middle of downtown with a Trader Joe's across the street on one side, and Bloomingdale's on the other. The staff could not have been nicer, specifically the GSM, Fran. He had our room ready to go even though we got there a few hours before normal check-in and was always quick to say hello and ask how our day was. Breakfast was great, I loved the way the lobby/breakfast area was set up, definitely more of a home type feel than other HIE's I've stayed at. I know everyone talks about how small the rooms are and honestly, the rooms are not that small, guys. Its hotel in a big city in an old building and there is AMPLE enough room for 2 people to store their stuff and get ready for a night out. We requested a fridge and microwave and we STILL had room to spare. The bed was really comfy and there was a nice padded bench on one wall that was great for storage. The curtains helped to not only shield sun but to keep the room insulated from the cold, and I would assume will do the same with the heat in the summer. All in all, very functional and nicely decorated. AND walking distance to the Red Line L Train which was absolutely amazing. I will DEFINITELY stay here again on my next trip to Chicago.
