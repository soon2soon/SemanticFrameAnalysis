Love this hotel!  Right in the heart of downtown with easy access to the red line train only a block away.  Within walking distance of some great restaurants too!   Don't want to venture out to eat for dinner and don't want to order-in?  Don't worry.  The hotel has a dinner buffet Monday - Thursday nights.  The food can be hit or miss (for example, the last time that I was there the brisket and the chicken were decent, but the pizza was a fail.  Granted, it is Chicago so it is acceptable to have certain standards for pizza).   The bed is super comfortable, too, so you don't have the problems of "hotel sleep" where you constantly wake up and sleep like crap.  The full kitchen was great too. The only complaint that I have is one day after the room was cleaned the cleaning staff only left ONE of those little hotel chiclet pillows on the bed.  Looked kind of silly to have one tiny pillow in the middle of a king sized bed.  A quick phone call to the front desk fixed that problem.   Oh, and the doormen were awesome.  Need a taxi to go somewhere?  They are all over it for you and super friendly, along with the rest of the staff.
