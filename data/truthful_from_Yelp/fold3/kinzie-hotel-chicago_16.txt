Wow - what a great hotel. I was impressed from the moment we pulled up to the doors.  We were greeted and our bags were taken inside for us upon arrival.  We were also offered water while we check in (traveling always makes me thirsty, this was a really nice perk). Hotels are hotels for the most part, but this particular one is very chic and freshly remodeled into totally gorgeous and trendy rooms, halls, and lobby.  Dark blues, grey wallpaper and fancy mirrors make it a little romantic, too. My party of 4 comfortably fit into a room with two queen beds.  The staff willingly and graciously brought us extra towels. blankets and soaps upon request. Biggest benefits of this hotel: -location, close to everything touristy and non-touristy you could possible desire.  About a $40 cab ride from Midway or two blocks from the Orange line if you prefer to take the train. -Free WiFi. -Free breakfast on every floor, you don't have to wait in line for the entire hotel to try to eat.  This was a huge benefit, so convenient. -Two free cocktails and snacks during the managers reception, weekdays from 5-8.  Make sure to bring your ID with you though, they do card you...and don't forget to tip. -Super friendly staff. -Easy check-out. Quick tip - Women's restroom is on the 6th floor, Men's is on the 5th.  Which is really nice if you happen to find yourself sharing a room with 3 other girls and need to use the bathroom when someone is using the one in your room. Can't wait to see you again Kinzie Hotel.
