Stayed here one night while I was in town for something at the University of Chicago. It has a convenient location and is newly built so has all new amenities and rooms with a pretty decent rate. I was able to get a double with two queens for quite cheap. The room has a large tv, a large corner couch which makes it feel spacious and very accommodating for a variety of group sizes. The staff was very friendly both during check in and in answering my questions about transportation or any items I needed. The courtesy continental breakfast has a great variety from oatmeal to cereal to fresh fruit and eggs Benedict and waffles. Seating is kinda of limited as it's in the middle of the small lobby but not much of a big complaint. Definitely highly recommend if you need to stay in this area! The surrounding shops are sparse as it's mainly residential but there are a couple convenient stores and some shopping around.
