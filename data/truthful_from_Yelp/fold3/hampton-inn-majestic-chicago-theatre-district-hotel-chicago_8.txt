I stayed here for a week while I was on a business trip. This hotel was great. Every day my room was cleaned with fresh sheets. The continental breakfast was good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect. Right in The Loop and in between the Blue Line and Red Line. This makes getting to and from O'Hare extremely easy. You can grab the Orange line a short walk away to get to and from Midway. The Red Line will take you to Wrigley Field or to US Cellular Field so you can catch a Cubs or Sox Â game. The Art Institute and Millennium Park are short walks as well. My only request would be faster internet speeds. It was a little slow for my taste. However, it was free so I can't complain about that. It served it's purpose and I was able to do work and check email. Great hotel for the price and location. Can't beat it.
