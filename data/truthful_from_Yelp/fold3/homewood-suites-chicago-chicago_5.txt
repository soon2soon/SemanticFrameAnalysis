This is a well situated hotel to go to different attractions. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The valet is quick and friendly.... Very cheerful even when people are rudely grumbling (as I witnessed a woman being obnoxious no matter how friendly the valet is!!). The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable! The housekeeping staff do a very good job! The kitchen is supplied with utensils, plates and cups. It even has microwave containers. The room is equipped with a stove, full refrigerator and dishwasher. Breakfast is served every morning on the 6th floor (same floor where the front desk is) with a good selection of food. Dinner in M-Th evenings with wine. The hotel is kid friendly. The roll out bed was great for my 11 and 8 year old. Walking distance to many eateries and restaurants with a mall across the way. Walking distance from the Loop. Dominick's or Jewel Osco. The hotel is quiet. The exercise room and pool is on the 19th floor. The facilities are clean and inviting. My kids swam 3 of the 5 nights that we were here! The except use room is good for cardio, dumbbells (up to 50#) and an whole body cable... I will definitely stay here again.
