My (almost) 3 year old son and I checked into this B&B and immediately fell in love!  He truly enjoyed all the kid cable channels and snacks and drinks.  I loved the beautiful decor, artwork, comfy bed, steam shower in the room and great coffee every morning.  This is a beautiful, comfortable and no-hassle place to stay. We will stay here next time we visit our friends in Chicago.
