The Ritz, it should go without saying, is wonderful. If you're looking here in the first place, you are already after a pretty swanky experience. Having stayed both here and its cousin down the street makes for an interesting comparison. The Ritz is far and away more economical (if you can call anything economical in this category)--we have gotten far swankier rooms here for about a third less than they would cost at the Four Seasons. That price difference, of course, has to be made up somewhere--Allium is a much better restaurant than deca, and the service here sometimes does not have the same attention to detail it does down the street. I have mostly noticed this at the valet stand and the thoroughness with which rooms are cleaned--the concierge and front desk do not suffer at all (and are probably much warmer and friendlier here). Overall? Both have their high points. But I think in terms of bang for your buck, the Ritz is a clear winner.
