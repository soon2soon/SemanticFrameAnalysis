We had our wedding ceremony and reception at Crowne Plaza Wonderful location and venue. Reasonably priced, great attention to detail. They took fantastic care of us and our wedding reception. They did nice things like kept my flowers in the cooler for us over night, collected the arrangements that we were keeping and many other very thoughtful details. I was a bit let down by the meal. I don't feel like it was quite the quality of a meal that we had at our tasting. But everyone said they thought the meal was great even the best friends said yes when we double asked them the day after. And that's what really counts! Our upgraded room was wonderful and clean. Nice bed and bedding. Champagne and sparking cider in the room set out to perfection when we got to our room. The event manager even took my gum from me when I went into the ceremony, she was all around wonderful, responsive and knowledgeable. The catering manager was communicative and top notch. We had a vegetable and cheese tray during cocktails and they were fabulous. The location is great, close to the vibe of the city but not in the mix. Half a block from the expressway it was convenient for out of town and suburban guests. We were "very" pleased wit our wedding ceremony and reception. "Thank you Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro for a wonderful event."
