Room= great. Staff = great. Valet = great. A bit pricey but you get in/ out privileges. Housekeeping = AWESOME! She brought us bags if ice for our in-room bachelorette pre gaming! And we partied like rock stars- seriously the next morning the room looked like a heavy metal band partied there. Roof (club upstairs) = LAME. Can't pin point if it was the ppl, atmosphere, DJ or what but barely anyone was dancing! Boo! Hotel itself has a younger crowd and I know host a lot of bachelor/ rstate parties on the weekend so prob best not to bring the kiddies to this one.
