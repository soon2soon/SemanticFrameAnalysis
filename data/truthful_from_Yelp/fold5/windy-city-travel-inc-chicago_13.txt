I have been using Windy City and Janet since 2006 when she recommended a resort for my destination wedding and booked over 20 people for flights and for the resort. The experience was so pain free that I have been back twice since. First, Janet booked a honeymoon for me to the Dominican Republic and most recently to Couples Negril in Jamaica. On both trips Windy City made special requests to obtain for us the best possible rooms, and in each attempt, they were succesful. For our last trip to Jamaica I was pleasantly surprised that Janet managed to get us a $175 spa credit and a $75 gift shop credit. Another couple we were there with who went through a different travel agent did not get this deal. I will also add that Janet always books us on non stop flights to our destinations which is a huge bonus. In sum, I have always recieved prompt and courteous service from Windy City, and would not hesitate to recommend them to family and friends.
