This is probably one of the most indulgent and expensive experiences that I've had in my life. Â I came here for a Valenetine's Day stay and it was fantastic. There is probably nothing better than cuddling next to a fireplace on a cold winter's day. While I was here I also got a chance to enjoy that they has a great car service. When I was leaving the hotel to ask for a taxi, I was pleasantly surprised when they pulled around a Mercedes to take us to our event at the MCA. I will say the lighting scheme is a little complicated at first try but once you get used to it is actually quite nice. They also have a port where you can hook up your iPhone into the sound system. I would have liked to see a standard 3.5mm audio jack as I don't also don't own an iPhone. They also have the connection for the older style of iPhone so if yours has a lightning connection you are going to need an adapter. Though I'm not sure the front desk may have one. If I was looking for a totally indulgent experience. This is the place to go.
