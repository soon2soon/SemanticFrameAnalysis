My friends and I were in town for a girls weekend and did the taste of Chicago tour. It was one of our highlights of our trip!! Amazing food tried at all locations! We learned a lot of Chicago history too! Our guide was Johnson and he did a great job!! He was very attentive to the group, entertaining, and made the tour fun!
