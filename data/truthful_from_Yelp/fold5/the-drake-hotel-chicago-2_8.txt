We stayed here over the Christmas holiday season. I think about this place a lot, especially when I crave to return to Chicago for a holiday. I love the history, opulence, class and style of this place. It is not a tacky, stinky hotel in which every room looks (and smells) the same. The bed is comfortable with thick, lush bedding. The staff is professional and go above and beyond to please the guests. The Drake is perfectly located close to entertainment, shopping and views...
