Super fun boat and tour around the lake. We went on the Pirate tour, which when we found it online we were very intrigued. Pirates on the Great Lakes?! really, it just seemed so bizarre. We're from Houston, Texas and my husband has some pretty notorious pirates in the family, the Lafittes. Which if you know a little about it, Disney based their "Pirates of the Caribbean" ride on Jean Lafitte, you even see his name plastered near the end of the ride, even though it's not spelled correctly. Of course the four Pirate movies were based on the ride. So yes a little investment in pirate history, we even took our engagement pictures at the old Lafitte hideout in Galveston. Got a lot of fun history on pirates of the Great Lakes, mostly on Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac. The bar was a great highlight as well. It kept my husband happy, who I mostly had to pull on the boat because of his great fear of water. Once he had some beers, he was much better and could really enjoy it. The only problem with going to the bar was that someone else was surely lose your prime seat to someone else.
