I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and a fair number of 5 star hotels, in a variety of places, and the Langham certainly is at the top of my list so far. I was greeted immediately when I came in, and advised to go to the Club level to check in.  I hopped on the elevator and was met by the butler team who checked me in, gave me a glass of water, and basically made me feel like a rock star. The rooms are amazing.  Just amazing.  Every detail is covered, down to having a seated vanity area with a lighted make up mirror, slippers and robes in the closet, various lighting choices in the room, a privacy screen in the shower, outlets just where you need them, and an amazingly comfortable bed.  I also applaud anyone who designs a hotel with the toilet and shower in separate places.   The gym is also fantastic, although I wished they open at 5:00am.  Great spa facilities. The staff is outstanding.  There is not doubt that they are here to make your stay comfortable and complete.   Location is desirable, in my opinion.  You are so close to downtown, and just a short cab ride from Shedd, Soldier Field, etc.   I will definitely be coming back with my husband to enjoy a romantic weekend away in sunny downtown Chicago.  In the summer, of course.
