Pretty awesome experience.  I'm not a huge tour person, but this was a great intro to the buildings of Chicago.  The weather was great, although we went just as the sun was going down, so it was tough for the first 15 minutes or so, as we were sailing right into the sun.  Not the boat's fault though... The tour guide was this ridiculous lady with a huge 'Sconie accent.  But she was super authentic and entertaining.  Certainly knows her stuff.  All the tour guides are volunteers, so they really want to be there and tell you all they know. Overall, a great time!
