We made the reservation for St. Patty's Day weekend solely due to the convenience in location and definitely hit the jackpot with the hotel. Our experience started off on the right foot once we pulled up to the front of the hotel and were greeted by the bellman, Al, who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed, including recommendations as to where we should go out that night. Our room was perfect for us- a king bed and a pull out couch were perfect for the 3 of us for the weekend. Our group got drinks at the rooftop bar both before dinner the first night and for brunch the next day and have nothing but positives to say about the atmosphere, view and cocktail options. We are already planning a trip back within the next few months and will absolutely be booking our rooms at The Godfrey. Thank you for your phenomenal service this weekend!
