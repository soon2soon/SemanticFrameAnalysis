For a chain hotel, this is the best.  Gorgeous interior, spacious rooms, soft/comfy bedding, and friendly customer service.  The room itself was the largest I've ever stayed in...possibly fits 3 regular-sized rooms in this one.  It had a floor-to-ceiling window that stretched to both walls so that I could have a complete view if the city.  Just mesmerizing.  I had a mini-fridge, 2 small bottled waters, bath and body works toiletries, and great coffee with a keurig.   The best part of my stay was one of doormen, a nice, young man, that gave me and a co-worker a coupon for a free appetizer at an upscale bar around the corner.  He was very helpful as we wanted something not crowded but where we could watch the NFL draft.  And, it met our expectations. Free wi-fi in your room and the restaurant, too!
