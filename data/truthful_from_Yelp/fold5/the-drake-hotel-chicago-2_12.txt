The Drake is beautifully set along the Chicago coast and a marvel to the area. While the elevators are slow, you can only hope to die in a fire at such a nice establishment. The service was spectacular, the wait staff genuinely friendly and the decorum amazing. I've been to many fine places and The Drake will be fondly remembered as one of them. Thank you again to everyone who helped make this such a great trip.
