Was with a group staying there.  We were all upgraded to a one-bedroom suite that included a seep rate living room with wet bar, sitting area, fireplace, and powder room.  Great staff that was always professional and courteous.   Great amenities including nice sitting area off lobby, comfortable bar with knowledgable bartenders, and solid restaurant.  The location is perfect as the nightlife of rush street is right outside the door.
