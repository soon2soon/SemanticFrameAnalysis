The moment I walked to the hotel I was greeted by the doorman who helped me with my bags. There were always at least two doormen at the front door to greet the guest. The people at the front desk were also very kind and knowledgeable about the area. I arrived at the hotel at around 12:30pm and was able to quickly check in and get to my room, which is great since most hotels I have been to do not let you check in untill 2 or 3 pm. The doorman also helped us with our luggage from our car to our hotel room when we checked in and from the room to our car when we checked out. The room itself was also extremely clean, not a spec of dust anywhere. Everything in the room was spotless and really clean. The bathroom was nice and very clean. The towels, bed sheets and pillow cases looked like they haven't been used at all. The lobby looked great and was confortable. There was free coffee at the lobby which was also pretty nice. The only thing that they could imporve on is making the mini refrigerators in the rooms a little colder. I put a few water bottles in there over night and the next day they weren't even cold at all, even the drinks in the fridge weren't really cold. I stayed here for four nights and it was an overall great experience. I would love to stay here again.
