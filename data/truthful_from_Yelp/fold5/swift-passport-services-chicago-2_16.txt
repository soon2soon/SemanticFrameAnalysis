Super nice, quick, helpful. Cute office. Street parking is good. They answer their phone or call you back. I can't say the employees kept me totally confident in them (sounded like small-town bubs on the phone), but when I pushed them for details they reassured me there are never problems (with business visas to China; with FedEx delivery w/i Chicago) They sent me FedEx tracking #, e-rcpt ,etc. I appreciate the techsavvyness. If you pay by cc they add $5.
