Beautiful hotel and the staff catered to my every request. The front desk charged my phone nightly (forgot my charger). They gave me tons of L'occitane minis when I asked for extra. The bellhop knew his stuff, got me cabs within seconds, got me everywhere I needed to go and he was a phenomenal whistler. The amenities were awesome. Beautiful ladies locker room, lap pool, jaccuzi, dry sauna, wet sauna, gym, snacks. My regret is that I didn't take advantage of the $50 off spa happy hour. The complimentary morning coffee was levazza and came in light, medium, and dark roast and the rishi teas were legit. If you have the budget to stay here, do it!
