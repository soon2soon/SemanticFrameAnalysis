One of the best hotel i ever stayed. As soon as we arrived, doorman already moved our luggage and open the door before we even realized that we had arrived. The room comes with so many little details that makes me love this hotel. For examples: electric kettle, complimentary starbucks instant coffee, gourmet teas, a large bottle water, ice bin, free wifi. And they listened to little things we requested. Very impressed. Those are little things that i love about this hotel. All the staff are great. Very friendly and helpful when you need help. There is even a complimentary car service. We didn't get to try it but which hotel offer those? Overall, when available, this is the only hotel i will stay in the future.
