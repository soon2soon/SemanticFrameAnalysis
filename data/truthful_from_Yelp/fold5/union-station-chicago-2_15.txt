Union Station - gets me to and from the burbs in a flash.  It's historic and large.  You can get various Metra lines and the Amtrak from here.  I've only eaten once at one of the restaurants... meh.  Gotta love the convenience though of it all.  The lower level is fairly easy to figure out - south concourse versus north.  Sometimes it smells like the train fuel as trains are constantly coming and going.  Trains run pretty regularly.  I can't complain, as I live right on the train line.
