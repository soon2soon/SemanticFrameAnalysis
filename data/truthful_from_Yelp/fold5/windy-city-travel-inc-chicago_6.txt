These guys, especially Kathy Allinson, are the best travel agents I have ever worked with.  Kathy got us a special deal to go to Italy and tour Rome, Florence, rest of Tuscany and Venice.  Everything went without a hitch and Kathy was always available by email to give us advice on various issues.  Just to put it in perspective; another agency had attempted to do the same for us a few years back for Spain and things were problematic from the start. I recommend Windy City Travel, especially Kathy, very highly.
