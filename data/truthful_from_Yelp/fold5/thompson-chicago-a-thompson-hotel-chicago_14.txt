This place was fantastic.  I wish I brought my camera to take pictures of the lobby. It really was a delightful place to stay. The staff was super-attentive and everything was perfect for our one night stay. I'm glad I decided to take a chance on this place and I'm glad that it wasn't booked up. The views were spectacular and the beds were super comfortable.  They even had an outlet with USB cable inputs which were perfect for us since we had a bunch of devices to charge up. The best part about the room was the bathroom.  The tub was nice and deep and big enough for two. I couldn't figure out how to use the shower, I couldn't ever get the hot water working in the shower, so I took a bath. The knobs were way confusing. The TV was nice and large. I really wanted to try the restaurant downstairs, but my kids wanted to go to the incredible pancake house across the street, which will be my next review...
