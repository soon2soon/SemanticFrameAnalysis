We are LA residents, visiting town for a couple days.  Booked a suite...kinda expensive, but what the heck!  My kids' first reaction to the suite was:  "it's just like the HANGOVER!".  We loved the hotel!  All the staff were professional, piolite & 1st rate.  Our only beef...the surprise of $52 a night parking!  Yikes!
