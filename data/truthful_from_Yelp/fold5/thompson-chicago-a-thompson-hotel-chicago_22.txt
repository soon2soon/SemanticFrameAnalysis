I was able to preview this hotel during it's soft opening a few months ago, and was blown away.  Right in the heart of the Gold Coast neighborhood, this place is the perfect retreat for an out-of-town visitor or a Chicago local looking for a staycation.   The lobby, even though still under construction was welcoming and warm, as was the staff.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the bathroom was divine.  I huge shower and lots of amenities provided. If you can afford to stay in one of the penthouse lofts, definitely do! The views are phenomenal and the loft set-up is unique and gives the whole space a homey feel.
