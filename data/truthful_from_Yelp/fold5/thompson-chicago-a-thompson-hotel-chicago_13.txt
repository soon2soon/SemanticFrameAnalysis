I got my parents a room here and it was perfect in every way. The location is great you can walk to restaurants,shopping and the lake front. The hotel is beautiful and having stayed there before the remodel I will say that they did an excellent job with the rooms. Check in was easy and front desk was very friendly. The concierge helped me to send my parents a sweet treat of cookies and milk when they returned to the hotel at the end of the night. The restaurant in the hotel nico Â osteria is very good.
