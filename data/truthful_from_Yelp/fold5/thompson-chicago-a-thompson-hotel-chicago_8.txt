My friend was invited here to review the hotel and I was her guest.  The lobby is impeccably designed, along with the rooms.  I could explore the bookshelves for hours and cozy up in one of their seating areas.  The penthouse is very chic and would be wonderful for entertaining, with a view that can't be beat.  The hotel provided comfy robes and even delivered milk and cookies before bedtime.  The beds were extremely comfortable and I got a godd night's sleep.  Such great customer service from the doorman, hostess, concierge, and room staff.  In the morning, they provided Intelligista coffee to go, along with several treats, which were well appreciated. We went to Lux Bar for dinner, right across the street.  The area it is located in could not be cuter!  With several delicious, well known restaurants to chose from and a small park for the warmer months.  Not to mention, the exquisite shopping right around the corner on Michigan Avenue! If you're looking for a modern, upscale hotel in Chicago, this is a great choice!  It's not stuck in the loop, but it's close enough to everything. Thank you for a wonderful night's sleep! Oh, just a quick tip: perhaps provide electronic accommodations for guests.  The room is equipped for the iPhone 5, which was great for me, but having some other electronic chargers (for my friend) would have been a nice touch!  Not a deal breaker by any means, though.
