Forget any travel website and call Martha. I am old school and like to talk to a real person. Not only is Martha helpful and knowledgeable, she gave me a better price and deal than any other agency or website. It was a pleasure to deal with Martha at Sunset Travel. I will for sure have her take care of my travel needs in the future as well a refer her to anyone I can. Thanks Martha and Jay too. You all are the best!!
