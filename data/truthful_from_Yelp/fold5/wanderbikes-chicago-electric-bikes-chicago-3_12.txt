WanderBikes is a great way to see the city.   We rented the bikes for 4 hours and road up and down the lakeshore and used the bike lanes available on many of the streets in Chicago to enjoy the riverfront.    The two guys who run and own WanderBikes could not have been nicer.   My only concern about leaving this review is others are going to read it and start making it hard to get a reservation because when the secret gets out, it will be hard to get a rental.  This is a hidden gem.
