I booked theWit for a meeting and had a fabulous experience. Location: Perfect location. Close to all that Chicago has to offer. Service: The hotel staff is very attentive and proactive with guest needs. I interacted with staff from the front desk, concierge, banquets, room service, State & Lake restaurant, etc. and found all of them to be extremely accommodating. Made my experience one to remember. Guest room: Loved my hotel room. The room was very nicely appointed and very comfy. Wifi worked well. Beautiful view from my room on the 20th floor. I love the little touches - the crickets and birds sounds in the guest room hallways, etc. I am booking the hotel for another meeting in Oct! Can't wait to come back!
