I love the Commons Club here (bar on the second floor): it is such a chic and intimate environment. The service is wonderful- the employees are phenomenal and have such wonderful personalities. I adore the games and the cool books - there is a wide range of entertainment ranging from uno, connect four, cards against humanity to dirty adult games. Tons of fun and great drinks! This is the perfect place for a date or to kick it back with your girlfriends. You will not be disappointed.
