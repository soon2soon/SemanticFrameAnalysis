My cousin lives in the residencies here, and I've been working as his personal assistant for the past 3 weeks, so I've dealt with just about everyone here.  I absolutely love the staff!  They are beyond polite, have amazing memories, and are so helpful!  From the bellmen meeting us at the car to transport our call full of purchases, to another bellman helping me find a box to get stuff out of the storage unit.  They help with EVERYTHING!  I was even leaving one day and it was raining, and someone from the hotel side gave me an [amazing] umbrella!  Seriously, I wish I had enough money to live here myself....
