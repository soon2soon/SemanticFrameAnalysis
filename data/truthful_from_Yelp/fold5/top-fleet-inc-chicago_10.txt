Used this rental company recently for a bachelor party.  The driver was on time, very respectful to all of us as we were to him.  We were able to bring our own booze on board, and our own music.  We were pretty blitzed by the end of the night, and the driver even waited while we looked for our lost friend.  Would recommend this limo service to anyone in the Chicago area.
