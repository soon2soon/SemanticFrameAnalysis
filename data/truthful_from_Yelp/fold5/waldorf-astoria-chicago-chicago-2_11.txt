Wow! We had an amazing room and we were upgraded to a suite for free! We stayed on the 26th floor and the room was about 900-1000 sq ft. Everything was clean and cozy. The bathroom was beautiful and all the products were high quality. My BF ordered champagne and a dozen roses. They were absolutely beautiful (I posted a picture of them). The chocolate covered strawberries were also worth getting. The gym and spa facilities were great! It was all included in the price too. We ate at the restaurant on the second floor and everything we ordered was great. Make sure you ask for military discount. It was almost half the price.
