My wife and I used Janet Rhines at Windy City Travel to plan our entire 2 week honeymoon.  We met with Janet a couple times to talk about each city in Italy, it's pro's and con's and how long would be best to stay in each place.  She was very educated on each place and knew of several great restaurants and places for us to visit.  Communication between her and us was easy and we were able to always get in touch with her within 12 hours of the hundreds (well, several) questions that I had. Obviously, you can plan a trip on you're own but using a travel company like Windy City is well worth it as a 2 week trip has a lot of fine detail that many people skip over, especially when you have a strict budget like many newlyweds do.  One important thing to note (and I am commenting on a review by Joe K below) is that the travel agent has nothing to do with airline ticket misspellings - those are things that you need to confirm with the airline before you get on a plane.  We had no issues with airline stuff because even though we used Windy City Travel, we called ahead to the airline to confirm our flights, meals, and names on the tickets. Janet listen to our concerns about budget and gave us the best advice.  We went to Venice, Florence, Tuscany with trips to Radda, Cortona, and Orvietto, and then traveled to Rome and Positano with a day trip to Capri, and then Naples.  In 2 weeks and lots of traveling, you can get stressed out.  Thankfully, Windy City Travel booked us reliable drivers, great hotels with amazing views, and wonderful tours, all at comfortable prices. I highly suggest using Janet and or Windy City Travel for any of your long or international travel needs - the trip was flawless.  As for people like Joe K., he doesn't have a valid argument and you shouldn't base your thoughts on that review.
