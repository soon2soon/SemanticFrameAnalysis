I'm super mad at myself because it's been a year since my boyfriend and I sailed on the Windy, and I never reviewed it. How in the world that happened, I have no idea. So let me go ahead and start my review by saying: this tour is a blast and I would do it again in a heartbeat. Luckily, Groupon is always my way to experience new tours and fun times because it makes everything more affordable. Unfortunately, I decided to book our tour on a super cold day, so that made everything a tad less enjoyable because it was even colder on the lake. The tour itself was super fun and interesting. The tour guide we had was hilarious and super knowledgeable. I was impressed with how much she knew about the city and the history. What was a really cool aspect, is the tour was only a portion of the sail itself. They let the passengers explore the ship and take pictures for the first 20 minutes of the tour. Some aspects that really made me impressed with the hospitality of the ship was the bartender and the fact the ship was loaded with lots of blankets for the passengers. The bartender was super nice and chatty as we enjoyed some time to warm up from the cold outside. This ship is available to rent for private parties, weddings, receptions, etc. If I had a load of money, I would definitely rent this baby out and have a blast. The crew is hilarious, the ship is gorgeous, and what better than to sail on Lake Michigan and have a party?
