Trump who? Wyndham is where it's at. Overlooking the river, being in one of the best going-out locations in all of Chicago, and having wonderfully accommodating staff is what makes me never want to stay anywhere else in my Chicago travels. The first night in town, my roommates and I were sadly given news that water was out in half the establishment, forcing us to be temporally relocated to the O'Hare Hilton in neighboring Rosemont. After an 8 hour drive from Minneapolis, this was not ideal, but after seeing the family in front of us yell at the front desk for 15 minutes, I happily accepted the bed they offered to us. Here's the great thing about unexpected bumps in the road like this: it was completely comped, courtesy of the Wyndham. You win some, you lose some, and we most definitely won within our loss of a room. Now on to the best part: when we checked in the next day, the front desk notified us that we had been upgraded to a corner room on the 25th floor. The view made me never want to leave the window, and room service delivered a complimentary bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to our room literally 5 minutes after settling in. That's exactly how I like my wine - delivered quickly. As my roommates and I were in town for the Miley Cyrus concert, we went downstairs and asked the concierge where to go if you're looking to stay out all night (and then some). Not only did he have a handful of places to check out, he gave us a heads up about specific rules and expectations of clubs in the area, as well as suggestions of when to hit up which bar/club. Pro tip: Don't yell at your hotel staff for things they can't control. Hospitality is a thankless industry, but if you're understanding and nice, they'll do everything in their power to make sure your vacation is better than you'd even imagine.
