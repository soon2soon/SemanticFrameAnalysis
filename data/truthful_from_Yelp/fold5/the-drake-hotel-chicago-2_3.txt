March 13, 2015 I enjoy this place quite thoroughly especially for this major event, Ladybug Bash!  The place always definitely display elegant aesthetics.  Great lounge offers were available. Firstly, the historical feature really takes me home.  A lot of meaningful historical culture has been lost in today society.  This place offer a sense of old money meeting new money.  This place surely is a timeless historical piece.  Indeed, a wonderful nostalgic feeling reminds me of the 1997 Titanic film. In terms of hosting major events, the Ladybug Bash is much of a success!  The Drake definitely provided much of the service, cooperation, and atmosphere to make this happen.  Coordination is key and I believe they have done extremely well!  Like not everything is perfect, the staff and team members did their best to follow up on minor problems. Therefore, after party are offer in various ways.  The Shay was offer as sponsorship!  Love it!  The dining lounge The Drake have jazz/blues live music available as well!  It's definitely quite enjoyable! Lastly, the Ladybug Bash is a major success due to charitable communities and supports.  As a guest, I am astounded by the quality!  Truly, this place is a blessing of the Magnificent Mile!
