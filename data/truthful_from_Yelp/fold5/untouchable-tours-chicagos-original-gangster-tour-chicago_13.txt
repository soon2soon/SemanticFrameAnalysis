Absolutely THE BEST TOUR I've taken in the past 100 years - and I've taken tours from Prague (ghost tour at midnite- very very good) to NYC to Kyoto, Japan.  But this is THE BEST - animated, hilarious, - you are visiting the actual sites and feel you are back in the 1920's with this excellent actor gangster "Rocky" and his sidekick the bus driver "Nails" --- I could write for an hour but not convey properly how enjoyable and funny it is to do this excellent tour!  You can do it twice, three times there is so much you will realize you missed!!  It's a great 2 hours --- DO IT!
