This was my second stay. Convenient, comfy, and clean! I got a good deal because I paid in full two weeks in advance, and they graciously gave me a late checkout AND someone carried my bag up the steps to the L stop that is close to the hotel. I got to the airport via the orange line in under 30 minutes. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Chicago for work or pleasure.
