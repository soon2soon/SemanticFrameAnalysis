A + + location! I loved that the Red Line Addison Stop was a two minute walk to the hostel. And the Addison Stop is a 15 minute train ride from Downtown Chicago, and when you transfer to the Blue line at Jackson, that train takes you to O'hare Airport in less than 45 minutes. The bars and lively nightlife in Wrigleyville are conveniently located right on Clark street behind the hostel. I stayed at a couple other hostels in Chicago (not naming names...) but I honestly don't think they hold a candle to this place's prime location, super friendly and helpful staff and clean and fresh facilities. FYI, the bed price included free breakfast (loved the healthy variety of apples, oranges, and bananas, yummy wheat toast and peanut butter and pancakes :) ) and also free wifi. And in my room the all female dorm, there was my room's own private bathroom with shower. Bonus points. Stay here! :)
