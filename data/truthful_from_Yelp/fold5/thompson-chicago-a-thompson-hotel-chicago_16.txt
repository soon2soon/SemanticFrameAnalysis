Amazing customer service.  After using the Spothero app to find the cheapest parking around, we had a bachelorette weekend touring Chicago locale but stayed here at the Thompson Hotel.  I loved the location/view of our suite, but more importantly - the customer service was top notch.  They had a complimentary car service for our bachelorette, and provided so many little touches.  I couldn't help but notice that they even had a Thompson Hotel umbrella in the closet for those rainy days, as well.  The bathroom was spacious and full of mirrors (much appreciated when you have multiple girls primping). The lobby restaurant bar is a fun place to sit and people watch.  Overall, a modern vibe but fun and comfortable, as well.  I look forward to returning again or having visitors stay here next time!
