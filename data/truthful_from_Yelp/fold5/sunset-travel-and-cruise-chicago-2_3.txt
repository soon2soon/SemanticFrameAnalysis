Just got back from a marvelous vacation to London, Lyon and Paris, all put together by Ryan at Sunset Travel. He worked with me to find the right hotels and put together all the train travel, which went off without a hitch - the vendor he used, Avanti, was very reliable and professional - the only glitch was booking us on the milk run from Paris to Lyon (5 hours!), instead of the bullet train (2 hrs), but when we noticed that, Ryan had them correct it immediately. Ryan gave us a nice Power Point binder that came in handy as we traveled, as it had all the information right at hand, and several nice freebies, like little maps, a pair of three day Metro ticket for Paris, and other stuff. He was always helpful and responsive, and very easy to work with. I'd certainly use his services again.
