This place was fantastic as a no-frills crash pad. My expectations were exceeded. Not only was it super clean and safe, but it also had a warm and friendly atmosphere. If you love walking around and exploring, the neighborhood is a good starting place. There are some great restaurants and shopping within short walking distance. The train is also very close so you can go downtown quickly as well. Perks: Free internet that actually works well (unlike many places I've stayed) Free coffee and breakfast The bathrooms were so clean I hardly noticed I was sharing Access to a refrigerator, laundry, TV... There's a neat little market right next door Quirks: If you are on the top floor it is indeed quite a tiring trek up all those stairs! (no elevator) If you are a smoker you will not only have to go outside (normal) but also go to the alleyway on the side of the building. Smokers were huddled there in the cold and rain :/
