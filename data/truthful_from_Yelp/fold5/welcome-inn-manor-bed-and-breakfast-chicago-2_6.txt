My wife and I spent a long weekend here recently and thought this was one of the best city locations we've ever stayed- even comparing with five star hotels. We had a chance to be close to the ground in South Side (Bronzeville) Chicago - half way between the University of Chicago (we were visiting a nephew) and downtown (which is amazing) -- and feel ourselves surrounded by local culture. Mell and Angie, the owners, were welcoming and great hosts. The house is a newly removed old mansion. Our suite - the Nate King Cole room - was extremely large, clean, and tastefully designed with outstanding Afro-American art. The furniture and such amenities as a sauna were fantastic. We asked to see some other rooms for fun: the Rosenwald and Alinsky rooms were equally artistic in design. The owners made us feel at home and made themselves available for any questions about getting around Chicago and the local culture. Breakfast was a feast, mouth-watering and delicious. We didn't need anything until dinnertime. Our needs as vegetarians were catered to gracefully and perfectly. One morning a guest jazz musician from Kansas sang Stormy Monday and Autumn Leaves during breakfast. I felt lucky to be down-home in Chicago. Guests come from all over. Discussions were wonderful at the table. One of the great things about this BnB is that it is located in a gentrifying black neighborhood. We felt the culture's inner strength and emergence. Public transportation was fine. Cabs at night weren't expensive. On Sunday morning I realized that I could hear a gospel service and walked a few blocks and had a wonderful time. This BnB was an important reason that I enjoyed our visit to Chicago. This place is an oasis and special treat.
