I used Travisa for a student visa to Spain. It was totally worth the money, I was able to mail them my documents to submit on my behalf, meaning I only had to make one trip to Chicago when my visa was ready to pick up. (I was living in Cleveland). Also, despite my meticulous preparation of the paperwork, the Spanish consulate apparently managed to lose track of one document from my application. I emailed another copy to Travisa and they appended it to my application (saving me yet another trip to Chicago.) My visa was processed in two weeks, while others I know applying at the same time without an agency had to wait a month or more.
