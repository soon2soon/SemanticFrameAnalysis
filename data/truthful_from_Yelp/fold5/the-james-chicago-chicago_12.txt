Found this great deal on Hotwire for New Year's Eve.. Most rooms in town were 250+ and thankfully to Hotwire we were able to get a much lower rate. The pictures online don't do this place justice.. It does not have the most amazing decor but it has personality if that makes sense. If you want super trendy or modern, or super fancy do not come here. It's very comfy. The beds and towels are amazing... and the robes!! Oh how I love their robes!! The service is great everyone we have come in contact with has treated us very well despite a very busy evening... The front desk was helpful. Would def stay here again!
