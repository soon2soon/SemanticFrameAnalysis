My dad and I were visiting Chicago for the first time, and this cruise came highly recommended by the concierge, as well as local friends. We had a great time, a very knowledgable tour guide, and a relaxing, informative time. The price is more than fair for the length and detail of the trip. You have great perspective on these incredibly impressive structures, which make for excellent photo ops, as well as learning interesting facts about the architects who built them, the styles, and the reasoning behind the way the buildings are. If you're visiting the city like we were, it's a must-see, in my opinion.
