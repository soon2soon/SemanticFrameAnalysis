Although the hotel is still titled Hotel 71 on the outside, it was recently renamed as the Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront. This place is right on the riverfront and blocks away from shopping on the Magnificent Mile and State street shops. It is literally a block away from the river where you can stand on one of the bridges and admire the beautiful Chicago skyline. Everything about this hotel was fabulous. Although a little bit more pricey at around $200 per night, I felt it was worth it. The amenities were top notch. Serve was excellent. I loved everything from the sleek decor to the Keurig machine and mini fridge in the room. After staying at the Congress Plaza for a few nights, coming to the Wyndham was like arriving in heaven. I would definitely stay here again!
