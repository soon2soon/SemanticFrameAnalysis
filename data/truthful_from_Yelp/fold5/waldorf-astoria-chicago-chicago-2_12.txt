One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Impeccably clean everywhere! I was amazed that this hotel was not brand new. I was upgraded to the Astoria Suite and loved it. The fireplace adds a homely feel. The bathroom was a highlight as it was huge, the floors were clean enough to eat off of and the shower was so amazing I didn't want to get out! The service is top notch. Three examples, I was walked to the elevator by James the receptionist who explained where the pool and spa were, to make a right out of the elevator.. what to dial to reach him. I was running out to grab some food at night when the doorman gave me an umbrella letting me know its raining, and third was the event staff. I was there for a work event, and there were meals served and the waitstaff were so observant that when getting the eggs I mentioned hot sauce to a coworker, and one of the staff brought over a little Tabasco bottle to my seat. Oh and their coffee is amazing!
