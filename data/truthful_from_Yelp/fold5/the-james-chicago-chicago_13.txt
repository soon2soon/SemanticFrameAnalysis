This was the best hotel that I have stayed in.  The rooms were great it didn't smell like most hotels.  It felt like home.  We were on the 13 floor so we were able to see downtown and all the beautiful buildings.   The valet however put a dent on our Cadillac SUV rental.  The first time we had them Valet.  However they were nice and gave us an upgrade on our room and valet was free the whole weekend.   The staff here are friendly and always happy.  Anything that we needed they would make sure we got it.   The stay was so comfy I really did not want to leave.
