My husband and I worked with Kathy to put together a 10-day trip to France as a "second honeymoon."  From the moment I initially contacted her to the minute I stepped off the plane back home in Chicago, things went smoother than I could have ever dreamed!  We had told Kathy how long we were planning on traveling, what our budget was, and the kinds of things we wanted to see, and she was able to craft an itinerary perfectly suited to our needs. We never had to worry about a thing; from the initial planning stages, to the finalization of arrangements, to actually being in France and going on the tours that we had talked about for so long--everything went off without a hitch!  We were really able to relax and enjoy ourselves knowing that all the arrangements had been made far in advance and we had nothing to worry about except having a good time.  With Kathy's help, we were able to see and do things (such as a tour of the castles of the Loire Valley and an amazing private tour with a driver through Provence) that we never would have even thought of had we planned the trip ourselves.  The hotels she found for us were amazing, and definitely not ones we would have found on our own.  We will not hesitate to call on Kathy again for our next trip!
