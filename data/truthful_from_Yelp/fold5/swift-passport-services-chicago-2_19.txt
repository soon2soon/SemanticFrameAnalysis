I'm going to Brazil in a week. Just under a week ago, I had a passport that didn't have a Brazilian visa in it. I googled around for my options and didn't find a cheaper or clearer option than SPS, so I gave them a call. Laurie was super helpful - I explained my situation (I'm disorganized and a poor grad student) and we worked through how I'd have to ship and what expedited service would work best. She put in a conditional order depending on how the shipping worked out, and it turned out that the 7 business day service would meet my timeline needs and give me a day to spare. I've got a Brazilian visa in my passport, and I have a week of not needing to worry about it, a week I don't deserve.
