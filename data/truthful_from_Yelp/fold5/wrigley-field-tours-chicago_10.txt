If your a Cubs fan or not, I would highly recommend this tour of this historic baseball field! For the price of $25, a tour that lasted about 90 minutes.  The tour consisted of the press box, the dug out, walking along the field, the bleacher section and other sections. The guides were very helpful regarding taking pictures and the history of  the ball field. Please beware... a lot of walking and at time steep incline ramps or narrow steps.  Overall - GREAT TOUR FOR ALL
