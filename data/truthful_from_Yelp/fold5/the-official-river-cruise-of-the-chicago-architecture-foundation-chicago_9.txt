Took my parents on the cruise led by Chicago Architecture Foundation. Our guide was knowledgeable, calm, and charming. I saw so many buildings I had never noticed before ! During the trip my parents expressed more than once they were impressed with the tour and Chicago as a city. Highly recommended. The drinks at the bar aren't so great.
