An absolutely amazing time! Had a groupon for a two person gangsters and ghouls tour. Tour guide and helpers were excellent and helpful and knowledgable. The main tour guide Joel walked many people who had never kayaked the basics of it. There were multiple stops on the tour and it took about three hours total time as we had a big group of about 20 kayaks. Slowest part was the start as we had to get everyone in the water. I would recommend anyone to do this. The weather was perfect and seeing the riverside architecture and homes were also amazing.
