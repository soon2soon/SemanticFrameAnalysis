One of the best hotels I've stayed at. Service is impeccable. Rooms are modern, clean and sleek in design. I didn't have the best view, but for the great deal I got on the room, that was the least of my worries. Smaller, boutique hotel so service is much more personable. Definitely try out the steak place below...dry aged burger was to die for...as was the jalape√±o mac n cheese. You can't beat the location, with a trader joe's right in front, a block away from Magnificent Mile, an Eataly and TONS of great James Beard winning restaurants. I'll definitely be back to stay here!!!
