The Langham is probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. We spent a couple of nights there during the weekend of our wedding and I believe it was the right choice to splurge on that level of luxury. The suite was huge and beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I'm not usually a fan of modernist furniture style, but the room decor was clean without being cold. The view of the river and downtown was picture perfect. My wife and in-laws and I might have snapped a hundred pictures from those windows. The staff treated us very well, and while they might have been a little more attentive than we are used to, everything was done to perfection. The bed and amenities were very welcome at the end of a long, crazy wedding day. Room service breakfast was delicious. If you'd like to experience how the 1% live, the Langham can probably give you a pretty good simulation of that. (The actual 1% probably own something over across the street in the Trump building.)
