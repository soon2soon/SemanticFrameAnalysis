Great Service! I have been working with Marcie to plan our upcoming honeymoon to Maui. She has always been very quick to respond to my many emails and phone calls. We were originally looking at various locations such as Cabo and other hawaiian islands and she was able to put together pricing for many differnt options for us. After all of that hard work we decided to go with Maui, which she knew a lot about which was very helpful. We recently had a major schedule change in our airline tickets, but she was able to work with the airlines and get us on an even better flight for no extra money! She stood up to the airlines and looked out for our best interest and I really appreciated that :) Now we are all set to have a wonderful honeymoon in Maui! Thanks Marcie!!
