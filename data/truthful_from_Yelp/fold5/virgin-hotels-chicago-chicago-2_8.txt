We absolutely loved our stay at Virgin Hotels Chicago! The chambers were amazing- very comfortable. It felt like a home away from home. We talked about how the chamber would make an awesome apartment that anyone would love to live in. The food in the Commons Club was very delicious. The portions were very small, smaller than expected but still very good. We're excited to come back when the rooftop bar and Miss Ricky's are open. The service was unbeatable. Everyone we talked to was very kind, professional and very personable. Our waitress in the Commons club, Mary Kate was great. Our room service attendants were also on top of their game. I want to book another night's stay asap and I would recommend to anyone interested in having an overnight downtown Chicago.
