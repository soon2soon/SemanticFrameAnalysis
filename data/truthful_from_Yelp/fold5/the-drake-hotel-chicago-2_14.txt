Oh, the Drake.  She's so beautiful!  We had a meeting in the executive boardroom on the 10th floor.  It was a gorgeous, quiet room with it's own bathroom.  It also has floor to ceiling windows overlooking Lake Michigan.  Man, it's a great room!  Service was impeccable.  Christopher took our picture, carried our bags, etc... and then refused our attempt tip him.  It was a great experience.
