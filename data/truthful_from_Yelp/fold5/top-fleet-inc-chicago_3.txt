I used Top Fleet Limo for my fiance's birthday celebration and was incredibly impressed. I filled out an online quote request and in less than 10 minutes I received a personalized email from Ryan with a very reasonable quote. I had some questions prior to booking and Ryan responded to each question incredibly fast. Upon booking, I received a confirmation email with all the details and pricing of my reservation. On the day of, I got a call a half an hour before my pick up time from the driver, who introduced himself and explained where he would be parked and that we could come down early if we wanted to. When we came down, the driver (Bruce) was incredibly friendly, taking pics of our whole group in front of the limo, showing me how to plug in my phone for music, and encouraging us to use the champagne flutes on board. The limo (an SUV limo designed to fit 14) Â itself was really nice, clean and new looking. Bruce returned on time to pick us up from the restaurant at the end of the night. Highly recommended overall for your limo needs.
