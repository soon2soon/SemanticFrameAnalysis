Looking for a fun way to explore Chicago, and experience some of its unique cuisines and history? Try Tastebud Tours.  On our tour, I sampled Oprah's favorite pizza while sitting at Vince Vaughn's favorite table. I saw remnants of the great fire and learned how Mrs. O'Leary's cow had gotten a bum wrap. I met one of the Chicago's hottest new chefs and tasted one of his unique dessert creations.  What I didn't get to do was use one of America's top ranked restrooms; that treat was reserved for only the female members of our tour group. All the restaurants on the tour are unique to Chicago.  Some boast a wealth of history while others are the latest trend in the Chicago culinary scene.  We tasted a variety of quite diverse foods.  You will definitely get enough to eat.  In hindsight I wish I had passed on the second helping of pizza and the burger. Rain or shine, the tour goes on.  Ominous skies at the beginning of our tour had me worried.  However, even when Chicago started demonstrating why it's called the Windy City, with umbrellas flying and rain slanting down at angles, the tour didn't stop.  Our guide Lynn picked out some strategic locations to shelter us from the weather while he regaled us with interesting facts about Chicago.  Throughout the tour he also shared some useful money saving tips such as where to get a cheap boat ride on the Chicago River and where to find inexpensive but quality coffee.  Out-of-towners, you might want to consider taking this tour at the beginning of your visit so that you can fully utilize some of Lynn's tips. I was the lucky recipient of a complimentary tour through Yelp but I believe it is well worth $44.  Check their website for special offers.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Tastebud Tours to all visitors and Chicago residents.
