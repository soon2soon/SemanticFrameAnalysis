When I realized my passport was expiring the day before my trip to Sweden, and there was only one business day before take-off, I totally panicked. After putting myself on the waitlist for an appointment with will call at the Chicago Passport Agency in the Loop, I found Swift via Yelp and they assured me that they could ensure that I received my renewal in less than 24 hours. Swift is one of the couriers that works with the State Dept for expedited renewals (which I learned after asking if they just made will call appointments). I dropped off all of my stuff in person (their website is super helpful re: forms and payment, so check it out) and was impressed by how easy and nice they were. In the end, I got a 7:30AM call from the passport agency with a same day appointment. I called Swift on the off chance that I could do a last minute cancellation and partial refund, and was shocked when they said sure. I picked up my papers and, as a grad student, was beyond thrilled to hand over my credit card for a refund. Now that I've learned my lesson, I hopefully won't use them again, but would send anyone Swift's way.
