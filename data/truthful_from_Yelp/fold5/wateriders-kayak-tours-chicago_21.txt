Over the years I've read so many stories about things in the river. Dead bodies, the Eastland, huge levels of bacteria and most recently, an extremely cute alligator. But myself in the river? No! Never ever...until now. Wateriders Kayak Tours is an excellent place and a really fun way to spend a few hours. It's really affordable and the people that work there are really laid back. They really let you just go out and do what you want to do and have fun. Going under the massive bridges in a kayak was pretty amazing. What a view! It also made me really aware of how far our city needs to go to really clean up the river. It is very, very dirty and until you are right there in it you may think it's not as bad as it is. I think we counted over 10 floating condoms on our journey. As you come closer to the bridges going towards the lake the water is not as filth ridden. If you are not used to kayaking that is also when you realize that it is hard work using that much arm power. I would go to Wateriders and rent some kayaks again in an instant. It was totally fun and it's awesome that there are places like this in the city. Just remember not to fall in and if you do... don't swallow!!! Whatever you do... do not swallow!
