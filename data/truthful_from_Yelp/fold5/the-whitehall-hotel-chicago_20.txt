We booked a romance package at the Whitehall for our wedding night.  We aren't going on a honeymoon right away so we wanted the wedding night to be extra special.  When we checked in the front desk was very friendly and helpful.  When we got upstairs to our room, we found they had upgraded us to a suite, which was a wonderful surprise.  The bedroom area was small but beautiful, with dark wood furniture and wonderful linens. Our package included parking, a dozen roses, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries, which were waiting for us in the bar off the living room area. The bed itself - I want this bed. I'd take it with me if I could!  I had requested all feather items be removed from our room due to my allergies and that usually means less cushy pillows and covers, but even the feather free pillows and linens are divine.  We slept so well and so comfortably, the best I've ever had in a hotel.  We had a view of the Hancock and the lake from the bedroom and balcony off it as well, which added to the magic of our day.  In the morning, we had our breakfasts delivered by room service, also included in our package, and it was set up in the dining area of our suite.  It was a lovely way to start our day, so relaxed with just the two of us. The breakfasts were huge, more than we could possibly eat and much more than I expected.  I fully plan on returning yearly for our anniversary.  I've been to many hotels downtown but this was by far the best.
