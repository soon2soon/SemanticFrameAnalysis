This was such a great experience. 5/5 definitely. Me and my wife got an option for Lakefront Tour from Groupon. I liked that it was easy to book online using Groupon code, so no need to call. Once we arrived, we were greeted by Brady who was our tour guide. He was extremely polite and helpful. Explained us all we needed to know about the bikes and made sure we're comfortable operating them before we started the tour. As for the tour itself, nice thought-out route, very interesting and educating. It hits a great balance of riding a bike and listening to some facts during our stops. We have moved to Chicago like 5 months ago (and been here many times before), so have seen a lot. But he showed a lot of interesting things we have not seen before. Tip: The tour lasts for about 2 - 2.5 hours. So if it's sunny, get some sunscreen! As for the bikes themselves, they are really fun and the electric assist makes it much easier to pedal. The amount of assist if adjustable via settings that Brady explained. Actually, there is even an option to set it in recoup mode where it's charging the battery and it's harder to pedal. So if you're in for a workout - you have that option. Overall, extremely satisfied with my experience, thinking about renting the bike for couple hours and just roaming on my own. ;) Thanks!
