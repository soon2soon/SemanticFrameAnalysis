Would stay here again in a HEARTBEAT. Loved, loved, loved it.  Reminded me of the ACE in Palm Springs, except a little more glam. Point being, this is not your parents' hotel. It's got that ACE-y, irreverent, hipster-chic vibe that's very appealing. It's like what the W is going for but doesn't always get to.  The art & design is great, bath products are great, service is very eager and helpful, and Gold Coast location is good. The food in the restaurant is way above par-- I had breakfast & dinner in the dining room, but best of all was ordering spaghetti from room service: honestly, BEST SPAGHETTI OF MY LIFE.  Housemade thick pasta, with an oily, luscious, rich tomato sauce that was the stuff of dreams. Only thing that even came close to it is spaghetti in random rural trattorias in Italy & spaghetti at an amazing restaurant in NYC called L'Impero that is now sadly closed. Breakfast was the only slightly meh experience; everything else was spot on. My husband was coming to Chicago for business the weekend after I was here for a conference, and I made him change his original plan at the Four Seasons and had him stay here. He loved the Thompson too, and ordered the spaghetti twice in a row, once in the dining room as a first course & once for room service.  He was blown away, like I was. Final note: Seems like a great place to throw a party, engagement, etc-- there's a whole floor upstairs that has an elegant bar, a bunch of different chic rooms with lots of windows that connect together through cool passage ways, so you can have all the doors open for a big party, or just have one room for a more intimate one. I would, if I lived in Chicago! Totally looking forward to staying at other Thompsons elsewhere: call me a convert.
