The Wit....Fabulous.... We stayed the weekend Chicago dyes the river Green for St. Patricks Day. Although a drizzle weekend...The Wit and the Windy City did not disappoint. My Husband and I picked the Wit, for its contemporary Style, and its Location to so many things we wanted to see. From the Check-in, to the helpful Concierge, their Spa, the Â outstanding cocktails at the Rooftop Bar..unusual piped in sounds in the hallway, this Hotel sets a new standard for Boutique Hotels. The staff was sincerely helpful without being obsequious. The rooftop bar, was socked in by Fog, but wow, the Fog gave the partially enclosed space a mystical feeling. I could go on...but when you stay at this hotel, be ready for a unique and excellent experience. This will be our Go To Hotel for Chicago.
