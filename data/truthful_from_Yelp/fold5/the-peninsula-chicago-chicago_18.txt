This is one of my favorite hotels to stay.  We routinely go to Chicago for pleasure 2-3 times a year and always stay at this hotel.  In total, we have stayed here at least 8 times and have never been disappointed. The positives: -World-class service (seriously, this place will ruin even other 5-star hotels) -Immaculate, well-designed rooms -Wonderful dining and bar choices (the Lobby for high tea; Shanghai terrace, arguably the best Chinese restaurant in all of Chicago; and the very comfortable bar with the city's top cocktails). -Superb location -Excellent town car service -Reasonable pricing (I feel that the hotel fees for all of the above is definitely well worth it). The negatives; -I still have yet to have even a mildly disappointing experience Conclusion: -The Peninsula is a wonderful hotel without flaws.  I look forward to checking out the other Peninsula on our travels (have plans to visit the one in Beverley Hills).
