Great tour!  When else would you get the opportunity to be on the field of baseballs cathedral.  Our guide had a lot of knowledge of not only the park but the neighborhood. Lots a photos ops from the press box all the way down to the field.  Even if you are not a huge baseball fan the history in that park is fascinating.
