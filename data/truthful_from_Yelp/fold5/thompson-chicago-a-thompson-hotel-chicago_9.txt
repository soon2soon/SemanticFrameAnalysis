Very nice hotel. It is located 2 blocks from the magnificent mile on quaint street with nice eateries very close. The room was clean with modern decor. Bathroom was amazing. We were on a corner of the hotel and the room was on a curve with all windows lining the room. Beautiful view of city in one direction. We walk to the river tour, mellineum park and the art institute with ease. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We had stayed at the four seasons a few days before and this hotel was just as nice with a much more accommodating and friendly staff. This will be our hotel when we come to visit again.
