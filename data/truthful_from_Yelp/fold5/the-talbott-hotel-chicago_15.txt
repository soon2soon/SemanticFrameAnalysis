Found this hotel through Yelp and got a great flight-hotel package on cheaptickets.com that made this already affordable hotel a down-right steal! My boyfriend and I stayed here for our Christmas getaway, and absolutely loved it. The room was spacious and classy, and the staff were courteous and fantastically helpful. We utilized the concierge for most of our dinner plans and their recommendations were spot-on, especially when we asked for a perfect upscale date-night on Christmas Eve. When Second City was completely sold out, the guy on duty at the time recommended a Blues club that was open very late; it was a wonderful way to end our vacation. We did room service for breakfast one morning and the Little Market downstairs was delicious. As for location, you can't get much better than this. We aren't shoppers, but the Talbott is located two blocks from Michigan Avenue. We loved that it was so close to the Chicago-Red station and tons of bus stops, so we were able to get to all the museums we wanted to visit with ease and a quickness. This is also the only hotel I found in the area that offered free internet, which was fast and reliable and made coordinating our daily plans a breeze!
