Loved the tour. You meet outside of McDonalds so you can grab a beverage if you get there early. Stay near the window facing Clark St and you'll see someone appear with a clipboard... that's probably the tour guide. Ours had flaming RED hair... knew it was her without asking. Â The tour lasted about 3 hours. We took the Blood, Guns & Valentines Crime Tour. Our guide was very friendly, informative, entertaining and passionate about her subject. She really made the tour fun. My husband was born & raised in Chicago. He learned some new things too. I loved the John Dillinger lore. I would recommend the tour to anyone interested in Chicago.
