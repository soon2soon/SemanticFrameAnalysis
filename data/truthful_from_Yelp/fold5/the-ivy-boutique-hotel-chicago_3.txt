Ivy is a boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago - about 3 blocks from Michigan Avenue. The price point for hotels in Chicago during week before Christmas is quite low so there were a lot of options. This was a GREAT pick! Clean, modern, and luxurious. The reservations were made directly with the hotel, which they like and for that; an upgrade to a king sweet suite! There is something quite special about having a living room and a bedroom and a huge walk-in shower 11 floors above the fray of a big city. Â And during the busy holidays... all the better! I'm totally jazzed about this find. I'll gladly give up the Marriott points for the Ivy whenever I visit Chicago.
