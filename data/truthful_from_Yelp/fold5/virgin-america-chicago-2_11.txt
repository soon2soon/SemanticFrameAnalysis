I've flown with Virgin 5 round trips now and I'm spoiled!  Please, Virgin add Phoenix to your flights!  This is the Limo of coach flights and believe me their sales make it affordable for anyone!  I'm a pastry artist and they had an adorable u tube show in their free view repertoire showing artsy kids party cakes and cookies!  Loved it!  Virgin you are absolutely the BEST!
