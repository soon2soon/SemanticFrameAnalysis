We stayed last Saturday and it was our second stay in about a little over a month.  We were not able to get the same room we had last time (Blue Line room), so reserved a bigger room for a bit more money.  It was wonderful, spotless, cozy, all good!  There are many bars, restaurants, lots to do!  Love Wicker Park Inn.
