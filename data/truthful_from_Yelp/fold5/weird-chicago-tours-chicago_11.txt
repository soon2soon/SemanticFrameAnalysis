The Devil in the White City tour is Excellent! Superb! Informative! Fascinating! Totally worth the time and money. We took it on our last night in Chicago, which gave us a good overview of some spots we had missed on the trip. Expect to be in the Loop, Englewood, UIC area, etc etc. History buffs, architecture aficionados, horror hounds, crime story fans, weirdos, geeks, and people just looking for something more will love this. Our tour guide Eric was knowledgeable, funny, and friendly. Awesome tour!
