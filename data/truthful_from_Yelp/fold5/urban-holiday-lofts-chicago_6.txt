We stayed 4 nights while visiting Chicago last week. I was impressed with the location (great neighbourhood, close to the L train, many great coffee shops, bars, shops and restaurants nearby) and the cleanliness. The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. Although I was nervous about having to share a bathroom, it was no big deal as one was always free, so I never once had to wait. I'd definitely go back and would highly recommend this as an affordable, clean and well-situated place to stay.
