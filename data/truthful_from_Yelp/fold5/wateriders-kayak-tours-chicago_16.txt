Took advantage of a Groupon for the motorized kayak...aka Kayacht. It seats two and we had a blast!! The kayacht was awesome and very easy to operate, we were greeted with smiles from a very friendly staff. Kinda bummed that we did this so late in the season, but if the weather allows I will try to get one more 90 minute session. They give you a map route and the only issue is if there are larger boats out you get a little more motion than you may be prepared for. Overall just a fun experience and the customer service was just awesome!
