Need a passport in a hurry? Visa papers? Don't know if you need a Visa? Then let Travisa deal with all of your travel issues. Travisa is a global agency that works with passport offices and embassies around the world to expedite passport and visa applications. When you need to move quickly- Travisa cuts through all the red tape and gets you what you need well before you need it. I have used them in the past to help with getting Visas for China and they have always come through. This time- the request was a little easier- but it was a request that I didn't even know I needed until Travisa got involved. I am planning a European vacation at the end of this month. I thought I had all the necessary documents however it turns out with the new rules- my passport needed to have 6 months remaining on it from the time of my return date. It only had 5. One email to Travisa put things into action. Within a few hours they were back to me telling me what they needed, where to find the right forms and giving me the contact's name here in Chicago. I ran out at lunch, had a couple of pics taken and the packet was off to them in overnight mail. I also got an email when they received my packet and when my new passport was being shipped. The whole process to get a new passport took about 2 weeks. They aren't cheap (you are paying for their services on top of the passport fee- I think all in it ran about $240) but you are paying for piece of mind knowing that your trip that you've been planning will still go on as planned. Travisa prides itself on customer service. They do a great job no matter what the request. And if there are any delays from the countries that they are dealing with, they are up front and tell you where the delay is. Nothing better when you want to take the hassle out of international travel which is why so many companies use them around the world. If you have problems with your papers for international travel- try Travisa. I'm betting they can figure it out.
