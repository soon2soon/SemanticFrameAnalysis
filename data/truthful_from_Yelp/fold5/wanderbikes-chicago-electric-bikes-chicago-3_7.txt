Had a lovely day on our bikes!  We will be using this every time we are here in the city.  Wish we would have done this yesterday when we went to all the museums.  On our bikes, we went to Millennium Park, Navy Pier and a couple beaches.  Just followed the bike trails.  The bikes make our trip a lot more enjoyable today than all the walking yesterday!   The electric power makes all the difference.  So easy to use and cool for the kids.
