I cannot believe that it has taken me so long to write a review here!  Our honeymoon was almost a year ago (sorry for taking so long Kathy!!!) but we used Windy City Travel and Kathy was THE BEST!  She planned a 2 week trip to Australia for us that we will NEVER forget!  EVERYTHING was top notch!!!!  1st class all the way!!!!  We experienced things that most of the locals we met had only heard of and hoped to do some day!  It truly was the best trip we have ever taken!   When we plan on traveling abroad again (which will be soon!) - Kathy will be our go to for planning the best vacations imaginable!  I am sure that no matter what your budget, she will be able to make it work for you!   ABOVE AND BEYOND!  That's the service you will get!
