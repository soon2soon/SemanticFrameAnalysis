How much would you pay for perfection? That's what I have to consider when i review this hotel. I suppose it makes sense that my most expensive hotel stay pretty much ever is also my best ever! Having the perfect travel companion probably helped rather a lot too! The shower was amazing! (I now have a similar one in my flat!) And the bed was so comfortable (i now have a similar mattress). I didn't subsequently order in bulk the delicious cake bites that a member of staff brought to our room nor did I order a box of plasters of the type they gave me for me overwalked thus blistered foot, but that doesn't mean that both gestures were not most appreciated. Really liked the area the hotel was in too. Went to a couple of local places in the evening for food and drink. Despite the price I'll stay here again if I come to Chicago!
