The service here has been fantastic. The rooms themselves are large, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was the largest I've ever seen in a hotel room. The technology (panels) as well as the phone were a bit dated. I will go back to the service. The staff have gone way above for anything I needed (including a late night shoe shine). Very much recommend the property.
