Holy crap, I'm not even a baseball fan and I thought the tour was AWESOME. Sitting in the bleachers on a sunny day was great. Checking out the press box and the box seats were pretty cool, too.  But going to the locker room, sitting in the clubhouse, and walking on the field... just phenomenal. Above all else, the sense of history was amazing.  A must see if you are a sports fan.
