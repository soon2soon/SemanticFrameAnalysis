The Talbott is home away from home. From the minute you walk in there is an inviting atmosphere that makes you feel like you never want to leave. The hotel was decorated for be Christmas holidays, with two fireplaces. The fireplaces and lounge area around them were great to warm up with a glass of wine. The staff is superb, very accommodating. They were able to accommodate my very early check in. Gene the concierge was excellent, was extremely nice and had great suggestions on places to go. The hotel has an old worlds charm, loved all the wood finishes and the vintage decor. The rooms are cozy, and very comfortable. They have Apple TV and also control the in room computer. I found this very helpful. The Keurig machine was an added plus, very easy to use and convenient. Overall a great experience and great hotel. Can't wait to come back. Definitely my home away from home when I visit Chicago.
