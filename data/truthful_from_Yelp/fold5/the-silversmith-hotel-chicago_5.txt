Wonderful experience from time of check/in to check-out. Other reviewers commented on the silver theme... I thought it was tastefully executed and a beautiful retreat. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Loved the bathroom! If looking to stay near shopping and theaters, take a look at this hotel!
