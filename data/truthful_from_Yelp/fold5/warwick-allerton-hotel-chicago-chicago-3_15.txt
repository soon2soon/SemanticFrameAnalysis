My husband and I recently celebrated our wedding at The Allerton and we could not be happier with the experience. Beau, our wedding planner, was attentive and helpful throughout the planning process. He certainly won over my parents! Our guests are still raving about the accommodations, food and view! If you're looking to get married, or host any event, in downtown Chicago, definitely check out this relatively untapped gem.
