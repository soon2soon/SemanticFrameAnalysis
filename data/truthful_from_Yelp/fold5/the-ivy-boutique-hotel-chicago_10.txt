Amazing hotel! I can not say enough good things about this beautiful hotel. We stayed in the king suite which offered almost 700 sf of space. The bed was excellent and the amenities were first class. Push button drapery, deep soaker tub, rain shower head and even a tv in the bathroom mirror! Turn down service was a nice touch as well. Extremely modern and clean the only downfall was the cold but we were there in Jan so that was our own fault! When your hotel room has a doorbell you know you are going to be treated right! The food is also top notch we will definitely stay here for our next visit to Chicago oh and located close to all the great shops and restaurants!!
