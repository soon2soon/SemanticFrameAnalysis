Newly opened Virgin hotel exceeded my expectations. Â I arrived at 5am and was able to check in. They even read my profile and greeted me with Pirates Booty (my fave snack) and a signed card. Bed was comfy and its design is ingenious! The room was very large and the use of space was perfect. Bathroom was huge! House car is a Tesla where guests can be driven to any location within a 2 mile radius. Mini bar prices are similar/better than 7-11-- large Voss water only $2! Bottle of belvedere was $18. All little touches did not go unnoticed. Service was accommodating and prompt. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
