I was flying in from Colorado late Friday night and needed to find a place to stay. I'm visiting friends who live near Wrigley Field and so I googled hotels nearby. The first place that came up was Wrigley Hostel. I've never stayed in a hostel before, but the price was right and it was only a half block from Wrigley Field! I booked a bed from my phone and got a cab. I was worried they would be upset with me because I didn't arrive until almost 4 AM, but instead I was greeted with a smile! Everyone there was so nice and they got me checked in and in my bed within minutes of arriving. The hostel is small, but very friendly and clean. In the morning there was a large breakfast bar and tons of fun people to meet and chat with. I would definitely stay at Wrigley Hostel again-- the price, the people, and the fun atmosphere are (wait for it) a home run!
