soooo I must sing all the rave's of Ryan! Sunset & Ryan came recommended by a friend after an all out shout out on FB for a travel agent... and he did NOT disappoint. I had been looking for a cruise and after what seemed like tons of searching when I went to confirm it locked me out and seem to get $300 more expensive- imagine my dismay and frantic panic. Ryan was not only able to book it for me but even saved me a few bucks from my original hunt- not to mention the now increased booking price. I have found my new agent and as a creature of habit and a loyal label whore this will be a very loooooong relationship! Â THNX RYAN!!!!!! i'll send you a post card from the water.
