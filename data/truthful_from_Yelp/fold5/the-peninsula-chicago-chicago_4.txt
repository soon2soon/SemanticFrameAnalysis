i recently had a deep tissue massage at the peninsula and it was wonderful. Â valerie was great, she educated me on anything i asked her about and even provided some recommendations for a few aches and pains. it is costly, though if you want to treat yourself and also spend some time in the wonderful entire spa area, i recommend it, and i recommend valerie
