Being the cheapest person you ever want to meet, I actually got quotes from 3 travel agencies for my Trip to Italy and Greece to see who would get me the best deal.  By a long shot, Marcie Allison at Windy City Travel was the least expensive.  Furthermore, the hotels that they booked were higher rated and better reviewed than the other 2 agencies. The trip went great, Marcie is very service oriented, and I would definitely book through Windy City and use Marcie again!
