We booked the 4.5 star hotel on Priceline.com (bidding), got a great deal Location: great location, just steps from the Mag Mile.  Across the street was trader joe's got drinks, alcohol, and snacks for the weekend.  Got to explore most of the town with only walking.   Very close to the blue line.  saved money by taking the blue line and getting off at monroe blue and taking a cab to the hotel.  Taxi and airport express were really expensive staff: great staff, everyone was extremely courteous Service: didn't expect the turn down service but that was a nice surprise, no complaints!!! Hotel: loved the chic boutique look, room was spacious would stay here again for the right price
