Stayed at The Talbott for three nights over a weekend in late September. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, and the hotel lobby and room were very nice. It is in a great location, as we were able to easily walk to shops, restaurants, bars, and the red line via Chicago Ave (which made it easy to get to Wrigley and US Cellular Field). I highly recommend The Talbott, if you're looking for a great place to stay near north side in Chicago. I will stay there again next time I visit.
