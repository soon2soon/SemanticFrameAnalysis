Love. I stayed here with friends who were in town visiting for a girls weekend. This was a great choice. Tuscan room, private entrance, private bath, felt as though we were hanging out at a friend's house all weekend. Perfect location for getting out and about for dining and debauchery but also quaint inside for lounging and watching a bit of horrible TV (they have cable). Staff is incredibly nice and they do a great job taking care of the inn. I appreciate little special touches like complimentary makeup remover wipes in the bathroom and free parking passes! I don't typically like continental breakfasts and I definitely don't usually like interacting with other guests in the morning. However, the breakfast at the Inn was nice because they had a little something for everyone and the table was set quite nicely. We met some people from Brazil and it wasn't as weird as you might think having breakfast in your pj's with strangers might be. Definitely recommend this place not only for your guests but for yourself. Playing tourist in your own city has its perks!
