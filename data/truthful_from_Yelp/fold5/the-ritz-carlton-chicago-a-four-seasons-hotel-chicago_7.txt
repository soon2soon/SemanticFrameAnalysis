Perhaps I am biased as I have so many great memories here at the Chicago Ritz, but I love this hotel! The service is always impeccable. The rooms are spacious, clean and beautiful. I have stayed in the rooms as well as attended several parties held here. --They know how to throw a lavish party! The food perfect and the decor gorgeous. And the views... the views are beautiful. You know when you wake up at the Ritz, you're bound to have a great day; it just can't be helped.
