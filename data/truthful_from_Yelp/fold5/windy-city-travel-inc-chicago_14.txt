I'm very experience in booking tripsl (as I do this for my job) but decided to use a travel agent for my destination wedding, as I was strongly encouraged by other brides.  I am SO happy about my decision to do so and my choice of travel agents.  Marcie at WCT has been extremely helpful and has saved me over 1000 dollars on my wedding / honeymoon itinerary.  I will definitely use them again in the future!
