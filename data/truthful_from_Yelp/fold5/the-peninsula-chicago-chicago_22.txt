Can't speak for anything but the Chocolate Buffet. As for that Chocolate Buffet... I don't have any credentials that certify me as even half the chocoholic people think I am, but I know a thing or two about the stuff. At least, I THOUGHT I did until the night I tried that buffet. These were the softest, smoothest, creamiest desserts I've ever had, hands down. The tarts especially blew me away. That was also the first time I had ever been moved to tears by food (disregarding onions and spicy food). I never believed I could eat something so good that I would cry until that night. It's pricey for most, but $50 for a potentially life-changing experience is a great deal in my book.
