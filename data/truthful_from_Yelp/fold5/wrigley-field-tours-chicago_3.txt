While I live a block from the bleachers, I am not at all a baseball or Cubs fan.  However, I am a fan of useless trivia, and  Wrigley Field Tours gave me a ton of mindless facts not only about the Cubs but about baseball in general.   The tour is informative and interesting.  I never knew how many baseball traditions started in our Friendly Confines.   You walk all over the stadium - the bleachers, press box and even the locker room if there isn't a game that day.  My only warning is that you do need to walk quite a bit , on ramps and stairs, so if someone is not completely mobile, this tour may be too hard for them.   I highly recommend this tour for anyone, not just baseball aficionados.
