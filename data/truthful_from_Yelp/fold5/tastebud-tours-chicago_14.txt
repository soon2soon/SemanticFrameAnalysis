I think I've become a food tour addict! I live in the Chicago suburbs, but Â I had previously gone on two other food tours in the city, and I was a little weary about going on one with a company I was not familiar with. My cousin and her family were in town from California, so I thought this would be a really fun activity for her family, me and my husband. We started our tour at Pizzanos with AnnaLyn and Lynn (the owner), and from the beginning they made the tour awesome! I was a little skeptical when Lynn made a point saying that they treated all their tours "like family"....we could take bathroom breaks when we wanted, we could shop when we wanted....all these things were restricted in the other food tours I've taken. Well....AnnaLyn and Lynn really stuck to their word! They both got to know all of us on the tour, and really did treat us like family! I think the reason they were able to do this is because they were still starting out as a company and had a great relationship with all the owners of the establishments we went to. I was also very hesitant about the amount of food that we got to eat....there were some HEAVY things and I thought we'd be rolling around the city by the time we were done, but the pace and the distance between the locations helped a LOT! We definitely didn't walk away hungry! I'm SO happy that we decided to take a tour with Tasebud Tours! They were great hosts and showed my family a great time in the city! We can't wait to go on their upcoming Sweets tour!!!
