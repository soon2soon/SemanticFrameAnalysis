My method for checking hotels is: drop a pin on all the attractions I'm interested in checking out, add hotels to the map, filter by price, go to Tripadvisor and check out the reviews.  Let me just save you all that time and tell you to book this place.   It's a couple of blocks from the Bean, Millennium Park, the river, etc.  A train stop is LITERALLY 15 feet from the main entrance of the hotel.  We were in Chicago for 3 days and never once took a cab.  Not just because so much was within walking distance of our hotel, but because the public transportation is awesome, and with a stop right outside your door, you don't have to worry about a car. The hotel itself is also nice- modern, cozy, clean.  And the bed was super comfy which is always a plus!
