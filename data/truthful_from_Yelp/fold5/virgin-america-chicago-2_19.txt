Best domestic airline by far. The prices are decent and they occasionally are the best deal. Free dish tv on flight and the option to pay for internet/movies/tv... I've flown the LAX to CHO and LAX to NYC routes and they are by far the best. I also like how they have the friendliest staff by far. Richard Branson is my idol.
