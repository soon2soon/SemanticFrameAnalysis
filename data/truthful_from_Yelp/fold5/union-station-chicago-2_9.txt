I have been using this station for over 20 years & I have no complaints. It is not very hard to get around & every exit you walk out of will bring you right into the heart of the city of Chicago. The place is kept pretty clean & does not have pan handlers walking around. There is a bar inside that is great to have a quick drink before a train ride. There are also a bunch of little restaurants to grab a over priced meal on the run. The train conductors are all very nice & helpful. The building itself is gorgeous & has a great history to it. I have also taken Wedding pictures here which turned out great & no one gave us any b.s for taking them in there. The place is a must see when in Chicago.
