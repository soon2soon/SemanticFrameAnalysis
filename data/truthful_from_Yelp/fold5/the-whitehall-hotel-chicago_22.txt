We spent our honeymoon here. The location is perfect - half a block away from magnificent mile and the Hancock building. Upon arrival we mentioned our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a junior suite for free. The decorum is older as it is a historical hotel, but it is still very nice. Road noise was slight because we are in the city, but it didn't impose on our sleep.
