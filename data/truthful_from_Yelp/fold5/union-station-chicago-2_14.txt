It's so lovely. The architecture is definitely worth snapping a few photos. Wait.... why am I writing a yelp review about a train station? Why did I give it 5 stars? I like to travel and have a double life. I travel from CLE to CHI back and forth. Here's some advice. Get there a few minutes early. Take some pictures. Don't talk to pan handlers. Don't go number two in the restrooms. Select a tasty NS beverage from one of the vendors for your ride.
