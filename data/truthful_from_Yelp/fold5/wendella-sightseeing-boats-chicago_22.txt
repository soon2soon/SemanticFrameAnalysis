I'm urban at heart. I live for architecture. I love Chicago. And, I sure do miss it since I moved to the North Shore. Though I come to the city every chance I get, there is nothing better...I repeat NOTHING BETTER than taking a boat cruise in the evening. A bunch of us from my company took a sightseeing tour the other night. After all the years of living in the city I'm shocked that I never considered doing this. Having this opportunity was a royal treat. Though the energy of the city is amazing during the day, in the dark the tall lit buildings glisten. The experience is magical. Looking up at the Sears tower watching camera flashes go off at the observation deck. Being in the middle of the lake looking over at the ferris wheel at Navy Pier. These particular views you can only see on a boat. The cruise director was fascinating to listen to regarding the various buildings and stories about the city. My favorite was the one about the Civic Opera House (you'll have to take the cruise to find out). The sound quality was fantastic from everywhere on the boat. There was a bar on the lower level with bathrooms. I want to go again and again and again! I encourage anyone and everyone to just do this. Don't think about it. Just go. GO!!
