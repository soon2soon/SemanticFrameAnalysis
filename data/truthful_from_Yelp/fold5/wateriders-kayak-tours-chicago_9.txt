Had some friends in town and didn't know what to do. Luckily, some genius thought of the idea of taking a river tour on the Kayak. Aka kayaking the river (the Chicago River). Man, Aaron sure was a blast and a half as he told us all about the architecture we saw. I did not know any facts and now I know many facts. Plus he was funny, too. Time flew by and now all I have are happy memories and sore arms.
