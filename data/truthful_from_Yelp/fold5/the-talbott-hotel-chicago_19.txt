Upon my arrival I was upgraded to a suite by the front desk. The hotel has a very quant feeling to it. The lobby is invitingly warm and charming. The staff were attentive and very helpful. I was given a room on the 4th floor. My room was beautiful. The king bed was amazing. The pillows were wonderful along with the comforter and sheets. Soft as butter. The bathroom was made perfect as there was a make up mirror attached to the bathroom mirror. This is beyond wonderful when you wear contacts and can not see up close. The shower was terrific....The closet was a walk in. It was big enough to keep my huge suite case open on the floor. It had a good amount of hanging space for my clothes that needed hanging up. I loved the placement of the TV on the wall. I did have some problems with the cable freezing up now and then while I was watching it. No big deal. I had room service several times and thought the food was very good. Â I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will definitely return. Thumbs up!!!
