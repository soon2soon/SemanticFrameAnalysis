Just finished my first boat trip with TikiBoat Chicago.  It was one of the best trips I've had touring the Chicago River and Lake Michigan.  The boat was great and big enough to comfortably  fit our entire party. When we dropped anchor, we they even had a water slide we could use. So much fun. A special thanks to Captain William for making the trip so much fun.
