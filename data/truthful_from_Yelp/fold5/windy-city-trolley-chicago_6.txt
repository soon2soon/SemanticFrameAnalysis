Renting a trolley from Windy City Trolley was an awesome experience. It was my fiances birthday.. and I didn't know what to do... then it dawned on me, that a fun way to celebrate his birthday in Chicago would be to rent out a trolley!! Windy City Trolley staff was so nice to me... they communicated very well and always made sure I was happy and answered my questions really well. The driver, Tim was soooo much fun! He knew how to make us happy. He was very nice! I am so happy I chose Windy City Trolley and its very VERY affordable. They played my Tupac cd... we had a blast enjoying our drinks in the trolley... it was craziness. My friends said that this was one party they will never forget! On top of that my fiance said this was the best birthday party he has ever had in his life!! I highly recommend Windy City Trolley and Tim as your driver :) I LOVE WINDY CITY TROLLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
