This and the Chicago Film Tour are heads above the rest of the tours I've taken in Chicago. On this tour I learned way more about gangsters than I ever thought of. There was also a lot of Chicago history, some architecture, and other nice tidbits thrown in. I now know what a 'sicilian necktie' is. Unfortunately the city tore down most of the actual buildings where stuff took place, but the guides were so entertaining and smooth with their delivery that I wasn't bothered by it. I'm sure ever ride is a little different depending one what guide you get, traffic flow, weather, etc. However, I had an absolute blast!
