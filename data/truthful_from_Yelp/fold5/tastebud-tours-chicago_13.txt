I found Tastebud tours online searching for food tours of Chicago. My husband and I were NOT disappointed! It was really delicious and informative. We learned a lot about the history of Chicago as well as sampling some of its finest cuisine. We ate at seven different locations and made an additional stop at The Drake Hotel. Andrew, our tour guide was really easy to talk to, was entertaining, and was incredibly knowledgeable about Chicago. My husband's favorite was the Chicago Dog from Downtown Dogs, and mine of course was the brownie from L'Appetito and the chocolate from Fannie May. Our tour which was scheduled for 3 hours actually took a bit longer, almost four, but never once did we feel rushed or pushed along for time. We enjoyed all the walking in between the stops for food, to help digest a little before eating more. I would HIGHLY recommend this tour to anyone who is interested in sampling some excellent local cuisine, and learning a little of Chicago's fascinating history and stories! Amy and AJ Vazifdar
