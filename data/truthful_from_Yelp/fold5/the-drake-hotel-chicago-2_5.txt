High Tea Experience ONLY! My friend organized a birthday high tea experience for 8 ladies, plus an infant on a Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. For 40 dollars per person- 50 included the tax and gratuaity- it was the best time. Service- Impeccable. In a filled large dining where there was an engagment party to all sorts of small to large groups like ours, the properly dressed 'English' men were coming around to ask how we were doing, taking pictures, filling our tea kettles filled, and any extra orders of tea sandwitches, bread, and desserts were arriving. Food and Tea- From the petite turkey and salmon sandwitches, to fall pumpkin and huzelut bites, to the soft and crunchy bread with dipping jam, lemon curd, and whipped butter- all of us happilly were filling our tummies. With delicious tea options- the price and service and presentation of everything was just perfect. I definately want to come back- maybe for a Mother's Day treat and if any one ever wanted to throw me a baby shower there- I would be so happy! Haha.
