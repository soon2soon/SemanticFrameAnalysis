Exceptional stay on all fronts. The pool was a picture of serenity. The room was wonderful and had a great view of the Lake. The restaurant Deca continued the streak of perfection with a perfect breakfast. It was bitter cold when we were there, so taking the elevator down to shop and eat in the Water Tower was something that made our stay here that much better
