What's not to like? Beautiful place, perfect location and amazing service, ammenities and things to do. Besides food and drink, they also have an ice rink in the winter, spa, pool and dining area with carolers most of the day and live music at night. Rooms are elegant and understated. Beds are fantastic and comfortable along with the pillows and comforters - and it's quiet. No paper walls here - old school construction. Just a great hotel that we're lucky to be able to enjoy for the holidays - we like to stay the day after Christmas. Â A great experience and nice touch that the staff knew it was my birthday and snuck in a chocolate BDay cake for me. Thank you - and we plan on being back again next year.
