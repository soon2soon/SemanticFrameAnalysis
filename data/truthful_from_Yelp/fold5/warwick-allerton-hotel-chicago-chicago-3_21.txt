I'm writing this review as a Chicago bride who just had her wedding at the Allerton on April 13 (and stayed there for 2 nights).  I cannot recommend the Allerton highly enough. In fact, I don't know why someone would choose to get married anywhere else in Chicago.  The Tip Top Tap, where we had our ceremony and reception, looked absolutely beautiful on the day of the wedding.  The food at the cocktail hour, the reception, and the brunch the following day was amazing--our guests are still raving about it.  The service was impeccable. And we were basically treated like royalty.  Our rooms were clean and amazingly spacious.  We booked the Allerton about 13 months before our wedding, and Beau was our contact.  Beau is basically a saint and is always so cheerful and upbeat despite having to deal with (sometimes) demanding brides like myself.  He was always extremely helpful and answered questions promptly.  If minor issues came up, he was always very quick to address and resolve them.  He really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great day, and we absolutely did.
