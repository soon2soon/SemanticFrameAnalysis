Did the classic kayak tour, had a group of about 17. Â Our tour guide Joel was very knowledgeable and personable. He also spoke loud enough everybody could hear; even with trains passing overhead and boats near by which was nice to be able to hear. The tour itself is about a 5 mile round trip but you make stops along the way where they explain the history or importance of that particular location. I felt they did a good job explaining how to kayak for the beginners and their equipment is good shape, which is nice. They have plenty of different size life jackets and single and double kayaks to rent. They also offer free water which is needed while kayaking for a few hours. One thing they offered which I did not expect was sunblock, just a nice touch.
