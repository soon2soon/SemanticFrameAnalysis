Great place to rent a kayak for a couple of hours. or take a tour. Perfect activity for a local or for tourists.Convenient location and easy ride south to the main branch of the Chicago River. The views from the river are incredible...below the Trump Towers is sunning, right where the river T's is also really cool with the giant Merchandise Mart and beautiful Nuveen building. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I felt Joshua gave a great introduction to kayaking and provided helpful advise on how to kayak with the boat traffic. Dan who checked in the kayers was professional, friendly and helpful as well. I kayaked on a beautiful weekend day and found although there was a great deal of boat traffic it was great fun and the waves from the boats made it much more entertaining than in flat water. I have used other kayak companies as I live in the city and have found Waterriders to be the most affordable with a convenient location. Definitely a great activity for an afternoon in the city.
