I love Chicago at The Drake during Christmas time for multiple reasons.  The hotel is beautifully decorated.  It makes people smile. My deluxe king room is magnificant, just lovely - a view of the city skyline and Lake Michigan. Ask for a room as high as available.  From the 7th floor I want to look out of the window all day and night. Who cares to go out?! The room has a stocked fridge with drinks, which I temporarily remove for my items; there is no microwave. There are good restaurants and a bar on the premises. Christmas Day dinner is always delicious; festivities are kicked up with Santa and carolers. Each year the menu is totally different. Service is warm and friendly, experienced. The hotel is located on the Gold Coast, convenient to your favorite department stores, restaurants and drinking establishments. Each year I find new places to enjoy. The vallet parking (via the Drive-in Special) is handy and is less costly than the nearby $42/day self-parking lot. Everyone who has provided services has been friendly and professional. This is a lot of value for the cost. I would give this hotel 4.5 stars, if halves could be awarded, not 5 stars. The amenities could be updated a bit, e.g., a lamp on the night stand flickers and fails to stay on (plenty of other lights), there is an old [1980s? haha] hair dryer available to use, the make-up mirror in the bathroom is loosely connected to the bracket that needs attention (although functional), etc. These are minor items, yet a 5-star hotel attends to these needs.
