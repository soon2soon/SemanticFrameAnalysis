This is very late but I had my reception at the Tip Top Tap Ballroom back in May. It was beyond what I could imagine. They made all my ideas become a reality. I was so impressed with how beautiful the room looked and how amazing the service was. I literally did not have to stress out about anything with the hotel because they had it covered. Sherri, the hotel wedding coordinator/planner was one of the best I have ever seen or met. She literally does a lot of the hard work for you and not request goes missed. I was so happy to be able to work with her. If you are thinking of a downtown wedding, I 100% recommend the Allerton Hotel. We also received a complimentary suite after the reception, which was also amazing. They set up nice surprises and packed everything from the wedding and delivered it to our room. Another awesome perk, for your one year, they give you a free complimentary room again to celebrate your anniversary. What more could you ask for! Thank you Sherri and all your staff for making my dream wedding a reality!!!!
