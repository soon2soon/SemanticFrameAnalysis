In November, I stayed in the Ceasar's room, which is in the basement. It does not feel like a basement at all, very nice and you get a mini fridge and microwave. Cathy is as great as the other reviews say. I do wish they were more aware of what is gluten free and what is not. I had contacted them to let them know this was an allergy of mine, and it all seemed fine. While I was there, though, it was hard to get a straight answer about what was in the egg dish. I ended up boiling my own eggs, which is fine. It is pretty easy to learn about gluten allergies. But! The kitchen is great and they don't seem to mind if you use it. Â I would stay there again, and I hope to.
