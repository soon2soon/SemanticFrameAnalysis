This was a great time!  Our docent was full of fun facts and she filled us all in on all the sites. We bought our tickets online (ticketmaster surcharge) because we planned out the day ahead of time.  The seating is first come first serve, so we got in line early.  We sat on top and there is no shade but that was ok since it was about 50 degrees outside. They have a bar here (yippee) and a bathroom, so you can really kick back and enjoy yourself.  The seating is individual seats, not the benches like other boats I saw.  When I see those benches I think of being packed in like sardines as we all know they try and cram in as many people as possible. Back to the tour....it was very enjoyable and a great way to learn about the city.  Even my teenage boys liked it and that says a lot1
