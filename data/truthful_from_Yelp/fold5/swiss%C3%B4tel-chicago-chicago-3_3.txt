This hotel has been renovated and it's beautiful. The location is amazing - near restaurants and shopping and an amazing view of the Navy Pier. The rooms themselves are now modern and pleasing, and once you figure out how to use the elevator system (you type in your floor number and it shuffles you into an elevator) it's quite efficient. It's also handy having a UPS office as part of the business center. Breakfast is delicious and the service is kind and helpful. In fact, everyone I encountered in this hotel greeted me with a smile and helped in any way they could. Wonderful hotel - definitely worth a stay!
