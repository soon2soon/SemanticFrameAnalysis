I just got back from the Talbott, it was my second stay here, and it was great. Really, really great. It's such a deal, and this time we were upgraded to a suite that was just perfect. Two rooms, separated by a hallway, a great shower, separated sinks, very comfortable bed. And the service was outstanding. And the location couldn't get any better, either. So why is it such a great deal? Well, it does seem a little dated. Though to be honest, I'd much prefer how everything was laid out well, a good living space, and all the designs for the wallpaper/paintings/bed/etc be very nice than have higher quality, new or updated furniture, but then have all that other stuff be a second thought. At the Talbott, nothing seems like a second thought. Also, you get a complimentary pass for the Equinox gym which is very nice. All in all, I plan to return and I would much rather stay in a suite here than some average room at the Ritz or the Four Seasons. Keep up the good work, Talbott, and thank you for the upgrade.
