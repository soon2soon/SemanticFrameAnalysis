This hotel is excellent. The rooms are clean, comfortable and elegant. Everything is high quality, from the shampoo, conditioner and soap to the Mac computer and keyboard. The service is superb. I've stayed in over 100 hotels across the U.S. but I've never seen a staff that competent, helpful and pleasant which says a lot about the management and work environment. It really is not an exaggeration when I say every single employee here went out of their way to help (the front desk, the cleaning ladies, the concierge staff). One thing could be little improved: the Internet connection. All in all, it is exceptional and I will be coming back for sure.
