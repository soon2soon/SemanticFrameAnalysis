My mom came into town and wanted a tour, so we booked one with Weird Chicago Tours. Our tour guide, Eric, was great--- theatrical, funny, and weird. We learned a lot more about the city that we didn't know. My mom had a great time, which is the most important, but my husband even enjoyed it and I wasn't sure he would. We wanted to do the Blood, Guns & Valentines Tour but we only had 1 night free and that happended to be the Weird & Haunted Tour. We did get some gangster stories and some HH Holmes info, too, so we were happy. We went all over the city-- downtown, the Congress Hotel, the theater district, northside, Lincoln Park--- it was cool. Lots of creepy deaths here in Chicago! Mom wants to do the Blood, Guns & Valentines Tour next time she's in town.
