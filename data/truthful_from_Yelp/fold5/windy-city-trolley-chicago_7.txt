We hired Windy City Trolley for our 10/23/10 wedding.  They were great.  They were prompt, trolley was cute, it came with an ipod hookup so we have music, and we were able to bring drinks with us (in non-glass containers).  The trolley is not the most comfortable ride ever, but it was no more uncomfortable than any other trolley I have experienced.  All of our bridal party had a blast, and I am excited to see our photos!
