My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a Valentine's Day trip and had a wonderful experience! The room was gorgeous, and we updated our suite to a room with city views, it was absolutely gorgeous (we evenly liked the look of bathroom!) We got a package which included the parking, and for the quality, I think the price was very reasonable, and definitely worth it. Especially compared to other hotels in the area which were going for much higher for the holiday. We planned our activities around the hotel, because it was so close to everything. We had a great time at the Shedd Aquarium, we had dinner at the House of Blue's, and then drinks in the Signature Room. Overall we had a excellent experience, and would definitely recommend and return to this hotel again.
