Really, I couldn't have asked much more of this tour. At $25 a pop, the price seemed a little steep, but that ticket gave me a complete tour of the park that lasted well over 90 minutes. Let me give you a rundown of what I saw: - 5 minute intro video - Sat in the bleachers while getting a Cubs history lesson - Stood in the visitors' clubhouse - Sat in the press box and walk past all the broadcast booths - Sat in a box seat - Saw the Cubs' clubhouse - Sat in both dugouts - Walked on the field along the dirt track behind home plate There isn't one section of the park that this tour doesn't take you to--exactly what a tour of a ballpark should be. I've been to Wrigley many times already, but the behind-the-scenes visits were really fun. Checking Â out the box seats and the press box were interesting, but the real treat was the dugout/field experience at the end. Amazing. The tour guides just let you do your own thing down there and let you take it all in. Drinking from the home dugout's water fountain and sitting on the bench was awesome. If you are into baseball at all, this tour is very, VERY worthwhile. The tour guide was great. Told an interesting, complete history of the ballpark and had a ton of interesting tidbits about the field, the Cubs, the Bears and anything else pertaining to Wrigley. Having him casually tell you that you are sitting in the same box seats that Ronald Regan, Bill Clinton and Michael Jordan sat in made me smile. Expect the usual tour-guide-caliber jokes, though a couple of them made me smile. A couple of years ago I went on a tour of Fenway Park and loved it (Note: I HATE Boston sports). I can unbiased say that the Wrigley tour blows that tour out of the water (and honestly at twice the price, it probably should). There was a lot I didn't get to see at Fenway, but this tour covered all the bases. Unable to top that pun, I'm ending the review there! If you are interested in the tour, go! You won't be disappointed.
