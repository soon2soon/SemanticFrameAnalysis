Forgive me while I rave about this hotel!! I am a corporate events manager who hosts and plans events all the time, and I gotta tell you this was one of the best corporate retreats I've ever been a part of in terms of organization and communication with the hotel staff.  Rachel from special events is a rock star, she bent over backwards to help us out any time we needed it and was so friendly.   Anthony and Brendon at the front desk were amazing, and even Lisette, the bartender for our final night was so awesome and friendly.  Gotta give a shout out to David the banquet manager as well, our event went off without a hitch. Additionally, the hotel itself is gorgeous, the rooms are incredible, and the location is perfect.  Short walk to many of Chicago's best sights and restaurants. Can't wait to return, I highly recommend them for personal or corporate/special event travel.
