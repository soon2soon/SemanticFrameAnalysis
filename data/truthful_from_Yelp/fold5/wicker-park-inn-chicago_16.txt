Awesome! We stayed both in the "Wicker Park Room" for like two days. It was nice, reasonably priced. Nothing spectacular. But we came back for another part of the trip and then opted for the "Blue Line Studio" and thought way way way higher of it. The sound of the blue line el going by isn't bad at all, it didn't bother either of us. It's the cheapest room there and absolutely worth it. Free food and toast! Do it up!
