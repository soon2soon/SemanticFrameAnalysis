We went to a wedding last weekend and found it totally amazing!  The ceremony was elegant with white fresh flowers everywhere.  The lighting was romantic and the setting was intimate. Cocktails started at 6:30 and we had the most amazing appetizers: Crab cakes A savory panna cotta with caviar Mushroom crostini When dinner was served, the 4 wait staff approached each table of 8 and synchronized the placement each plate in front of each guest. Tender filet cooked just right...not overlooked and not too red and rare. Water, wine & champagne glasses were constantly refilled.
