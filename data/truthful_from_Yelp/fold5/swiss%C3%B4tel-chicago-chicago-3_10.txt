I am from Chicago, and I wanted to get a room for my birthday as a treat for myself. I wanted a nice King Bed, good views of the city, and a pool with a hot tub. I got a Corner King Room on expedia. When I got there, the concierge noticed it was my birthday, which is nice. He claimed Â a Corner King on the 4th floor was the only one left. I can't recall exactly my response but I made it clear that was disappointing for me. After two minutes of him clicking around on the computer, he said he found a corner king suite, and he would give it to me. I was very happy to get the upgrade. Expedia sort of misled me into believing the room would "over look the city", and I am so glad Swiss Hotel made it right with no charge or effort. The room was better than I expected it would be, 3304. The best thing is the view. It looked over Lake Michigan, Navy Pier, the river, and some downtown area, including the Trump Tower. There "may" be better views out there, but this was awesome and breath taking, and was 100% satisfied with the view. It was actually a foggy day and I still was impressed. The room had two bathrooms, a living area with a tv, a separate bedroom with a tv and with window, and another bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The bed was great, very comfortable. The room would impress anyone I know. It has all the bells and whistles one could expect for a hotel to have. It's not clear to me if they charge for internet or not or pool access, but they didn't charge me. The pool is on the top floor, and is wheelchair accessible. The pool is about 3.5 feet deep all across, which is fine by me. Very nice temp and chlorine levels did not bother me. All I really ask for is a hot tub, and this one was great because you can sit in it and look at navy pier and the lake. There is also a great workout room also with views, and a sauna. I will be back some day.
