Flew out of ORD to SFO on Virgin America last month. I've been flying Virgin America almost exclusively for domestic flights the past couple of years. I love that everyone has their own TV to watch. It makes a long flight go that much faster. Plus the in seat ordering from your TV makes everything so much easier. And if you want to be on your phone, tablet, laptop, etc, the whole flight, they have plugs at every seat! If you fly Virgin America a lot, it might be worth it to look into a credit card. I have the one that's a $49 annual fee and you get a free checked bag for yourself and a companion if they are booked on the same reservation. Another plus? You get a $150 companion credit to apply towards a round trip airfare. That more than enough pays for the annual fee. Plus you get the companion credit every year after you pay your annual fee. Last time I flew, I was hungry, so I got one of their meal packs. The Heineken & Hearty meal. The hearty meal comes with beef salami, crackers, cheddar cheese, pretzel crisps, Welch's fruit snacks and roasted salted chickpeas. Now I wouldn't call the meal hearty. Or even a meal. It was more of a snack box. But with my CC, I got 20% off my in flight purchase. No airline is perfect. But I have to say Virgin America is one of my favs!
