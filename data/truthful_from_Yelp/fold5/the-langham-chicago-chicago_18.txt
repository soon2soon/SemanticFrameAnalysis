My husband surprised me with afternoon tea at the Pavilion, located on the 2nd floor of the Langham Hotel, for my birthday.  The tea area was beautiful and everyone was so attentive.  I never knew there was a tea sommelier, but I guess you learn something new everyday.  I only drank decaf teas since I'm pregnant, but they were so good.  I had the Vanilla Roobios and the Emperor's Chamomile.  I really wish they sold these teas.  My favorite parts were the finger sandwiches (deviled egg salad!) and the scones with jam and devonshire cream.  The dessert course was just ok, I'd rather have another plate of sandwiches.  There really isn't much of a view since all you really see is the trump tower and part of the Chicago River, but it was a beautiful experience.  I'd highly recommend everyone try afternoon tea at the Pavillion, it's very good.
