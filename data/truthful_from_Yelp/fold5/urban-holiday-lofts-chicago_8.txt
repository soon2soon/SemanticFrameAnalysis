We had an excellent stay here! It was very clean and secure, which is what you hope for with a hostel. A friend and I got a private room, which was small with only a bunk bed and desk, though it was plenty big for our needs. There were shared bathrooms - two per floor - and I never had to wait to use one. There was also a common kitchen area with a fridge, sink and microwave. The decor is very modern and trendy, and I believe the entire place is just a converted warehouse. The staff was friendly and helpful when we asked about the area. (We ended up going to an AMAZING Indian place for dinner called Rangoli that was a ten minute walk away). Beware of parking. It is only available on the street and some of it in the area is not allowed overnight. I would recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere as a home base for exploring. You're not going to spend a lot of time here with such amazing bars and restaurants nearby!
