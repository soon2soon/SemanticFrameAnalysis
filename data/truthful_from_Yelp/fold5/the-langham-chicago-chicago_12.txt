I needed a quick getaway weekend before it gets really cold in Chicago. I invited one of my best friend to accompany me to Chicago. We stayed here at the Langham in the Club Suite. The Langham Club suite was perfect. I was able to invite friends over since I had a living room with a half bath and they didn't need to go into my room. This suite is very chic and modern. I enjoyed the bathroom - it was so spacious! Perfect lighting to put our makeup on and get ready for a night out on the town. Also, our bathroom had a huge garden tub with Jacuzzi and a waterfall shower. This room was planned out wonderful. We had turn down service which was great. The staff here was wonderful as well. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying here. We also went downstairs to the bar and to the restaurant a few times because we were kind of lazy on going outside to find something to eat. Everything we drank or eaten was delicious. I would totally recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a hotel to stay in Chicago.
