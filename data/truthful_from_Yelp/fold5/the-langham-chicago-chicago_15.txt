I love a good afternoon tea. The Langham really outdid themselves for their afternoon tea service from excellent service to delicious offerings. The setting for tea is off the charts. While sitting on white couches and chairs, a pianist plays during tea. The table is set with Wedgewood china, holy gorgeous. Our server went through the teas with those of us present, so we could have hot tea sooner than later. I picked a Moroccan mint tea to soothe my stomach after Â a rough bout of not liking much of anything. Once everyone arrived, he went through the menu and asked about allergies. They were extremely accommodating about food issues like my nut allergy and a pregnant friend's restricted diet. For the savory dishes in the afternoon tea, we were each given our own plate with the items ranging from a beef and a tomato nibble, salmon topped toast, and a veggie bite. The Langham has some incredible scones to counter the savory items. Their jams and clotted cream were delicious too. The sweet treats were equally tasty and wonderful. One of the items was a pecan shortbread. Since I couldn't eat it, they offered us a fruit plate. The fruit plate brimmed full of grapes, watermelon, strawberries, etc. So good. For a fancy and delicious afternoon tea, go to the Langham. The view is pretty great too.
