My girlfriend and I stayed at the Westin Chicago River North from September 4th to September 5th. From the moment that we arrived until the moment that we left everyone was extremely friendly, polite, and informative, especially the doorman. Our room was spacious and very clean. The one downfall is the very expensive valet parking cost of $69 per night but the other 2 options are no better. The flat lot a block away is $54 per night and the meters are about $8 an hour. Taxi's are very accessible, so avoid renting a car if you can. There are plenty of restaurants and nightlife locations all within a short walking distance. We will most definitely stay there again.
