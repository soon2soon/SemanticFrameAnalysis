I used Top Fleet's services the first time this past winter. I needed a party bus to take about 20 people from downtown to a bar in schaumburg (round trip) Â for a fundraiser. I booked the reservation only a couple days before the fundraiser. Ryan was super helpful and very professional! The bus was there on time and the driver waited for our group outside of the fundraiser until it was time to take us back downtown. The party bus was incredible! It has satellite TVs and a great sound system. Clean! Overall I couldn't have been happier with my choice with this service. Two thumbs up!
