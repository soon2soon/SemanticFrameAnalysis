Narrated kayak tour of the Chicago river is well conceived and executed. Our party of 4 took the classic Chicago tour on Air & Water show Saturday. Joel, a native sout' sider, delivered a series of accurate and spirited talks at various stops between Goose Island and Trump Tower. Nelson Algren excerpts bookend his interesting riffs on the Pottawatami, crime bosses, robber barons, retail kingpins and the city's battles with nature and pollution. Even if you think you know Chicago you'll probably learn something new. Safety and comfort reminders bordered on the obsessive. There were three additional staffers in kayaks to monitor us at all times. Equipment was in good shape. Two staffers manned the launch area to help us into the kayak, adjust our footrests and transfer us into the river. We got a lot of grins and comments from curious tourists on power craft and along the riverwalk. The rowing is a bit of a workout, so you'll feel like you accomplished something when you're done.
