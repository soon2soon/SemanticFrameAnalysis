Surreal Limo is quality! We used their party bus service for a friends 21'st and let me tell you, Best night i have had in a very VERY long time. The Driver(Tony) was an awesome guy, so laid back and definitely a fun person to talk to! He was very professional and had no complaints from any one in our group. The Bus was very clean and well maintained and rode really smooth. The sound system was booming, the lighting inside was phenomenal, and was very roomy (we had over 13 people and was still very comfortable and roomy.) I highly suggest using Surreal Limo because it was definitely Surreal. I will definitely be using their services in the future! Â Plus they had a stripper pole inside the bus, now who doesn't like stripper poles?!?!
