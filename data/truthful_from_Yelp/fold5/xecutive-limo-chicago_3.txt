I had a great experience with Xecutive Limo when visiting Chicago this winter. The driver was very prompt and extremely friendly and fun. The SUV was very clean, spacious and comfortable. I had to do a bit of a run around with pick ups and drop offs all around the city and they were always there right in time as arranged. Would use them again and again!
