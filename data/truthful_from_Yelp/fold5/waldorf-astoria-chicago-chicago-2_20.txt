I LOVE this place. The Waldorf exudes the ambiance you would expect in New York: super classy, high end, and straight-up marvelous. The drinks are strong, the desserts are small but heavenly. The price is through the roof, but totally worth it, especially if it's a special occasion. I hung out in the small back room upstairs, which is heavily dimmed and contains minimal seating, but once you sit down someone comes to you immediately, asking your order, without any pretentious looks or attitude. Can't wait to come back here!
