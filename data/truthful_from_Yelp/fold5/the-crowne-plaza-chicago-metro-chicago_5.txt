This was a business trip that we added on to, so we were at this hotel for several days.  It is a well maintained hotel with modern decor.  The outside balcony made the room special.  Our friends stayed across the hall. Both rooms had interesting views and it was nice to be able to step outside.  The staff put hospitality into the stay.  Michael Zwolinski, the Front Office Manager, implemented all of our several special requests, kept in touch throughout our stay, and was a great source for restaurant suggestions.  Most important, our room was quiet.  Tiffany, at the front desk was the perfect combination of friendly and efficient when we checked in.  The valets at the front doors, hailed cabs for us, transported luggage, and even patiently took photos for us upon request.  We will happily return during our next trip to Chicago.
