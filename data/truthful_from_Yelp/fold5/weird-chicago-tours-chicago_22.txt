First off, let me just say that our tour guide Jennifer's reputation proceeded her-she was an absolute blast; fun, funny, and an all-around good time.  My girlfriend and I took the tour "Weird and Haunted Chicago" tour on Halloween night (we were tired of the bar scene and we're new in town so we didn't have any parties to go to), and it didn't disappoint.   I booked the tickets with some trepidation; yes, it seemed like fun, but I'm not one for kitsch, and some of the reviews painted the tour like your run-of-the-mill tourist trap (the location of the office, Ontario and Clark, doesn't help any) but I went ahead and booked it anyway.   What we got was an interesting, informative,  and (at times) chilling look at Chicago's sordid past.  Jennifer's delivery of the information was articulate and succinct, and she succeeded in finding a happy medium (no pun intended) in just how much information she divulged.  It reminded me less of a tourist attraction (I'm looking at you, guided Alcatraz tour) and more a great trip to a local mueseum.  We left the tour sufficiently thrilled...and not a little chilled.  All I'll say is that there was somthing that happened during a stop in a certain infamous Chicago alleyway (yes, you get to get off the bus and trapes around these places, snapping pictures at will) that left both my girlfriend and I wondering just how real some of this paranormal activity is...
