We recently hosted a Bachelorette Party for a large group (12 people) of 30-something's in a Junior Suite at The Ivy Hotel & it was perfect!   All attendees commented on how spacious and modern our Suite was.   The hotel staff was more than accommodating and friendly.   The location was perfect, too!   We also enjoyed the Sky Bar - great drinks, views and overall scene for a pre-night out libation.  Only a few of us stayed the night, but of those of us who did, the bed was comfy and the blackout curtains ensured a good nights sleep.  I wish we had booked another night in order for us to have taken full advantage of the bathroom's jacuzzi tub, rain shower, etc.   I live locally in Chicago and I would highly recommend out of town guests stay at The Ivy.   Also recommended for a night away in a hip spot for locals. Only negative - no option for brunch on-site on Sunday, but there are ample locales nearby.
