First time in Chicago. Awesome hotel. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the city. Located right on the "Loop" and just convenient to everything. Â  Stayed in a very nice suite. Very modern with flatscreens tvs in both rooms. View was great. Very spacious and very clean. Fully stocked minibar. Just don't move anything cause you will get charged!! Haha After 9pm the rooftop bar turns into a full blown dance club with a retractable roof. The breakfast brunch was great. I had the beef and cheddar omelet with potatoes. Upon checking out Danielle was great. She removed the charge from the minibar and suggested several restaurants to try and where to do some shopping. Can't wait to come back and hope to stay here again.
