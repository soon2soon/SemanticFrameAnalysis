My girlfriend and I never use a travel agency, my girlfriend always took care of all arrangements on line but I decided to take a chance on Traveloni because somehow I was getting advertisement emails from them so I figured what harm is there in asking a few questions to see what they can offer us for an European vacation,  I am so glad I did.  The first thing they did was get me in conversation with their European specialist, Kathy Allison, to get some ideas, tips and prices.  Kathy blew me away with her knowledge about all of Europe and she helped us decide on a 12 day trip to Barcelona and Paris.  First stop was Barcelona and the hotel she booked us in was beyond perfect, best hotel stay we ever had anywhere and she got us an upgrade at no extra cost.  We spoke with another couple who were paying significantly more then us for a smaller room at the same hotel, so Kathy really took care of us on this.  Kathy put together a few tours and recommended some areas and we enjoyed them all.  Next stop Paris and another upgrade to a suite at no extra cost and the location was perfect for us.  We stayed on the Left Bank near the Latin Quarter and we found some of the most interesting areas to explore .  Kathy booked 4 tours and they were all great, lunch on the Eiffel Tower, cruise on the Seine, hop on hop off bus and a private tour of Versailles .  Kathy included transportation for everything which made getting around easy and stress free.  The best part for me was how Kathy would send me an email every couple days to make sure we were comfortable and having fun, I love this kind of service, it means a lot to me when someone makes that extra step when they don't need to.  I'm sold on Traveloni 100% and I'll use them always!  Bottom line is that they saved us a lot of money, they had the perfect knowledgable person taking care of us and she did a better job then we could have done on our own while saving us money.  Bravo Kathy Allison and Traveloni!
