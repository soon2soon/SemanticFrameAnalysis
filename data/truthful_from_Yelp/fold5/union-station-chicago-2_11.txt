Well, lost my wallet there and never found it - as of yet! - but the sweetest girl in the whole world (worked for Metra, wish I remembered/asked her name) looked around the whole station with me, as did another Amtrak officer. It's a public transportation station, and a place I am in and out of all the time, never gave much thought to the "experience" I have there on an in and out basis, but even after a crappy situation and an up in the air outcome, I just felt like the concern I received from staff was something to write home about :)
