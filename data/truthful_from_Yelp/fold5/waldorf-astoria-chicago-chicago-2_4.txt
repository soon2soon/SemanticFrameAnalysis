I was going to the outskirts of Chicago for a wedding, so I decided to spend a couple of days in Chicago before heading to the suburbs. I'm a Hilton HHonors gold member so I used my points for a two night stay in a standard king room. The room itself was a basic room for the Waldorf but it was nice and roomy for us! The bathroom was huge! We got double sinks, a bathtub and a stand up shower! And the king bed was super comfy! The GM Richard was nice enough to send us a bottle of champagne since we were celebrating a special occasion which was lovely! So the best thing about this place is the attentive customer service! Any time I left or entered the hotel, there would be someone that would help with the door, offer to call me a cab or give me an umbrella if I was going out for a walk. It was raining on and off all 3 days so that was super helpful! There is a gym and pool on the 4th floor. I used a treadmill at the gym once. It's an average sized hotel gym. They have towels and water out for you as well as fruit if you want a snack. My roommate who used the gym every morning said there was also a sauna in the men's locker room. As a gold member, I'm eligible for an upgrade if avail. Unfortunately there weren't any upgrades avail for the days I was staying there, but I got free Voss water which was a nice perk! The only odd thing about our room was that it didn't have an iron and ironing board. (Maybe people who stay at the Waldorf don't iron?) I didn't have a need for an iron, but the roommate needed to iron a dress shirt. So if you need an iron, just call down and they'll bring one up for you. To sum it up, I felt spoiled staying here. All the staff were attentive but not overly so which made for a very pleasant stay. When we got to our hotel in the suburbs with the smaller room and bathroom, we found ourselves missing the Waldorf!
