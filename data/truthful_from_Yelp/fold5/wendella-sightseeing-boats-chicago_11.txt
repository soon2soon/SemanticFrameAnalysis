I've been on a couple of boat tours since moving to Chicago and so far my favorites are the Wendella Architecture River tour and the River/Lake combined tour. Prices are some of the best around for the length of the tours you get. You really have time to relax on the boats and soak in all the sights. The tour guides have always been funny and informative. Parking and getting there can be confusing, so this time I decided to take their advice and just park at Trump Tower. They will give you a chaser ticket that reduces the price to $14 and I think you can park there for 6 hours, so take advantage of a boat tour and then maybe the river walk and dinner before you retrieve your car. Get in line early so you can get the best seats on the boat (I prefer the sides or back of the boat, where they have large benches instead of the chairs.) If you go during the day, be prepared with sunscreen and a hat/sunglasses because it can get quite toasty over 90 minutes, but you can always go down below in the shade.
