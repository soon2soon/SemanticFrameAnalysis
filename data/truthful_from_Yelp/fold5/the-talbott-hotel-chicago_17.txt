From the time we entered the revolving door we felt special. Everything about this hotel is first rate. The staff was friendly and greeted us with a smile and hello each time they saw us. One morning I asked where I could find a news paper. I was directed across the street, and after coming back empty handed, one employee proceeded to find a paper somewhere and then hand delivered it to our room. We've never had "turn down service" and don't really understand it, but the maid came in each night to turn down the bed and leave a chocolate for each of us. The hotel is within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and right around the corner from the Red Line train. Our room had a computer keyboard linked with the flat screen on the wall. We had a Keurig coffee maker. Our home away from home was more than I expected. This hotel has a 4 star feel at a 3 star price.
