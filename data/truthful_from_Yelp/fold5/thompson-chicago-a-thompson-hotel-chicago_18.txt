We had an excellent stay at the Thompson Hotel last weekend. The rooms were great, the service superb, great breakfast at Nico one morning.  But here's the kicker: Larkin, a front-desk employee, saved my dog's life. I won't go into details because it might disturb you.  Frankly it's one of those bizarre freak incidences you used to see at the beginning of 'Six Feet Under'.  But let me just say he saw the peril my dog was in, darted from behind the desk, and in quick-thinking, lightning-quick superhero fashion, literally saved my dog's life.  I am not making this up.   Our dog Bob means the world to us, and therefore Larkin's actions meant the world to us.  We can't thank him enough.   And as said: great hotel.  We'll be back.  Maybe without Bob; we wouldn't want to push our luck.
