Leaving from the Wrigley Building downtown, you're taking in the gorgeous buildings before you even step on the boat. I highly recommend the combined river & lake architecture tour. The opportunity to see the skyline from the lake on a gorgeous Saturday Fall day - what else could a girl in town enjoying the sites want? Not a thing. The tour guide was knowledgeable and we learned about the history of the city, the rivers & lake, and how the skyline came to be. We were blessed with a gorgeous day, so that just made it all the better. No matter where you sat, you had great views and could clearly hear the guide via the PA system. I've been on other tours that was not the case and was happy that this was not the case. If it is your thing, there's a full bar on board too. I would recommend to other visitors in a heartbeat.
