We love The Ritz hotels in general, but this location was perfect for me and my daughters!  Kept us busy shopping while my husband had to attend work events and provided so many dining options once my husband returned for the night!  I filmed a brief tour of our Lake View room if you are interested!  youtu.be/84w5iGe5xzA
