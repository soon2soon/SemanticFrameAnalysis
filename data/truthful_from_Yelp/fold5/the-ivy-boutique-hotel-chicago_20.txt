Stayed here laSt year for the wavefront music festival. . Front desk girl upgraded me to a suite room. . I love the way this hotel looks. . It's very chic and trendy.  The staff are very friendly too, the rooftop bar is a bit small but very relaxing.   I wouldn't recommend the breakfast they serve .. Go around the area and you'll find a lot of breakfast place
