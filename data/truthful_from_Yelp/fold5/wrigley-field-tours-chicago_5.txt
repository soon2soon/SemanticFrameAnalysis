I really enjoyed this tour. Aside from the knowledgeable guide who imparted a boatload of interesting facts, anecdotes and trivia about the ballpark, the tour provided an opportunity to see a lot more of the ballpark than catching a game would have. Great views and photo opportunities. I took the tour on game day, so I missed the opportunity to visit the locker rooms...but the tour was otherwise identical. Wrigley Field turned 100 years old this year. Fenway Park is two years older. The next youngest ballpark (Dodger Stadium) was built in 1962! This tour gives you a chance to step back into history a bit...but not into a museum--into baseball history that is living and breathing, drinking beer and eating hot dogs and partying on the rooftops across the street from the ballpark.
