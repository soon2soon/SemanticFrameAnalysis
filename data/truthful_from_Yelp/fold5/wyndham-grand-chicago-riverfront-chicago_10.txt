For a chain hotel, this definitely doesn't feel like one! They allowed us to check in early, get the top floor (other than the penthouse) on the 38th level with beautiful views of the river and skyline. The staff were really friendly and helpful... Even better?! The room we stayed in was HUGE! Best place to stay for the next 5 days!
