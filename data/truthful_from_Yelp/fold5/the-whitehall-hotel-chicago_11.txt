Absolutely loved our stay. Booked through booking.com, got a good deal for a King room. We checked in at about 3am, and still received very polite service at the front desk. The room was huge for a downtown hotel! I've seen other king rooms that had the bed just take up the whole room, now there was a looot of space here. The bed, pillows and blanket were extremely comfortable. There was a down liner over the mattress that made me feel like I was sleeping on a cloud! I want one at home now :) The bathroom was very spacious, clean, well lit, and stocked with a lot of toiletries, and a ton of towels. The water had good power, and consistent in temperature. The only complaint I would have about the room is that there was just a sheer white curtain covering the windows, there was no heavy dark curtain to hide the lights from the outside/sunrise. Now I am a very heavy sleeper and no sun will wake me up, so I was fine. When we were checking out we asked to leave our bags with the concierge so that we can spend our afternoon in the city, and the front desk was happy to do so. The bags are stored outside with the bellboy, just an fyi. A side note - they do not have free wifi, if that is something you must have, you will need to pay. We did have great service for Tmobile though, so we had no need for wifi.
