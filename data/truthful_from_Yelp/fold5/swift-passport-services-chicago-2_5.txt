Absolutely incredible customer service, and borderline disturbing how fast they operate.  Placed an order for the 8-10 business day passport renewal service and mailed my passport out overnight on a Thursday afternoon.  It arrived in perfect condition that next TUESDAY.   Thank you Laurie and Swift for making my Canada trip possible this year!
