I opted for the Flavors of Chicago tour.  The day of my tour, the temperature was in the single digits with a wind chill of well below zero.  Our guide, Anna Lynn, met us with a smile despite the weather and the fact that there were only two registered for the tour.  We started at Pizano's Pizza (delicious deep dish pizza with an amazing crust) and continued on to six additional locales.  The tastings were as diverse as they were delicious.  Anna Lynn gave us insights into each stop as well as a history of the city.  I have been to Chicago several times, but the other member of our group was a complete newbie from Australia (we both learned a lot).  The great rapport Anna Lynn has formed with each venue was evidenced in how warmly we were received at each stop.   I highly recommend this tour as the perfect way to get to know Chicago while savoring some of its best culinary pleasures.
