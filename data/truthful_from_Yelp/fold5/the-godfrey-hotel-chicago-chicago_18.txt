I went to The I/O Lounge for the first time Tuesday night and was blown away! Â I thought it would be pretentious but was pleasantly surprised. The staff was great and the food/drinks was amazing. The manager even stopped by to make sure we were having a great time. Will definitely be back and will also be sending my friends here!!
