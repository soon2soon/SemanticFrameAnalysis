Love it here! I wish my bed and bathroom at home were this cute. Perfect location for hipsters like us. It was so easy to walk to all the bars and shops we wanted to check out. It is located on a residential one block street between Milwaukee and Division. The staff were all friendly and helpful. They even allowed us to leave our beer purchases at the Inn after we checked out so they wouldn't freeze in the car while we continued to explore for the day. We had a fireplace in our room so we stayed in one night to cozy up and drink/relax. We will use this location any time we visit. Much more fun than staying downtown. My one and only slight issue would be that it is not very soundproof, so don't plan on getting too excited with your significant other. We live together, so weren't too heartbroken about it. Thanks for the great time, Wicker Park Inn!
