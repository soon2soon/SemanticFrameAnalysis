Impressive. I had stayed for several days during a business trip and didn't want to leave. In fact, during one of those days, I didn't leave my room at all (thanks room service!) as it was during the recent "Chi-beria" winter spell. The location is perfect. Walking distance to some of my favorite restaurants in the city. There is also a full gym in the basement. Not a hotel gym. A full gym. Can't wait for my next trip to Chicago to stay at The James again.
