I might have fallen in love with Chicago for a little bit. If it weren't for the horrific winter, I might consider moving to Chicago. Before my visit, my friend told me that I need to take the architecture boat tour and I am so glad I was able to squeeze it in during my 2 day visit. It is a bit pricy at $40+ per person, but it's a very lovely and informative tour. I can't speak for tours hosted by other company, but the ones by the Architecture Foundation is very engaging and informative. The tour was very organized with all the history and different architecture styles. They have various tours available such as photography tour and sunset tour. It's a great way to tour Chicago, I definitely recommend taking the tour and sit on the top deck for the amazing view. Make sure to line up early, so you can snatch a nice seat!
