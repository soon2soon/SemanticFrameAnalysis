The location is great, as long as you have a window, you could be looking at the chicago river, the Wrigley building, Grant Park or Navy Pier. Really good service. I do have to take a half star off for the prices. Even though your downtown, for that price, just stay at the Drake. That and I dislike the selection of resturants around the area. But it gains a star back for the amazing quality of service.
