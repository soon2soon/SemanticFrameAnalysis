I bought a YouSwoop coupon for a double kayak ride for 2 hours and had a great experience. Friendly staff who provided us with a bottle of water and a waterproof sack to put our phone and camera's in and gave us a quick tutorial before we headed out! Definitely recommend doing a personal kayak rental so you can go at your own pace. For Groupon/YouSwoop coupons -- print before you go! Called ahead and asked and they said they will not accept showing an email (Groupon App would be fine I'm sure)
