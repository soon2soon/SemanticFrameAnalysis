My wife and I went to Windy City in hopes of finding a special honeymoon destination. Janet helped us with our selection and we ended up going to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic (Iberostar Grand - All inclusive). The trip far exceeded our expectations as we had a wonderful time of relaxation, eating and drinking in gorgeous weather etc!! The Hotel was immaculate and the service was impeccable!! They provided activities (snorkeling, sailing, volleyball etc.) to keep everyone busy and the food was amazing. If the buffet didn't appeal to us, we could make a reservation at one of their 4 superb restaurants. We couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon!! I highly recommend traveling to this destination as well as the services provided by Janet at Windy City Travel!!
