If you were in Chicago on a business trip and only had 90 minutes to see the city, this is what you'd do. if you landed here from outer space and wanted to learn more about Chicago, this is what you'd do. There is nothing better than the CAF cruise of downtown. Period. For 90 minutes you get a guided tour of some of Chicago's most wonderful buildings as seen from a unique viewpoint. You catch a cooling breeze coming off the lake. You learn a lot more about this crazy town than you thought you ever could. Oh and there's the smell of chocolate in River North. If you're lucky... I've taken this tour 4 times now and every time I go on it, I learn a bunch of new stuff as each docent has their own unique spin on the tour. One docent loved talking about the architects themselves. One loved the decorative styling and one was all about the engineering and how these building were built. And stay up there in the sky. Awesome. Some have commented it's pricey but consider this. The tours are run by the Chicago Architecture Foundation (a not for profit) and the money goes towards educating the public about these landmark buildings. Forget the profiteers - take this tour. There is no other better one. Hands down! A few tips: 1. Buy your tickets online as this sells out quickly. 2. Get there early. Like 30 minutes or more early and get in line. Seating is first come, first served so if you've got a group of 4 or more and want to sit together, you'll want to be first on board. 3. The speakers are located along the railings so if you've got someone who is hard of hearing (like we did) sitting in a "speaker row" is a great idea. Sure it's loud for the rest of us but my father-in-law got to enjoy the tour too which was cool! 4. In the summer - go on one of the earlier tours. The 9:30 tour this past weekend still had room and was cooler than being out on the river at noon!
