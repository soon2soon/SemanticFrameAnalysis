I usually don't write reviews, but these guys were great.  We needed Brazilian visas for our upcoming trip.  The nearest consulate office is 3.5 hours away from our house so I didn't want to have to take the time off of work and pay for the gas to stand in line all day.  I was worried I would have to pay the expedited price with Carnival coming, but they assured me the regular $75 fee would be fine.  They received our passport and paperwork on January 8th and told us to expect it back around January 27th.  We ended up receiving it on January 22nd.  I couldn't be happier I chose swift.  I was worried about the whole process after reading some competitor reviews, but feel I definitely made the right choice.
