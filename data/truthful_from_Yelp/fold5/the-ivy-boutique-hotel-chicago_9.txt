I purchased a deal on groupon for this adorable place and I have to say that I was beyond pleasantly surprised with the location (literally around the corner from the magnificent mile shops) as well as the contemporary decor. The rooms are huge, beautifully decorated, and much more luxurious than I had anticipated for a boutique hotel. Everything was clean and spotless, the staff was pleasant and helpful, and the overall experience was great. I would stay here a million times over. Highly recommend it.
