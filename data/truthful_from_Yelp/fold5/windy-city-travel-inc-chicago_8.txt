My husband and I decided to book our honeymoon to Italy and Germany with Windy City Travels since we did not have time to do it ourselves. Kathy was our super agent, and she handled everything for us. We had our plane tickets, hotels, and sightseeing all booked and all we had to do was show up and enjoy! She was such an expert since she has been to both countries numerous times. The hotels she booked for us were perfect! They were located in the perfect location at every city we went to. The tours she booked for us were also splendid. We especially loved the private 6-person cooking class in Florence. I have never used a travel agent before this trip, but I am definitely going back to Kathy for our next trips. It's free for us and saves us so much time! I highly recommend Windy City Travels and particularly Kathy! She was a pleasure to work with.
