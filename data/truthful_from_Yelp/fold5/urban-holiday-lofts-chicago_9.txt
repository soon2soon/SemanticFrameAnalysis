I decided to stay in a hostel for Thanksgiving instead of a hotel because it cost only a tenth of a hotel room. Otherwise I'm way beyond the hostel/student crowd. However, this is not your typical youth hostel. Yes, I shared a room with 5 strangers, yes, you need to make your own bed, and the mattress is covered in plastic, and you share a bathroom... It's a hostel! But all the people I spoke with at the front desk were really nice and helpful, the bed linens and towel were clean, the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, so was the kitchen including the fridge and microwave... They have an enormous community room upstairs with a TV and books and board games and fantastic views. there was no partying or anything crazy going on. It seemed like everyone minded their own business, and most everyone cleaned up after themselves.
