We stayed at The James for our wedding weekend, and it was lovely. Great location, hip but friendly vibe, nice decor and furnishings, and super accommodating for any one-off needs. (We had a few gift bags that staff handed out to guests as they arrived.) We actually booked rooms at another Chicago hotel but were put off by the boring 80s decorating and conference hotel feel. Surprisingly The James rate for a King Suite was only $10 more and so much more in-line with what we wanted. We had pictures taken in the suites as we got ready, as well as the lobby, and the staff was extremely accommodating. Thanks to The James for being the backdrop to a most wonderful weekend!
