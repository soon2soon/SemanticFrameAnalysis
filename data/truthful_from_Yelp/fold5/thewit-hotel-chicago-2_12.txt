Very nice hotel in a great location. I stayed in a king suite that was very large with a nice soaking tub and nice kitchen. The process to get to your rooms on the elevators (swipe you key to get to your floor) can you some updates because the room keys don't work I many cases. Overall a very nice hotel but it is very expensive
