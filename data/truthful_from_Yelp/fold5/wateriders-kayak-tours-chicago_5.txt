Totally worth the money. I've lived in Chicago for 4 years and learned more in 2 hours on the Chicago Kayak Tour than I did on almost any other tour I've been on. Joel was great. And the staff from start to finish could not have been more friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this tour.
