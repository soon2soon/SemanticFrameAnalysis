Booked through Hotel Tonight. Greeted by the valet who kindly helped us with our luggage  and pointed us to the direction we needed to go for check in. The staff was friendly and professional. Beautiful hotel. The reservation clerk asked us if we're visiting told him of our spontaneous  trip and he booked us in a beautiful corner room with a view of the lake. Will recommend this hotel to anyone.
