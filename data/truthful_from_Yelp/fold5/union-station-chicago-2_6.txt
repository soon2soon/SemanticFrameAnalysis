I don't know why I am being asked to review Union Station. You usually don't have a choice whether you want to use it or not. Here, have my 5 stars, Union Station. Â It gets me to where I want to go. There is a McDonalds there with friendly staff. It is very busy during rush hour. It is near the river which is nice. You can buy popcorn, or donuts, or Jamba Juices, or chinese food, or hot dogs, or Au Bon Pain Avocado+egg on bagel thins, or junk food, or burritos. A lot of things. You can also go on Amtrak from here. I hate taking Amtrak by myself. Sometimes there's one person who looks a bit creepy to me, and then I can't get them out of my head. This is something I need to work through. The station is pretty clean, except for the bathroom. The water fountains have little water pressure. You can take Metra trains to the suburbs here. Outside the schedules show. There are also loudspeakers near each Track that constantly remind you what track it is. This is a nice thing for blind people. The $7 Weekend Pass is great. Don't cheat the system and avoid paying during the weekdays. Metra has a hard time staying profitable :( 5/5 would ride again (not like I have a choice)
