Staying at the Thompson for a week back in early summer was really the cherry on top of my return to the Chi after too much time away.  It's as good as blending business and pleasure as the guys mixing drinks behind the bar in the lobby after 11.   Despite the chic overtones,  the front desk was actually super friendly and also helpful; just be prepared for a good laugh if you ask opinions on the best pizza dive or taqueria.  Two young ladies gave Yelp-quality reviews that ended up leading me to take up a pie from Lou (Malnati's) instead of the default Giordano's or Gino's. A plus suggestion, ladies. Being a foodie before there was a name for that,  having Nico in such close proximity guaranteed at least a few great meals, but honestly everything else is in such close range.  Even close enough for takeout from an über-trendy little sushi spot down the block (Jellyfish). And when you're tired of eating (does that really happen?) there's plenty of shopping to the east along State Street/Michigan/Mag Mile or simply pretty neighborhoods in the opposite direction. The rooms are chic and artsy, following the overall motif (even the usage of the CFL bulbs is... stylish) but comfortable, with views of Lake Michigan if you're good. All in all, I'll book the Thompson at least a few more times in the near future.
