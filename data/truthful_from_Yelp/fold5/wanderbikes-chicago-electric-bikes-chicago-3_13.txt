Stumbled across the electric WanderBikes.  Enjoyed the ride.   Sturdy bikes, neat concept, and great for touring around Chicago and along the lakefront without having to do all the work yourself.  Very friendly and nice owner.  If you're in need of some wheels, give this a shot.  You won't be disappointed.
