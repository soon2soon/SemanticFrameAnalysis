Afternoon Tea at the Peninsula Hotel takes the cake!   Every Christmas season, a group of friends treat ourselves to afternoon tea.  We usually go to The Drake or The Ritz, and both are good.  This year we decided to try a different place, and everyone agreed we've discovered the best... The Lobby in the Peninsula Hotel.   First, it's an elegant room. Wide open, with tables far apart, so you can't hear conversations nearby (a problem especially at The Drake).  The service was beyond excellent.  There was someone at our table every few minutes, refilling out tea pots and water, making certain we wanted for nothing.   They make serving tea a ritual, and a learning experience, too.  You can just order tea, but then you'd be missing the triple tiers of finger sandwiches, cakes and pastries... and scones with lemon curd, jam and whipped cream.   My favorite was the tiny chocolate soufflé. (Writing this review is making me want a sugar fix.)   One of us is gluten free, and her needs were accommodated at no additional cost.  She had to pass up the soufflé, but everything else looked yummy.   Reservations fill up very quickly during the holidays, especially on the weekends.  I made ours just after Thanksgiving, and we got our first choice for seating.
