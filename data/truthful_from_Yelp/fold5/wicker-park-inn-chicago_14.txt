I had a great time exploring the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago and stayed two nights at the Wicker Park Inn during my week long trip.  Reservations book up quickly (this is characteristic of most places in Chicago be it a restaurant, hotel, concert, etc) so definitely book as far in advance as possible. I stayed in the 3-bedroom apartment which is across the street from the main B&B.  It was only me and my infant daughter, plus it was their only room available for the two-night minimum during the week I was there, but they understood this and offered me a reduced rate, which I happily took!   Laura and Robin were very hospitable and a pleasure to do business with.  Upon checking in I was shown the apartment's rooms and features as well as a big binder with all sorts of menus, brochures, and information from local businesses -- ranging from eateries & bars to shops, museums, galleries, and salons.  There's an independent grocery store a few blocks away as well as a Walgreens & 7-11 right around the corner for any food, drink, or convenience items you may need.  The kitchen and bathroom were clean and all the appliances, plumbing etc was in great working order.  Plenty of pots, pans, dishes, etc for cooking meals.  It was really nice to "live like a local" in a fun & hip neighborhood.   The blue line Damen station is just a few blocks up the street and takes you downtown in 15 minutes.  It runs right behind the main building, so being across the street reduced the noise level significantly and for this reason I'd recommend the Bucktown Apartment if you are a light sleeper but want to stay in this area. Overall this place was a fantastic choice - can't beat the price either!  I got a 3-bedroom apartment to myself for less than what the downtown hotels wanted for a crappy "economy" room.  Very pleasant stay and I'm looking forward to returning soon.
