Our group of nine friends (which included a family) had a great time aboard the U.S.S. Windy. The crew is funny, informative, campy and safety conscious. They're always on the lookout for passenger safety but they're also engaging and fun. There are other ways to get out onto the water, but this cruise stands out because of how peaceful and relaxing it can be. And, oh yeah, Red Beard was particularly funny and informative with his mix of Great Lakes history and humor.
