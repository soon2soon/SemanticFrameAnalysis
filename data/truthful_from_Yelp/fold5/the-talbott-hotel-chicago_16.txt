My wife and I stayed her for a long weekend.  SERVICE is what sets this hotel apart.  Everyone is so welcoming and helpful.  Dwayne was wonderful with assistance and suggestions.  The front desk staff was always there to assist.  The hotel is an older hotel, but the rooms are still very nice.  I loved the apple tv and mini mac in the rooms.  You canNOT beat the location.  So close to all the shopping!  Great places to eat so close by.  Easy to walk everywhere.  Not sure if it was our room or the age of the hotel, but the air did not cool the room during the time we slept.  I made sure we had the Eco option off and the A/C was set to lowest setting of 65.  It still was a little stuffy in the room.  We were in room 209.  Also, you do not have a view.  Your window looks at a wall and piping so you do not get much natural light.  I would stay here again.
