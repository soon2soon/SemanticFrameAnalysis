Absolutely love the accommodations. The staff has been very pleasant and courteous, the room has been very quiet. I have enjoyed the historic building and its amenities and decor. Â As a Hilton honors member with frequent stays, I appreciated the room upgrade that was given without asking. Although I could not justify the normal rack Rate on my travel and expense report, the specials that are run from time to time are worth looking into and certainly worth experiencing if you get the chance.
