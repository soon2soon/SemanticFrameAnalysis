If you have no time to do anything else in Chicago to really take in the city, this is what you need to do. The docents (I have no idea where this term comes from) are volunteers who are unbelieably knowledgeable about the history and architecture of Chicago. In fact, even if you know nothing about architecture, you'll come away knowing some really neat things about the city and some of its more eye-catching buildings. Saturday and Sunday mornings they do a "photographer friendly" cruise with a few longer stops for pictures, and the light is perfect in the morning to get some incredible shots.
