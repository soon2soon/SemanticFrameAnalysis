So my wife and I came here to attend the afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday last weekend. We used to both live in London so really do fancy afternoon teas. This was a 6* experience all the way through. The pavilion off to the left of the check in desk is a beautiful modern area with well spaced out tables and chairs. There is a mixture of seating for groups as well as more intimate space. The tea costs $50 which is pretty standard for a high end afternoon tea. Included in that one gets a tasting of two teas, a savory tea service which is followed by a sweet tea service. The service was top notch. They brought us glasses of prosecco for my wife's birthday as well as a cupcake. Â The waitress certainly earned her keep with our meal. They say you are allotted one hour for afternoon tea but we didn't get out of there for over an hour and a half and did not feel rushed at all. After 6 pm, they turn the place into a luxury ice cream parlor which we plan to take our nephews to when they visit for spring break in a couple months.
