The Chicago River Architecture Tour! This was my favorite thing we did in Chicago!! It's $28.50 per person and I would recommend buying tickets online beforehand at wendellaboats.com. You can either print the tickets or pick them up at will call when you arrive. The boat was a lot bigger than I expected. I think we had at least 60 people on the boat with us. There was plenty of seating outside and also inside if you wanna enjoy the cool A/C and grab a drink from the bar. However, outside is better since you can get a better view! This tour was when I fell in love with the city. All the buildings and skyscrapers are absolutely amazing!! Our tour guide was really friendly and knowledgable! Hearing about the history behind all of the skyscrapers and architecture was actually really interesting and fun (am I getting old??). I love how it's a big city with all these tall buildings but the Chicago River runs right through it all. There's truly no other city like it. Highly highly recommend you do this if you're visiting Chicago! :) Also makes for some great photo ops with the river and gorgeous cityscape in the background!
