I wish I would have gotten our tour guides name... She was EXCELLENT!!! We absolutely loved the tour and we had so much fun! I booked this through Groupon for my bridesmaids and myself to have a night out before all of the mad wedding planning was in full force!!! We ended up on the Roaring 20's Pub Crawl! Jackpot!!! We rescheduled a month or so back and none of us realized it was rescheduled for a pub crawl! Mostly my fault for not reading the confirmation email!!! But hey, no complaints here! All of the stories that we were told were excellent! I can not believe all of the horrible reviews this tour got... Absolutely NOT true!!! Â Our guide kept us entertained and was very knowledgable! The bars that we went to were excellent! My favorite being Richard's!!! I will definitely be looking into booking another tour for the bachelorette party!!! And we want our tour guide we had last night!!!!!
