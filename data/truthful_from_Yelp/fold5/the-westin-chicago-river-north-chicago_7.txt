Nice hotel well located with the entrance tucked away on a smaller side street keeping noise and traffic at the main entrance to a relaxing low. The staff was polite and helpful.This hotel understands what customer service means. Excellent Job! The gym inside was great and the rooms looked fresh in style and feel. The lobby restaurant had great service with a good view and tasty food. I ordered from the menu not the breakfast buffet so can't comment other than it was spotless clean and Â did look very good as well. Like all Luxury hotels in big cities it was a bit pricy but overall it was a fantastic place to meet for business and stay while visiting Chicago. I give 4.5 rounding up because of its gym and location to river run/walk trails.
