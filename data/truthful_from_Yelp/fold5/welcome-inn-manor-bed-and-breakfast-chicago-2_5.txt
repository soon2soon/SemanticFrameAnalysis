Words cannot express the likability of this HIDDEN gem in the Southside.  Both hosts, Mell and Angie, were welcoming right from the start.   They are one of the most gracious and thoughtful people we have come across in our lives.  I wanted to celebrate my fiance's birthday at our first bed-and-breakfast experience together.  We were more than pleased with our stay and the hosts' service.  The breakfast on both days were very palatable and scrumptious.  Due to this experience, my fiance and I are more than likely to return to this B&B. We highly recommend this B&B for your stay!!
