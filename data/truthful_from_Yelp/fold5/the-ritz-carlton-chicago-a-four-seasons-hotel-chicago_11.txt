My absolute favorite hotel to stay at. The food is great, the cocktail lounge is incredible, and the service is the best. The last time i stayed here (last weeked) the girl who checked me in was of eastern European decent. Needless to say she was absolutely stunning. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she would do anything to please her man. That little twinkle in her eye turned my review of this trip from a 4 star to a 5 star. I wish i could stop thinking about her but I cant.
