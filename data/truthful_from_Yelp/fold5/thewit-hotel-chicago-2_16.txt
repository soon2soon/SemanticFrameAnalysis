I'm glad I picked this hotel! We had an amazing stay when we were in Chicago on our anniversary. I don't know how to begin of how pleased we are in our stay here. This hotel is conveniently located right next to the State/Lake Train Station . We took the orange train from Midway International Airport to downtown Chicago and got off State/Lake Train Station. We literally just crossed the street and baam, there's our hotel! Warm cookie upon check in! I fell in love with its lobby. Glass walls to visibly see the busy streets of downtown Chicago and if you are a passersby, you couldn't help but notice it's eye-catching chandelier even from the outside. Its all throughout interior is a combination of a contemporary and a classic design, visible in its architectural framework and fine details of its choice of furniture. Our room: we were so lucky to have gotten the corner room (#1102); two sides of the views: the Chicago Theater and the Chicago River (seen in the distant). I picked the "King Spa" room so we had soak tub in our room. The hotel has a spa, you can call them to prep your tub and convert it into a relaxing refuge after your enjoyable tour of the Windy City. Service: anything you request delivers to your room within 3 minutes! There's always someone in front of the hotel to hale cab for you and open doors for you. They are very accommodating if you want to check out late too.
