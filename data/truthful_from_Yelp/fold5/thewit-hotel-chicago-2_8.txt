I like this hotel. It's very clean, in a very good location. If you are from out of town the public transit is down the street. Staffs are super friendly. Valet parking people will greet you, people at the door will greet you nicely. And when you check in they will give you freshly baked cookies! And those cookies are fantastic.. Warm and soft. They gave me some when we checked out too. Everyone is just so friendly and I love it. There is a restaurant/bar on the first floor, meeting rooms on the second and a fitness center on 5th. We stayed on the 19th floor so the view was great. If you like to go clubbing they have a rooftop bar/club. I had fun dancing with some friends. The night I stayed there snowed really hard out but I had a lot of fun just staying in the hotel. There are enough things to do to make it a great night.
