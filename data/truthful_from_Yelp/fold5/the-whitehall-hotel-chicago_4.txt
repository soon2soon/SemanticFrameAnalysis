Got the Fall into Chicago package to celebrate my 1-yr anniversary with my wife. (I included a note in my reservation.) I booked this hotel because it was the cheapest four-star I could find in the area and the package included parking & a couple drinks. Sounded to good to be true, but I thought I'd give it a shot - not too many awful reviews. My wife and I got there late on a Thursday night. I thought I was going to have to haggle to make sure parking was included. We checked in and got to chatting with Daniel who assisted us at the front desk. I asked about the package and he assured me that everything was taken care of. He congratulated us on our anniversary and upgraded our room. All I have to say is WOW! Daniel went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed out stay- room upgrade, drink tickets, great customer service, even a nice note awaiting us when we came back to our room from enjoying our drinks downstairs. Daniel knew that I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and went several extra miles to ensure that our stay was nothing but perfect. Bravo, Daniel, bravo!
