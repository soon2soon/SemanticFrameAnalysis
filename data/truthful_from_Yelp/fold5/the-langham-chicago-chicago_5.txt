This review is solely for the Afternoon Tea at the Pavilion. Although pricey at $50 (before tax & tip), it's definitely worth it to treat yourself every once in awhile. There's a variety of tea selections, from traditional to more creative flavors. The savory plate was served first, then the sweet plate including 2 scones per person -- our favorite were definitely the scones, which paired well with the homemade jam & clotted cream on the table! Also, my friend who lived in Paris for 6 months said that their honey (of which they gave one small jar per person) was her favorite (authentic) brand from France. Lastly, I couldn't finish my last 2 small cakes so I had them wrapped up to go -- when I got home, I pleasantly discovered that they had given me 3 extra desserts (that I had already sampled/eaten!) So thoughtful and generous of them. Overall, all the food, service, and romantic ambience made the experience well worth the price - I highly recommend The Langham for tea!
