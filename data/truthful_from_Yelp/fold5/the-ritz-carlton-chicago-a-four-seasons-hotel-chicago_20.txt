Where do I start?  How about the pinnacle of service, management, problem resolution, personability, location and organization:  The Ritz Carlton - A Four Seasons Hotel.  My newly married wife and I could not be happier with the entire process of planning our reception with the property.  From day 200 to day 1 of wedding preparations was seamlessly coordinated with the invaluable help of the Catering Department.  Spearheaded by the lovely yet strikingly focused, Amanda Belton, we felt comfortable in the safest hands in Chicago. With the forethought of a grandmaster chess player and the eloquence of a poet, Amanda is the whole package.  We happily dealt primarily with Amanda however there we a few other individuals in the Catering Department that absolutely deserve recognition.  Mackenzie Patsey like clockwork kept us informed every step of the way with room bookings and other miscellaneous questions.  While she might not have been part of every conversation she was thoroughly aware of the ins and outs of our specific needs and able to answer questions at any time.  Francis was another outstanding part of the team.  While unfortunately we did not get to see him in action until the day of the wedding Francis, like his counterparts, were dialed in every step of the way.  With the entire team, the second I thought of something I possibly needed it was being handed to me at that moment.  I have digressed a bit with gushing about the staff but its hard not to.  The location is unbeatable with the amazing fountain in the main lobby, the elegant facilities, spectacular view from the ballroom and the monstrous crystal-dripping chandelier.  My bias might be showing slightly because it was our wedding but the food was quite possibly the best wedding food I have ever tasted.  I would implore anyone looking for the perfect wedding to read this article (yahoo.com/health/who-kne…) and book the Ritz Carlton-A Four Season Hotel ASAP.
