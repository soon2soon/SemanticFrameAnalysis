Beautiful old dame of a hotel right downtown, a block off Michigan.  We got upgraded to a suite for no apparent reason (staff liked us, maybe cuz we were traveling with mom and got her a private room also?  IDK).  Depending on the deal you grab, the pricing will be moderate to somewhat pricey.  Good deals abound though, see below. The only downside of the Allerton is the lobby desk/checkin/concierge area gets very crowded in mornings (it's right next to the elevators), and the staff is overwhelmed by the crush of needy guests between 8AM & 10AM, so be forewarned.  Minor complaint though, and the nuisance is very temporary as you make your way through the daily crowd. Beautiful, classy, and classic hotel rooms, great linens, updated flat screens, proximity to the heart of downtown, and a swank, eclectic bar are enough to bring us back soon.  There are specials for the Allerton that run on Groupon at least once a year for the summertime months.  Grab one and head on up to all the coolness of Chicago.  Highly recommend this hotel for value and high "cool factor".
