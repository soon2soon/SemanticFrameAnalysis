AMAZING hotel. Gorgeous, contemporary vibe with lots of sparkle. My mom was obsessed with the pillows and comforter, and the rooms were super spacious. We stayed as part of a wedding weekend and the hotel staff could not have been more accommodating. Every request from sending up champagne glasses to toothbrushes to extra towels was met with a smile. The Bell Staff was particularly friendly and I have to shout out to Johnnie and Enrique for superb service - we even hugged them goodbye! Two especially stand out moments occurred on wedding day. We weren't having the Bride's room serviced since we were taking pictures/getting ready in there and they staff brought up extra towels and make up remover wipes anyway in case she would need it later. Also, when everyone was at the wedding venue we realized we forgot a special handkerchief, a boutonniere and a corsage - the hotel manager found them for us and personally drove them to the wedding venue to ensure they made it in time. OUTstanding. Would definitely stay here again- near two subway stops (blue line is 2 blocks away and will take you to Ohare), two blocks from Millenium Park, a Pizanos is right on the corner as is a Garrett's popcorn. Awesome location.
