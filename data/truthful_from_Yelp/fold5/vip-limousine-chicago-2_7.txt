Anna takes the calls and is top notch with her service! Mark has been our driver all three times we have used VIP and could not be better at what he does! We live in the suburbs and went to a show at the Aragon; showed up early and got us to the event before anyone expected. Next my brother used them for an airport run, again with nothing but praise and lastly I got married last week.  Mark was on time, a complete gentleman and from now on VIP is my go to limo company.  Rates are fair and I recommend this company to family and friends now
