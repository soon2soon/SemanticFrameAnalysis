Our business used Top Fleet services to pick up our out of town guest from ORD and drop them off at a hotel in the south loop.   I had spoken with Ryan and asked to have our guest communicate directly with the driver.  Our guest where happy to have the ability to speak with their driver once they landed and they informed me that they arrived at their destination without any delays.   The next morning I called the driver to assure a timely arrival and he arrived at the hotel to pick up our guest on time.  The same driver dropped our guest at our office at the Civic Opera building and waited out front to take our guest to various locations within the city of Chicago.  The driver was dressed professional, curious, and prompt.  The vehicle was clean and stocked with cold water.  We where happy with the service and pricing, I have also used this service for personal use departing and arriving from ORD.  Departing the driver arrived as scheduled.   For the pick -up our flight came in early and the driver ran a little late as expected when traveling on our expressways.   I was happy to sit with my family and enjoy the ride home in a comfortable clean limo.   Tomorrow I have contracted Top- Fleet to take my Aunt and her caretaker to the dentist in the south Loop and back.   Top Fleet is a good alternative sometimes it is best to let the professional's drivers battle the rush hour traffic.  I would highly recommend Top Fleet.
