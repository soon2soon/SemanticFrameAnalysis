Alright everyone....no doubt this is one of THE places to stay in Chicago. We stayed here last February and had an incredible suite. Huge soaking tub, separate shower, living room, fireplace, bedroom, a second bathroom, balcony....nothing less than perfect. The staff was first class....even though they won't let you tip them. We had to leave a day and a half early due to a snowpocalypse that was coming, and they gave us NO trouble at all and even helped us to arrange for a car back to the airport. The perks were definitely something to write home about. The spa....oh, the glorious spa. Hot stone massage with volcanic shells? Ok, twist my arm. An orchid to stare at while you are having said back massage....nice touch! The best pedicure of my life. I would go to the spa everyday if I could. All in all, right up there, if not better, than some of the four seasons I've stayed in.
