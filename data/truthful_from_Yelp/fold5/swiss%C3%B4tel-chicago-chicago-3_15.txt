What a relaxing stay!! I needed a hotel located in downtown Chicago for business meetings and a quiet place to relax in between. My travel agent booked this hotel and I'm so glad that he did! The ease of my stay was indescribable. From the staff helping me catch a cab to my nearby meetings to walking alongside the scenic snow covered river close by then grabbing a tasty meal at the Palm restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. The decor is exquisite. The room was kept clean and room service was on point. Everyone was friendly and, even after only three hours of sleep, one staffer confessed. I felt at home here. On my next stay in the downtown area I will be back at the Swisshotel with a bathing suit next time - the pool looked like fun!
