I recently read that Virgin America got voted one of the best airlines in the whole world. I would definitely have to agree. None of my other airline experiences have held a candle to Virgin. My previous fave airline was Southwest, but given the choice, I'd pick Virgin over Southwest. Why you say? Flying isn't that much fun. Obviously, getting to the destination is fun, but I get bored fast, so anything that requires me to sit still for a few hours drives me quite mad. But Virgin will keep you entertained! I was watching reality TV for my 4 hour flight to LA. It was fricking incredible and like nothing I've ever experienced before. I honestly wish that there was a direct flight from Chicago to Vegas cause Virgin would be my flight of choice! (Please, please get on that!) They also have amazing customer service. Everyone seemed to love their job--not sure if that's the case or if they just faked it well, but we got a warm fuzzy feeling the whole time. It was fantastic! Our flight was ridiculously cheap because we had a Groupon. Sadly, I haven't seen any kind of voucher since, but I always keep my eyes peeled. I heart you, Virgin America!
