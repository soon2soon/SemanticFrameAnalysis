Amazing staff, amazing shower, cookies once a day, muffins in the morning, great room size. No problems with cleanliness. They went through great efforts to straighten up and provide fresh towels. They helped with everything!  We never had one issue and staff made sure we were accommodated. Thank you ivy!  We will be back.
