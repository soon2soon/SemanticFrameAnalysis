We arranged a tour for a group of 10 and had a great time. The electric bike concept is becoming very popular in Europe and other major cities in the U.S. - you are still pedaling, but it offers different levels of pedal assistance allowing you to go faster and farther for the same amount of effort (just like the motorized walkways in an airport). Hills are no longer intimidating or exhausting. They are great for people of different fitness levels and ages and enable everyone to travel at the same speed using an effort level with which they are comfortable. Wanderbikes uses the Stromer Â bike produced by a Swiss company, and they are considered one of the very best bikes on the market -very smooth and responsive. The lakefront tour was beautiful and we stopped at points of interest along the way. Brady was our tour guide, and he first explained how the bikes worked and allowed us to practice before starting off. Basically, all you really need to be able to do is ride a bike. Even those of us who had lived in Chicago for years learned information about points of interest that we didn't know before. I would highly recommend doing the tour for Chicagoans and especially for tourists visiting Chicago - it's a fun way to explore and see the our beautiful lakefront. Wanderbikes also offers bike rentals if you want to explore the city on your own.
