We did the Fireworks Paddle tour and I thought it was worthwhile.  Reservations were pretty simple to make and they were flexible.  Prices were definitely competitive.   The fireworks tour was a three mile paddle from Chicago Ave down to Navy Pier and back.  We were with a fairly large group so they had more than one guide.  I will agree with other reviewers in that I was a little concerned that they could provide more information on correct paddling technique and safety than they did.  I felt comfortable only because I had kayaked in the past.   When doing this tour be prepared to get wet.  Not little bit of water but like soaking wet.  The Chicago River is not pretty either and there are some parts of the tour where I would recommend just drifting instead of padding to make sure that you don't bring in nasty debris into your kayak. The staff was friendly, helpful, and reassuring throughout the trip and I did feel like I was in good hands.  Definitely a great experience.
