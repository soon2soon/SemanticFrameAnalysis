Honestly, this was the perfect round trip flight experience to San Francisco and back home to Chicago. I'm absolutely hooked on flying Virgin! Flight to San Francisco: On time, perfectly comfortable, excellent service, and super amazing smooth landing (didn't even feel us touch the ground). Cheese and cracker meal was delicious, and always someone around when needed. Flight home from San Francisco: On time, perfectly comfortable, excellent service, arrived 30 minutes early! Overall, I don't travel often, but I honestly can't imagine flying any other airline if given a choice. For all my other travel excursions I remember feeling cramped and uncomfortable. If I had one thing...wait two things to say about why one should consider flying Virgin, it's for the comfort and service. Thank you Virgin! You completely rock my travel world each and every time!
