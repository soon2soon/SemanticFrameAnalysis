Really enjoyed my stay here. I ended up ordering a burger from the restaurant downstairs and my friend and I agreed it was one of the better burgers and definitely the best fries we've had. The beds were super comfy, huge mini fridge drink selection and lots of fun snacks (at an extra co$$$t of course.) The hotel is surrounded by some great little restaurants and right across the street from TJ's! The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I requested some extra pillows and they promptly brought me pillows galore, it was epic. This will definitely be my first choice for my next visit to ChiTown. (Don't miss my pic of the amazing view from the room!)
