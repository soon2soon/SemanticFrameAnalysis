WHAT A GEM!! I will never stay anywhere else in Chicago! Front desk was extremely friendly and welcoming- they let me check in early no problem. The room (king size) is huge and wonderful. Price was extremely reasonable when I booked through kayak. It might be because the restaurant is under renovation. They have complementary breakfast too. I could not be happier!!
