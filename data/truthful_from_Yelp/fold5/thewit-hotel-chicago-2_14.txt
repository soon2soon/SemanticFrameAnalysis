We hosted our wedding for 100 guests 2 weeks ago at the Wit Hotel. The Director of Catering, Jenna, was absolutely awesome to work with. From our very first email exchanges, Jenna was very honest about the process, the number of guests that would fit comfortably in the space we chose, and the pricing for everything. She was always available by phone or email with any questions that we had, or just to review things that we had previously discussed at the beginning when we signed our contract. She was always very organized given the amount of emailing we did. She was even present at our tasting. She is the best! The hotel was great for hosting the reception, too, as all of our family were flying in from out of town. The amount of space on the roof during cocktail hour was perfect, and the dinner at Cibo Matto was exceptional. The team went out of their way to make sure we were comfy in our suites, too. It was very easy for guests to take the el to the hotel from O'Hare and cabs were very easy to come by. We were very happy with the ease of communication across the entire team at the Wit, and can't wait to come back for drinks at Roof!!
