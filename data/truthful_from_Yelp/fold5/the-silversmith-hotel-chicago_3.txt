If you need a relatively inexpensive hotel but still need that certain level of quality, you really can't go wrong with the Silversmith. Great location, wonderfully friendly staff, and the rooms are so lovely. The staff will accommodate you with all your needs - our room didn't have a fridge and the front desk went to the storage to see if they had any extras. They didn't, but I really appreciated her looking! 5 Stars well earned!
