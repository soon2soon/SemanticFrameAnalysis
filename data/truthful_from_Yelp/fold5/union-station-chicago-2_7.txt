Absolutely stunning every time I visit it. The Great Hall is a must see for visitors. The fact that there are several bars and restaurants makes it a great transit hub though it doesn't offer much selection. Is a great experience for those visiting the city or looking to spend some time warming up before trekking around the city. I could not speak for the punctuality of trains and such but overall train trips have been positive though I'm not a commuter. The experiences I've had with the staff have been overwhelmingly positive. When my grandmother and disabled uncle came to visit they let us borrow a wheel for several hours of the day for exploration around the city. That's not something I would expect but greatly appreciated. That kind of service makes Union Station 5 Star worthy.
