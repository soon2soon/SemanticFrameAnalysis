We went to Chicago last year and again this year and went on a Wendella boat cruise both times.  Last year we took the architectural cruise and this year the sunset cruise.  We enjoyed the history and education about the different buildings on the architectural tour.  It gets dark while you are on the cruise and you get to see the lights on the buildings along the river. But I have to say the sunset cruise was just really breathtaking.  It is a nice romantic cruise out through the lock onto the lake and then to the North then back south of the river.  The views are just amazing and the cruise lasts about 2 hours.  We took a lot of pictures and just loved it.  They do talk about Chicago's history and the buildings visible from the lake.  There is a cash bar, the bathrooms are clean and the boat overall is very nice.  The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  I would suggest sitting on the upper deck if you can.  Get there a tad early during peak season to make sure.  And bring a light jacket because you will be out on the water.  I would definitely recommend this tour for adults.  Children might not have the patience for the sunset cruise though.
