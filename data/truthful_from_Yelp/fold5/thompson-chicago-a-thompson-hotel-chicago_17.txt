On a quick weekend get away for my wife and I, we decided to stay at the Thompson because of the reviews posted. This was a pre-valentines day celebration really in protest of the actual holiday. But I highly recommend staying at The Thompson. I was a little thrown off because we didn't get free cookies and milk, but I'm not 4 and and still on my New Years resolution, so it is all good! Besides, we were treated to coffee and tea every morning. Certainly spring for the corner king room. Beautiful views of Chicago and that extra little space and depth was awesome! The bed was very comfortable and the Res products in the bathroom are very very good! I am a gym rat and loved the set up of the gym on the 4th floor! Equipped with great equipment (including a TRX), there is free water and apples there. The staff was certainly the gem of this hotel! We were warmly greeted every time and we loved our conversations with Lawrence on our complimentary drives (in an exquisite Audi A8L). Calls to house keeping for nick nacks were promptly responded to. The only negative was that we did not take advantage of Nico, the restaurant! I won't make that mistake next time. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
