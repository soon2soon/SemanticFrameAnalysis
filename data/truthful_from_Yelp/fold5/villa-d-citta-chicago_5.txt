Fabulous place to bring someone special! Stayed in the Tuscan suite, made me want to redecorate my own home! Great location, quiet neighborhood, walking distance to anything, and a nice view from 3rd floor rooftop. What makes this place really special is Kathy and her staff!! They are extremely nice and helpful, makes one feel very special. Before we stayed for our visit,I felt the prices were a little on the "too much" side of things. The day we left, I felt it had been worth every penny!! I would stay here again and again!!
