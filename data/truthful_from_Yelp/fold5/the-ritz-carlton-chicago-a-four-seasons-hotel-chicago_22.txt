Stayed here during a night off from work and had a great experience. The staff are beyond friendly and the beds are like sleeping on a cloud. I've stayed on the river by in the Westin for a similar price and the Ritz is a far better experience. Everything from the nightly bed turn-down service to the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The location is also great! Great shopping is in the same building, Lake Michigan is only steps away, and almost as soon as you walk out, you're on Michigan Blvd. If you plan to do shopping, beware of the 9%+ Chicago sales tax. The wall-to-wall windows give great views of the city or the lake. If you bring a car, valet parking is, I think, $57 a night. But if you drive out the valet parking drive way and turn left, you can park overnight in the water tower garage for $37 a night. The wifi is free...kind of. There's the free version that's spotty, slow, and unreliable. Or you can pay more for the premium wifi which will support streaming.
