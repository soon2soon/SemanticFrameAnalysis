To whom it should concern: I just wanted to bring attention to the great service my college and I have consistently received from Piers at the 4th floor rooftop bar.  He not only makes amazing cocktails and is on point with every detail, but also over the past several months- across multiple stays...  He is always greeted is by name and  has been an amazing Ambassador to the Godfrey.
