All I can say is wow! Our stay was spectacular! We had great service, ambiance was so relaxing, and great place to stay! We stayed 4 days and 3 nights. On our last 2 nights we ate downstairs at their restaurant. The drinks were pricey and so were some if the meals but they were great! My mom ordered the lemon head martini. She thought she would try something new so she tried it! She finished it but barely. We figured out the next day it had 4 shots of vodka and very strong and dry. We wouldn't order that again. But on the flip side on our last night we went to the front desk and asked how long it takes to get to the airport and when we should leave. We ended up going to the airport in a black suburban! Haha what an outcome and they hooked us up the right way!;) we were very impressed and would recommend staying here!
