Wow.. can't say enough positive about this place! Hmm, amazing breakfast choices in the morning, with all sorts of high quality protein and milk. My "Chicago" room was spotless as can be. Bathrooms were clean as well. Robin the front desk gal was so, so nice. She helped me out a few times when I couldn't open the damn door! Will stay here again!
