We went in this tour and had booked it that morning via their website. Looked like the tour was sold out so glad that we booked in advance. This was the highlight of our trip to Chicago. Our guides were Shoulders and Knuckles. They were of the older generation and had lots of stories to tell about chicago around the whole prohibition era. They were absolutely brilliant and really entertaining as well as funny. The sites we visited were really interesting and would encourage you to read up on the what happened at the time. I would highly recommend this tour.
