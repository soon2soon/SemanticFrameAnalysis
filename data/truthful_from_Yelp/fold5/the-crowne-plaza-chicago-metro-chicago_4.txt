First and definitely won't be my last. I stayed here alone on this trip and a trip well stayed. They had a bar/ restaurant and a gym that was pretty legit, open 24 hours I might add. The rooms were clean and I had a housekeeper who was very gitty and attentive. The beds were comfortable and the space was reasonable. Oh, I also had a cool little balcony that I made a point to enjoy every once in a while. This hotel was conveniently located around lots of different things; Walgreens across the street, a met market, a few bars and restaurants and everything definitely a short distance in a walking commute. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. They provided taxi service and valet as well.
