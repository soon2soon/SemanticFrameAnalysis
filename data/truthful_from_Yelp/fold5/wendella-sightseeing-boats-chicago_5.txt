Wendella Sightseeing Boats is well worth the money! You get beautiful views of the city, and the boat stops long enough at the really pretty scenes. It's very informative and fun (our guy was really funny). Get there early for good seats! Also, make sure you ask employees where the boat actually is so you don't waste time hunting for it. Even though there's a banner that said "WENDELLA" and a banner that said "SOME OTHER BOAT COMPANY" (I can't remember what it was), the boats had switched docking positions... we almost tried to get on the wrong boat!
