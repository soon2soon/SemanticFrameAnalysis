I'm giving this 5 stars because I had a lot of requests and Top Fleet delivered on all of them as well as going above and beyond. Ryan (owner) was quick to respond to my online inquiry and picking out a car and his recommendation the whole process was easy and painless. I hired Top Fleet for a whole day, about 6 or 7 hours on a Saturday to take me and my guests, 7 of us, around Chicago as we were visiting several different wedding dress boutiques. Bruce was our driver, he called ~30min before the scheduled arrival to let me know his current location and ETA. He arrived early and was waiting for us, it was perfect timing. He was super sweet, very thoughtful about everything and was extremely well prepared. I had shared the itinerary with Ryan a few days before, which was 4 different stops and 5 total pick ups at different locations around downtown. Bruce had the itinerary and knew it front and back, had it printed out and confirmed each stop with me every step of the way. (which helped ease my nerves and anxiety of the day in general, so great to be able to not have to worry about the organization of it all, Bruce took care of everything). He even had beer & water stocked in the car, which was fantastic and just the entire experience it really felt like Top Fleet set out to delight the customer and in the industry I work in, that is everything. Bruce was also flexible, and had a lot of fun with our group. There was one point when we had arrived ~40min early to the next appointment and he offered to simply drive us around, give a little tour of Chicago. Due to the hungry hippo nature of our group we responded with "Can you just drive around until we see a cupcake place" He laughed and of course took us to and from a cupcake place before the next appointment. It was raining as well and he walked each one of us, one at a time from the car to the store under his umbrella (since no one had brought one). I highly recommend Top Fleet!
