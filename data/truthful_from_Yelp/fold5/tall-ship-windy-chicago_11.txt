By far my favorite boat to bring people on when visiting the city. I have been on this boat about 2-3x a year for the past couple years & I enjoy it every time. Yes, I know all the stories by now but it is still fun. I've taken my siblings on the boat, grandparents, friends & even two dates ;) The setting is perfect for any occasion. You can listen to the stories or go cuddle up under the blankets they provide at the top of the boat. The boat has a cute little bar also. Every staff member I have ever met is super friendly & always smiling. I can't wait to go on the boat again this year.
