I have been there so many times and you cannot go wrong with the Ritz. Great location , beautiful building. All rooms have wonderful views and they are very spacious. I had dinner and breakfast there. Dinner was excellent: scallops with sweat potatoes pure, lobster with some veggies. Breakfast: omelet, fruit smoothie and mimosa I was very happy with all staff. They are well trained to make their guests feel comfortable and welcomed. Prices-$$$$ but money well spent For sure, I will be coming back .
