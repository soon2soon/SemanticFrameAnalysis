I stayed here with my husband last weekend and we stayed in the Provence Room. Robin greeted us when we arrived. She was super friendly and gave us lots of great info about restaurants, things to do in the area, and how to get there via public transportation. This B&B is in a great location off of Milwaukee Ave, with a diverse assortment of restaurants, unique clothing stores, record stores, bars, and coffee shops.   The Wicker Park Inn was cozy and inviting. The sheets and the room in general was very very clean. The bathroom (ours was a private one in the hall) was also very very clean and comfortable.  We felt like home having the kitchen/dining room area right outside our room and always stocked with delicious snacks and drinks.  Breakfast was great with croissants, fresh fruit, yogurts, bagels, and more. We really felt at home here and will come back, possibly this summer.
