We stayed overnight with our baby during the Christmas holidays. Everything was great starting from their reception, they even gave our baby girl a plush toy which she loved. The pool was nice and clean, warm room and good views too. Our room was big, the bed was comfy, and we had a cute kitchenette. Bathroom was beautiful and clean too. One thing though they didnt have much of a restaurant since they only had a 10 course meal type which we weren't really into. But what amazes me is that we left my husband left his signature loafers they still kept it for almost a month! I dont think ive ever had a hotel return lost items for that long. Thabk you!
