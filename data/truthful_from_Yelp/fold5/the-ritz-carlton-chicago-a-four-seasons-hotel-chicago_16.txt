Very comfortable room.  Well appointed.  Every staff member I encountered was extremely nice and accommodating.  Super-easy access to the mall next door and to Michigan Ave.  I left a few things in the room and security had them promptly sent back to me, no issues whatsoever.  I would definitely stay here again.
