I have worked with Kathy over the past two years to coordinate late summer European vacations, and she has been nothing short of excellent. She really listens to my criteria for what I'm looking for regarding budget, types of hotels, and structure of our itinerary. She is very resourceful at choosing exciting tours and activities for us to participate in during our vacation. She is also very prompt about making necessary arrangements and loses no time. Additionally, she is very thoughtful about little details. For instance, we took a train to Belgium from Amsterdam, and Kathy not only booked our tickets, but she also printed them off for us so that we would have them in hand and not have to worry about it. When I work with Kathy and this travel agency, I never feel that I have to stress about anything. I will continue to go to her anytime we wish to plan a vacation.
