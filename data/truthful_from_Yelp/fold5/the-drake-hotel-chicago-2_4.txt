I love the Drake.  The people that work here are clearly committed to a career in hospitality and that is the big difference in a hotel experience.  You can stratify hotels by price but within those price points what really defines the quality of the experience within similar price points is the staff.  Everyone at the Drake seems passionate about their job and ensuring that their guests have an exceptional experience.
