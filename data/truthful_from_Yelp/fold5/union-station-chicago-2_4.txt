I do love this station. You can easily find your way throughout it. There is a food court upstairs. There is plenty of seating while you wait. Get there early to be sure not to miss your train. They are right on time unless there are issues.   Most of the Amtrak personnel are friendly and helpful. One exception was a woman who came to tell us to move out of an aisle. Then she told another train line to do the same. She was rude. Yelling and corralling us like sheep. I think she could have gotten her point across without her demeaning attitude. Whatever! The rest of them are nice. The train ride itself is always positive. Restrooms can get stinky, but I guess that's to be expected. There are 2 restrooms on each car.  Seats recline and are comfortable. Trays drop down. You can take your own food on or buy on the dining car. Electrical outlets at every seat section. Onboard free wifi. Check online about carry-on. They allow quite a bit actually. So you may not even need to store anything below. I never have any of the times I rode. You can't beat the price and you can sit back and relax while someone else takes you to your destination.
