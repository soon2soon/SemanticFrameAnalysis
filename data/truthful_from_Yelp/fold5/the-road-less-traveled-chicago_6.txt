Our daughter's trip to Costa Rica with RLT exceeded her (and our) already high expectations.  The experience began well before the actual trip and extended beyond, with thoughtful, meaningful outreach before and after the trip.  The trip itself was a purposeful, service and education oriented experience geared towards personal growth...with plenty of fun along the way.   The skilled instructors did a terrific job at bringing the group together, leading and encouraging thoughtful discussion, and generally enhancing the experience.  RLT it seemed clear to us is a highly experienced organization with high standards marked by a carefully considered ethos and a well-executed program.
