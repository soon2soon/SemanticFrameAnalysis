This was an outstanding tour.  You see many things, and hear many, many very detailed stories.  Some report the humor is corny, but I enjoyed the laughs,  the songs, the puns, and the entertainment.   Lots of energy and entertainment.   "Three Knifes" is probably the best guide you can have.  Don't miss this tour.  you will have fun and learn a ton!  All the locals know it's a smart move to take the tour.
