We stayed at theWit on our wedding night. What a great hotel! Our room was very cool, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city. The bathroom was nice and spacious, and the room was well designed to be functional and comfortable with limited space. In the morning we ordered room service breakfast. The food was exceptional for room service. They had organic tea and dressed up the eggs and potatoes with cilantro and onions, which we thought was a nice touch. Overall, a good value for the atmosphere and amenities.
