Love this hotel! This was my second time staying here in Chicago. The first time we came for a Groupon deal, and the second time was just because I had such a great first stay! Even without the Groupon the hotel is very reasonable for downtown Chicago luxury. The location is excellent, right in walking distance to Millennium Park, shopping, restaurants, bars, and the art museum. Everything else is just a quick train or bus ride away, which conveniently pick up very close to the hotel! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We arrived super early in the morning from the Megabus and even though we came prepared to kill some time until we could check in, they had a room ready and let us get in even earlier than I had hoped so we could rest a little bit before starting our day out in the city! Art was the front desk guy and made the start of our trip so great! The rooms are very elegant, clean, and spacious. The beds are super comfortable and for in the morning there is a Keurig with complementary coffee so you can get that first cup in even before leaving the hotel. After we checked out, we were going to be leaving in the evening so they were able to watch our bags all day while we enjoyed the rest of our day exploring the city. Definitely will stay again, thanks so much!
