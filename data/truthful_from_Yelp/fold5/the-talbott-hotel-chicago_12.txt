Outstanding Chicago hotel near North Michigan Avenue. Lovely hotel... Everything about it was fabulous. Absolutely no complaints. Spacious room (larger than some Chicago apartments!) with all the amenities. Absolutely beautiful. Wonderful staff and service. An interesting touch was that the desk worker asked to see out room key before we went up to our room (late at night/early Morning on New Year's Eve). Nice extra security feature. The restaurant, Bice, that was attached closed after the kitchen staff walked out. It's still a functional restaurant but not the same. Iooooved Bice. Awesome Italian food. Sad that it's closed.
