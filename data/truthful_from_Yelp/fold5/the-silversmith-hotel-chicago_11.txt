The whole interior is full of sparkle motion! It's very silver and modern with twinkly lights and clear gems and mirrors all over the place. Our room was plush and updated with a very comfy bed and beautiful decor. Even though we were right near the train, we slept well and weren't too disturbed. We enjoyed some drinks at the bar and the bartender really put a lot of love into a blackberry cocktail that my man ordered. If I ever find myself in Chicago again, you bet your ass this will be the place I'll stay!
