Had a great time at the Godfrey.  Very nice hotel in a good area of Chicago.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The décor was contemporary but comfortable.  The fitness room was basic, nothing great, but not bad.  Only thing that was a downer was the parking - $43 for an overnight stay.  However, it was very convenient.
