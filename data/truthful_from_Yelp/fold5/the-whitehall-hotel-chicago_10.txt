Rhonda, the concierge  who has nothing to do with accounts payable, helped me to get a phone number for a live person in Whitehall's corporate office in which to address my company's overdue invoice.   "They" said a check would be cut today.  Thank you, Rhonda.  You have lovely phone manners and efficient follow-through.
