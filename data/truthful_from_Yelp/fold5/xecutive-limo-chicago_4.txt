Big thanks to Xecutive Limo for being part of an engagement surprise that I planned for my (now) fiancé. I had been planning this for weeks which included dinner, a walk to the first place we kissed and a limo ride to the bar we first met at (McGees) where she was surprised with friends and family from out of town. I was stuck in a tough spot as I couldn't lock down a horse and carriage as easily as I had hoped. I called Xecutive the DAY BEFORE this was all supposed to go down. Xavier was incredibly helpful with my unique request. I needed a limo to wait on a corner until we arrived (had to have it there early just in case), drive us to two different spots and then drop us off at the bar but pretend to wait for a few minutes to convince my fiancé that this was just a quick stop and we were going other places. We only actually sat in the limo for about 45 minutes and Xavier provided a very fair price. Our driver George knocked it out of the park and the night was about as perfect as I could have hoped. Big time recommendation for Xecutive and I'll be using them again in the future. Note: Should also mention the limo was very clean, nice and had a surprisingly awesome music playlist going on.
