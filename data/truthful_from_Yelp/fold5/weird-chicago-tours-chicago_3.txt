This past Halloween weekend, a friend and I decided to take the "Blood, Guns, and Valentines Crime Tour" with Weird Chicago and it was a fun and unique way to spend the afternoon! The guide really knew his stuff! He had a half spooky, half humorous way of telling the information, which made the tour more of a "light"experience despite the heavy subject matter. Without giving too much away, the tour took three hours, and discussed sights in the South Loop, the Loop, Gold Coast, and Lincoln Park. The tour group gets off at some sights, while at others, the bus drives by for a look. I didn't know anything about the gangster history of Chicago going in, so I was surprised to discover the sinister past behind many mundane-seeming locations that I pass by regularly! Tour booking is done online, and make sure to book early because the tours tend to sell-out!
