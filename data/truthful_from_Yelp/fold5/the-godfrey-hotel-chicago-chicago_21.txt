Great new hotel. Staff is over the top friendly and helpful. Joshua helped with checking us in and made sure we had all the information we needed. There is a inside /outside nightclub on the fourth floor that is very popular with the twenty/thirties something crowd. Techno music until 2am. Make sure you get a room away from that side of the hotel and you will be fine. Very accommodating and helpful staff. Well appointed rooms.
