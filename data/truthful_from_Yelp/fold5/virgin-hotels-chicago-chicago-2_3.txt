A great no hassle dog friendly hotel in the heart of Chicago. Walking distance to millennium park and lots of cultural and dining institutions.  What makes it better than most other hotels are the dog friendly and people friendly staff.  In fact, most of the staff are outstanding. Two that stuck out during our stay are from the Commons lounge: Isaac and Kelsey. Also, the blue-haired woman during check in and the valet were just so inviting. I can't wait to have another staycation at the Virgin Hotel! Did I mention the prices are to die for! They really make everything worth it, nothing costs more than if you were to buy it yourself in the neighborhood at a store. And the social hour in the Commons every day is also worth it. Sir Richard Branson has done it again with the Virgin Hotel Chicago!
