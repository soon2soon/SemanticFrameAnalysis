This is an awesome tour for any baseball fan.  You get to know the history and see things within the ballpark that you would've never been able to see by just going to a game.  From the broadcasting booth to the visitor and home locker room, the bleachers, and finally the dugout and field. Our tour guide spoke with ease and passion about the Cubs.  This tour is a must if you're visiting Chicago.
