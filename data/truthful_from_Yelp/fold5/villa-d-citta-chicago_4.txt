From start to finish Villa d' Citta was impeccable. Cathy met us at the villa for check in and gave us the grand tour. She also answered our questions about local dining and attractions. The room was wonderful, we enjoyed some time stargazing on the back deck and slept great. In the morning we were treated to waffles that we requested and a wonderful pizza. We walked to the Lincoln Park Zoo the following day(about a 10 minute walk) Even though check out was at 11, Cathy made it clear that we were welcome to stop back into the villa for refreshments and sandwiches throughout the day. We will surely be returning. Thanks Cathy!
