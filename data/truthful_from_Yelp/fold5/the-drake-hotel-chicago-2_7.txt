I think this hotel is just beautiful. I have been here several times for events and once to stay. My friend travels a lot and was able to get the penthouse suite on one occasion. It was beautiful!! The size of it was bigger than my apartment. I was in love with the Jacuzzi in the bathroom and the living room space was GIGANTIC!! I love the view as well. We could see across to the restaurant Spiggia (sp) and also the wonderful view on Lake Shore drive. Such a great place to stay! On other occasions I have been here for the Chicago Scene New Years Eve Party. The ball rooms are large and it's always a great time. My recent stint at the hotel was this pass Sunday I came for a Sassy Chicks event. The ball room they had it in was quite big, but because of the volume of people it was a little hard to get around. I love the d√©cor of this hotel and the service has always been great. I can't wait to come here to try the high tea time. I think this will be a great thing to do with my girls for some bday fun :)
