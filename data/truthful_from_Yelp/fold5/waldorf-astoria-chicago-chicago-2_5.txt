How can you not give this place 5 stars? It's the Walls! My bf and I wanted to stay at the Walls for a while but the price per night is pretty hefty so it became a long-term dream. Luckily this is a Hilton brand so that's how we worked our way in. I was surprised with a stay for Valentine's Day. Not only was he able to use his points even though it was a busy night, we even scored an upgraded room. Pulling in, luxury is all around. The valet warmly greet you, and all staff refuse tips. After checking in we made our way up to the room. This was hands down the nicest hotel I had been to and the room was evidence of that. Unfortunately we discovered out fridge didn't work. They were kind enough to send up another and were very apologetic. We spent much of the night at the bar but also tried to enjoy the room. The bathroom was massive with a walk-in shower and luxury tub. The next day we used the free town car to pick-up breakfast, again without pressure to tip. We enjoyed the rest of the day exploring the hotel and relaxing in the locker rooms. The staff was unbelievably friendly and accommodating. They fully comped us the non-functioning fridge and made our stay utterly enjoyable. I can't wait to get back here!
