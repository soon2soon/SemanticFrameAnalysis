Friendly, Friendly, Friendly. I just loved the staff. Helpful and kind at all hours of the day. My room was clean, but the smell-- even in a non-smoking room -- was a bit off. That aside, I was particularly impressed with the layout of the room. The Crowne is a modern interior design hotel, with clean lines and no frills. I love this type of design because it's thinking outside the realm of traditional hotel layout. That makes it an interesting and unique experience for the visitor. Suggestions: Get digital or cable tv in every room. Deodorize the carpets and drapes on a regular basis. Room Service - splendid. Food from "Dine" was awesome. Coffee was piping hot, served in a little decanter. I broke down from my vegetarian diet and ordered a club sandwich...it was worth falling off the wagon. Thick bacon, succulent turkey, great bread. Maybe it was because I was starving after traveling and skipping dinner, but I would eat that again on a full stomach. For the price, this was an excellent choice for staying downtown. There's a Walgreen's and Starbucks within one block and an assortment of restaurants (including yummy Greek Town!) within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again.
