I've have lived in Chicago or the surrounding towns all my life and I still loved the architecture tour. This is not just for tourists, it's a great experience for everybody! Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and I learned so many new random facts about our beautiful city of Chicago. The skyline is amazing cruising down the river on a Wendella tour is a great way to experience it while learning a thing or two in the process. HIGHLY recommend booking the architecture tour with Wendella Sightseeing Boats.
