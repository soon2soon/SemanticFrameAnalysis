The hotel is gorgeous inside. Loved the art everywhere. Our room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom and vanity / wardrobe area was perfect. Everything was impeccably clean and new, too. As for service, can't speak for too much because we didn't get anything special. They were well beyond your standard level of service when it came to cleaning the room and turndown. Check in person was friendly. Had a drink at the bar and nothing crazy there. To me, the location couldn't get much better. Close to a number of the current trendy restaurants, just a block or two from Michigan and just a few blocks walk to Millennium park.
