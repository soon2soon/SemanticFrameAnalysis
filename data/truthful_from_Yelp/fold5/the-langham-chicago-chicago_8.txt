Superb service. Amazing spa. Fabulous views. We enjoyed our stay at the Langham, in  Chicago.  The room was a good size but the bathroom was my favorite part of the room!  This hotel is located in a great area just north of the river and right on the Magnificent Mile.  We will definitely recommend this spot and will be back.
