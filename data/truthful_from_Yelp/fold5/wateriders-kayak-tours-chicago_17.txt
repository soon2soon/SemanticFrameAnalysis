We've been to Chicago a few times and absolutely love the Chicago river. If you like the architecture of downtown you should definable kayak it. We signed up for a classic 2.5 hr river kayaking tour. Our guide Joel is one of the better guides you will find on any type of excursion/tour you do. Its hard to find a more passionate guy who clearly loves what he does. When he tells stories about Chicago's history you forget about everything else and just want more information. He even quotes different authors on Chicago's history. The kayaking part is really fun too, it is a bit of a workout especially if its your first time. Half way through you really get the strokes down and then its a lot more efficient. You probably will get little wet from the paddle splashes (mostly shorts) so dress accordingly. All of the staff members are very pleasant. Safety is very important to these guys which was important to us as my wife was a bit apprehensive about the whole tour. Â Depending on how busy the river is at that time it can get somewhat choppy closer to the lake Michigan section, but not scary. Just pay attention and you will be just fine. They also provide zip locks, sunscreens, water, even sunglasses (spare ones left by other guests i am sure:-)) at no charge. Kayaks were in good shape too. Definitely try it. you won't regret it.
