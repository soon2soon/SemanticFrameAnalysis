If you are looking for an amazing and life changing travel experience for your child, look no further.  Road Less Traveled is unparalleled in the kind of trips they create, the leaders they hire and the unforgettable memories that are made as a result.  We wanted our daughter to have a language immersion experience as well as a trip with a service component.  After doing exhaustive research, we found that RLT was the only organization that really wants your child to learn and grow.  They are meticulous about the staff they hire and they give them weeks of training.  My daughter went abroad with no one she knew and I had absolute confidence that she would be safe, secure and nurtured because I knew RLT had all the details covered, even the ones I hadn't thought of!  My daughter went to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands and said it was one of the most amazing trips she would probably ever go on in her life.  She met life long friends, learned about new cultures and learned a lot about herself.  Now she wants to go on every Road Less Traveled trip!
