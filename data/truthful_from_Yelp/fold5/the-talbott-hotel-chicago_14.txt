LOVED this hotel! Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, friendly service, apple tv in every room, spacious, clean, free wifi, close to the shops on the Magnificent Mile. They even gave us a free upgrade because it was our first time staying with them. I was really impressed and would highly recommend people to stay here when visiting chicago.
