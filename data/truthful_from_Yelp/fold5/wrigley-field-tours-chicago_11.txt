For my birthday, and in honor of my parents being in town I was told to choose the activity for the day.  I wanted to do something we hadn't done since we moved here, which seems nuts since we've been to so many games.   The Wrigley Field Tour was $25 and over an hour and a half long.  Completely worth the money and time!  I would recommend going on a non-game day though - more tour for the same price!   They give you plenty of time to take pictures in the dugout and on the field.  There's walking galore - but if you're used to sitting in the 500's, you'll be fine!   The walk past the organ and some of the press boxes went by super fast - but then again there'a  ton of stuff to see on this tour!  Move it people.   Our guide was informative and funny.  Even if I wasn't a fan of the Cubs, or heck baseball in general, just the history alone behind this ballpark is incredible.  Check it out though!  Worth the time and the adults were cheese-ing around just as much as the kiddos!
