i purchased a livingsocial escape deal, which gave me a night in an executive king, free parking, and a complimentary bottle of wine for $119 (excluding tax), which turned out to be an amazing bargain. the parking garage was close by, and processing was a breeze. front desk staff "matt" was very friendly and helpful, getting us our bottle right as we finished the paperwork. the room was nice, bed was extremely cozy. easiest sleep i could have gotten. everything in the bathroom worked well, and they even provided us with robes. we missed the free breakfast but all in all an excellent experience. a big thank you to livingsocial.com for leading me here!
