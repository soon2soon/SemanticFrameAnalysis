You really, really have to get there on time--they take off just when they say the tour starts.  So get there early and have a coffee at McDonald's.  You will love the tour. Eric was our tour guide and he is amazing and so energetic.  We had a lot of fun and he had some great information on serial killers I had never heard before.  And I'm from Chicago!
