My first experience actually being in charge of an event where I wanted us to arrive in style for an event. I was scouring on the net for a 20 passenger hummer that could accomidate us. I saw that VIP had Hummers, but no reviews. So I admit, that I was a wee bit concerned. I also was worried proms would hinder us, but alas! VIP came through! We initially wanted to have the limo arrive at 6pm. A couple days before, VIP wanted to change the time to 5:45. I was already telling people to arrive at 5:30 so, I didn't think it would be a problem. Of course there was. Our driver, James, swagged down our block at 5:30 gleaming in the cloudy sky like gold teeth on a rapper. To our dismay, we had to wait for a couple of couples and couldn't leave until 5:57. We were on time for our initial contract time, but not for the new one. I felt bad, and apologized but James was cool. We arrived at our location with the populace in awe! They started taking pics of us! ok, they were taking pics of the limo, but I'm sure some of us got in them. They probably thought we were with Kanye or Jamie Foxx, cuz we were just that tight. :) James had 2 other stops to make before he was to pick us up at 10:30, so I was concerned that we threw off the schedule, how-sin-ever, at 10:26, James came cruising down the Ave. We made good our extro and all 18 of us arrived at our destination safely and soundly. I've already referred VIP today to a coworker, and would recommend again. Thanks VIP
