Being an entertainment marketing & promotion person for 15 years, part of my job is accommodation. This means not only for myself, but for executives and artists. I've stayed at most of the hotels in downtown Chicago over the course of 15 years. I was invited to opening night & got a room for the evening. From the moment you walk in , the doorman, lobby staff, & manager are very pleasant. The interior is very luxurious. The elevators (a pet peeve of mine) moved pretty quickly. I had a room on the 14th floor which had a beautiful room. Being boutique-style a la New York City, it did not dissappoint in its comfortability. The bed is amazingly comfortable with a great glass shower in the bathroom. The tv is full-hd & 42 inches. I decided to close the evening in the 1I0 Roofscape Lounge on the 4th floor. This place is must-see clubbing! The space holds 750 total and has a retractable roof that will KILL in the summer! The staff is once again courteous & attentive. Water came in an artistic bottle (free) & my glass was never empty. One wall houses a romantic fireplace, great considering theses last few months. This hotel appears to be angling for upscale but down-to-earth customer service. I can't wait to go back. Last point; very affordable for the luxury. Easily-accessible to the downtown area by foot or cab. I love it.
