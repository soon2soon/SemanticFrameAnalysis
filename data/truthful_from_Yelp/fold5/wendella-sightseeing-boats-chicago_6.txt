Loved loved loved the architectural boat tour!  It was a great way to learn some Chicago history and checking out the amazing buildings along the river.   We enjoyed our 2pm tour on a nice Saturday afternoon in October.  It was perfect weather for the tour.  Our guide was knowledgeable and did a great job highlighting the major buildings on the tour. Our 75 minute tour went by in a flash.  If you go with Wendella for your tour, order your tickets online beforehand to save a few dollars.
