+++ - Great knowledgeable tour guide - Subtle humor and jokes - The $7 margaritas downstairs TIPS - the 90 minute tour combines architecture and lake michigan ride, it's the best of both worlds for the same price - If you get a tour around sunset time, you get to see the cty light up, it's really neat - The architecture tour, she speeds through the speech to keep up with the boat, so you really Â have to pay attention - Bring something warm, it may get cool on the water - If you go with a group, someone should go immediately to the bar, because it fills up quickly within the first ten minutes of loading - The ticket tells you to show up a half hour early, we showed up at 6:50 for a 7:00 pm tour and we managed to still make it in the line to get in (They began boarding at 6:55)
