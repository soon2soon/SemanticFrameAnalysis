Halloween is my very favorite holiday - and this year I hadn't made any decent plans for dress-up, so I decided to "treat" myself to the Weird Chicago Ghosts, Gangsters and Ghouls Tour on Halloween. So glad that I did! The bus was very comfortable - kept at a nice temperature -- which you never know about when it's cold outside. Some people like to crank that heat up so high you wonder how anyone can breathe. Not the case here -- just right. I realize that's a personal preference - but not only was it perfect, but our host, Jennifer checked to see how everyone was doing. She also pointed out where the bathroom stops were -- which was a really good idea -- this is a three hour tour, so there is a good chance you'll need to use the restroom! Jennifer was a fantastic guide and is very, very good at what she does (and the driver was cool, also). I was really looking forward to this adventure, because, despite being a native, I'd been gone for many years - and, I really wanted to learn more about its very rich history. In fact, it's hard to believe how she keeps all that interesting, very detailed information together. It probably helps that she is a paranormal investigator - as I understood it -- so she has a great passion for her work. Her storytelling ability is top-notch and very inclusive - she involves members of the audience which really livens things up! I've read a lot of material about Chicago -- out of curiosity and as a writer and I STILL learned a great deal on this tour - things I know I probably never would have found out if not for this tour. This tour was jam packed with many historical facts and lots of very interesting tidbits about the city. For anyone looking to find out more about Chicago -- whether you're a native or a visitor -- this tour is not like a classic sight-seeing tour - it is far more in-depth and you can learn about all of the very colorful characters that gave Chicago the reputation it still has today!
