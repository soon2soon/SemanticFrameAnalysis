Nick Russo house musician for 25 years at Jilly's, (closed a couple of years ago) debuted at the Coq D'Or bar at the Drake last night.  Fantastic music!   Great choice Drake Hotel !!  I understand he is scheduled for nights in the near future back at the Coq D'Or bar/Drake hotel  Highly recommend !!!
