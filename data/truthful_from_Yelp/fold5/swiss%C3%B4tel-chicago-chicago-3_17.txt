World class hotel with superior meeting/event space on the top floor. The hotel is modern, sophisticated, elegant, and has a touch of European charm. The hotel offers Starbucks, FedEx, smartElevators, a concierge, room service, and unique room view (triangular hotel). I have stayed here 3 times, and they are consistently hospitable.
