We stay here several times a year. One time, it was for almost a week.  The location is great--easy access to many restaurants on foot as well as short cab rides (they have a car as well), shopping, and a huge movie theater with reclining seats around the corner.  Room service and breakfast is excellent, but oh, those large Midwest portions....  Obviously great beef and my favorite cocktails in Chicago. One caveat--let's get some nuts, olives, or other GF friendly complimentary munchies.  For this level of cocktails, pretzels?  Really? Paid $5 for nuts.  Annoying since city prices for cocktails. Staff is accommodating, friendly, and helpful.  Rooms are light and large and generally well equipped.  However, the liquid soap, shampoo, etc. frankly burns since there is cinnamon and menthol in it.  Ouch.  You can ask for less spicy options, but I kept forgetting until I was about to shower.  One BIG update:  they upgraded the Internet so now it is flawless. Thank heavens.  Incidentally, the media rooms' projectors are updated as well. All good. Prices are reasonable for the quality of your stay and they have some good specials.  The 800 number is not always on top of this, so go to their website and if a question, call the hotel itself on the weekdays.  They are service oriented.  Have stayed at Four Seasons, the Drake, etc., and this is my go to hotel.
