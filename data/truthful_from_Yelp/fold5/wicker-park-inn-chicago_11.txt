I'm so glad this is where I stayed for my first trip to Chicago. For starters, you probably can't find a better location in the city, especially for such a cheap price tag. It's a block off Milwaukee Ave and an easy 10 minute walk away from the Duncan L stop, so should you find yourself bored of exploring the Wicker Park neighborhood (a difficult feat), you can take the train to anywhere else in the city, easy peasy. We stayed in the Provence room, which is I think the smallest room (with the private bathroom located down the hall). It faces the street so I would venture to say it's also the "loudest" room in the house, but noise pollution was never a problem - and we stayed over the weekend when everyone was out and drunk. The only real noise I heard at night was the L going over its tracks in the distance, but it was hardly a nuisance. The quarters were slightly cramped, but this was mostly because we dumped our suitcases on the floor instead of using the closet. The inn owners are extremely nice and accommodating. They go out of their way to make sure you know how to get around the city. The rooms are stocked with cultural mags like Time Out Chicago, so you'll be able to make plans if you haven't made an itinerary. Breakfast is always set when you wake up in the morning with fresh fruits and pastries and housekeeping is cleaning everything up by noon. The owners live across the street as opposed to on the property, which is great because they are right there if something goes awry but it doesn't feel like you're imposing on a stranger's living space. Also, they let you store your luggage in the hall closet after you've checked out so you don't have to lug it around your last day in the city. In sum, I will definitely stay here again.
