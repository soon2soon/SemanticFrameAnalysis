YES. This place rocks my world. Free wifi. Friendly staff. A GLASS SHOWER. Man, why have I been staying at the Travelodge in downtown Chicago for so long? I don't even think I paid all that much more for the Silversmith than I would at the Travelodge. I know my friends and I got a particularly good deal off Expedia as well, so definitely check that out before you book. Just an interesting observation: I wonder how long this place will look "modern" and "trendy" as opposed to "schticky" and "tacky." It is ultra-modern in its appearance (minimalist, lots of glass, stark black and white decor) and I just wonder how many years it will be until it makes the ultra-modern to tacky transition. Think shag carpet, flower wallpaper, and those plastic egg chairs that were awesome in the 70s and how ridiculous they seem now. Watch this space.
