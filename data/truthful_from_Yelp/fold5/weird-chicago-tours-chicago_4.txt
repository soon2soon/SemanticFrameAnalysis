We booked a private Weird Chicago Tour as part of our wedding day for our guests, many of whom are from outside Chicago. Gus, the bus-driver picked us up right outside our hotel, and Sunny, our tour guide, was absolutely fantastic. We opted for a mixed bag of stories and stops from Weird Chicago's various tours including gangster tales, ghost stories, tragedies, and just plain random weirdness. Sunny's stories were absolutely fascinating and when she announced that we were heading for our final stop, we didn't want it to end! Our guests raved about the experience and, quite frankly, so did we. Â Thank you to Sunny, Gus, and the rest of the folks at Weird Chicago for being such a great part of our special day!
