This hotel exceeded my expectations! I stayed here in May 2013! Everything about the suite was very modern! The curtains opened by the click if a button ! The bathroom had a tv installed in the mirror and both a spacious bath tub and a separate rain shower! It had 2 additional TVs one in the bedroom and the other on the living area! It had a keurig coffee maker which was a nice touch !
