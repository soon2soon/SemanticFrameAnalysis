I worked with Jay at Sunset Travel to plan accommodations and airline tickets for our honeymoon next May.  He was absolutely amazing to work with.  He responded to all my emails very quickly and took care of all the details I probably couldn't have figured out on my own (like how to obtain the right type of travel insurance coverage).  He also cc'ed me on all the correspondence he had with the hotel and airline, which I really appreciated.  I will definitely go back for all future travels!  Thanks, Jay!
