A nice pleasant surprise as I thought this could have been an over-hyped hotel.  Starts with attached parking which is very nice versus having to turn over the car to a valet. Great service at the front desk with multiple people behind the desk to serve you.  The rooms are top notch.  I arrived in the morning for a meeting so my room wasn't ready but they checked my bag and gave me a call when the room was available. The valet brought up my bag and gave me a tour of the room.  I thought it unique as the valet kept the door open while giving me the tour which in sure for female guests....it would be appreciated.  Room was bright and clean.  I was lucky to get a spa room so I had free weights and yoga mat and warming towel for my morning workout.   Bed was extremely comfortable and check out the pillow menu so you can order up the perfect pillow.  Also like the TV built into the bathroom mirror and the automated blinds and lights.   Had several breakfast and lunch meals all were great. Lastly if you are a Chicagoan you will get some very nice views that you are not used to seeing given the location of the building.   Meeting spaces are a little strange.  I think they built the building with the supports on the Outler edge of the building and they put the meeting rooms on the outside.  So the rooms  are odd shaped it have big support posts in the middle. Overall great few days and can't wait to comeback when I'm not working. Cheers. John
