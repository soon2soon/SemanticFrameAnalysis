I have flown Virgin America 4 times and have been impressed every time.  I love that each seat has an individual tv to control with free channels.  You can purchase movies but you can have plenty of free tv options.  I also love that they allow families with young children to board before most of the passengers.  It is very helpful.  I h Ave never encountered a Virgin America employee thay wasn't friendly and helpful.
