I am a huge fan.  We were here for a couple nights this winter.  The Langham Chicago has probably the nicest and most helpful staff of any hotel we've stayed in recently.  I felt welcome upon arrival.  Our suite was well-appointed with tremendous river views.  Luxurious bathrooms, in room espresso maker, and the room decor was unique yet comfortable.  I wanted to move in and stay awhile. We did order breakfast from room service and it arrived in a timely manner, was still really warm, and tasty.  My only regret is we didn't try the afternoon tea. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
