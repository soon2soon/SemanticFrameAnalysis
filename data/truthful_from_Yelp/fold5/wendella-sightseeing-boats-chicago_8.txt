The 75 min architecture river tour was fantastic! It was totally worth the the $32 (if you order online, you get 5% off, so after tax, it's just under $32) The boat ride was beautiful, and the tour guide was great! I spent the whole ride frantically trying to cram all the interesting bits of knowledge into my brain. Â I'm sure I retained hardly any of the trivia, but it was a relaxing and fun boat ride! Also, the best seat (at least on my particular ride) was on the bench on the right side of the boat. Almost everything they pointed out was on the right side, so I had a front row view to everything! I took the 6:30pm tour, so the weather was perfect (not too hot) but it did get chilly near the end. If you are like me and get cold easily, bring a jacket in case. Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago!
