This hotel was perfect for our needs.  The location was great.  The start of the Magnificent Mile was just around the corner.  It only takes 10 minutes to walk to the Millennium Park.  It's about a 20minute walk to the Willis Tower but you can take some other means of transportation to get there.   A lot of restaurants near the hotel.  a 7-11, Walgreens nearby.  It's a very modern looking hotel.  Everything looked sleek and new.  We loved our room.  We were on the 36th floor with an awesome view of the river, Trump Tower and Marina City.  The room was very clean and it was good size room, pretty large  in my opinion.  My only complaint is that I could hear our neighbor's comings and going and closing their door at night.    Other than that, everything was great.  Service was great.  Views from the Penthouse was awesome.  I highly recommend this hotel.  I would definitely stay here again when in Chicago.
