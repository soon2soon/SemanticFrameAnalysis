We tried out the two hour double kayak rental courtesy of a Youswoop coupon.  We had a really great experience. The staff was super friendly, especially Scott, who helped us get settled and into the water.They provided us with life vests, bottles of water, and even complimentary dry boxes for us to use in order to keep our camera and phones safe.  We made it from the dock to a bit past the Trump Tower and back in our 2 hours.  We had plenty of time to stop, take pictures, and enjoy the view. This was definitely a fun way to see downtown. It was easy to navigate the river, but keep an eye out for larger boats. Their wake can make it hard to navigate. Also, be prepared to have your picture taken by every tourist who passes you on an architecture tour boat.
