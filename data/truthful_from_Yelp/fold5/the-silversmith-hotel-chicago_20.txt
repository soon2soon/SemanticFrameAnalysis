My friends and me have stayed at this hotel for two of our trips to Chicago. The hotel is newly remodeled; the rooms are very clean and spacious. They gave us a discount for booking with them again. The entire staff was phenomenal, and saw to our requests right away. The hotel is at a great location; you can walk to all the main attractions. Â I will definitely be booking with them again!!
