Top Fleet Inc. was so responsive when I was researching services for a group event . Ryan (owner) responded very quickly to my request and answered all my questions as well. Top Fleet, Inc was selected for our group event that was held Wednesday evening (8/27/14). Bruce was our driver. Bruce was dressed in a nice suit, arrived early, introduced himself to me and let me know the plan for the night. The car was a new dark, Lincoln SUV stretch. Interior was very clean. White wine, beer and water was chilling for our guests. A cooler with also available in the trunk as well. It was perfect, as we had food items from our event that needed to be chilled. The ride was scenic - from Roosevelt Road going East to Lake Shore Drive and finally our destination Navy Pier. All the guests were comfortable in the car. We enjoyed our drinks and pizza along the the drive to see the fireworks at Navy Pier. Bruce sent me a reminder text to let me know where the car would be when our party was ready to return back. The ride back to the restaurant was smooth. Once we arrived, Bruce removed all our packages in the trunk. Bruce is friendly and a very professional. My Manager was pleased with the service. Top Fleet Inc., will definitely be selected again in the future.
