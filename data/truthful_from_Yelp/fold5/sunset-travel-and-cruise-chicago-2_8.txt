Martha is by far the best travel agent I have worked with.  My friends and I were booking a vacation to the Dominican Republic on Expedia since it was the cheapest price we found.  However, as we all clicked book, some of the people in my party were not able to get the vacation package because Expedia had apparently sold out for that flight.  Desperate to find the best deal, I checked other sites and called 2 other travel agents in which one was only concerned with making a sale and the other never sent me a quote like she said she would.  Martha genuinely wants to help you get the best deal possible and upon hearing what happened, she sought to find the best and closest price to the vacation we booked the previous day.  She is very personable and quick to reply to your emails as well as calls to keep you informed.  I have found my travel agent for future trips.  Thank you Sunset Travel!
