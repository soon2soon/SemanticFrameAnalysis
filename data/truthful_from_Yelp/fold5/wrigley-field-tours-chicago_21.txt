While my guy might be disillusioned by the state of the Chicago Cubs (his "heart has been broken just too many times," he tells me), that fact didn't prevent us from taking a fantastic tour of this baseball mecca recently. An introductory video sets the tone for the tour ahead that includes sitting on the bleachers, visiting the Visitors' club house, the press box, some box seats, the Cubs' clubhouse, the dugouts and the FIELD...really, everything you could ever want to see in a behind-the-scenes tour of Wrigley Field. Listening to the rich history of not only the stadium that has come to be known as Wrigley Field, but also of the Chicago Cubs (did YOU know they used to play on the west side?), you can almost forget that it has been 101 years since they won the World Series. Almost. The pride of the ballpark is evident in the gusto of the tour guides, the diversity of the tour's attendees (we had Boston Red Sox fans, Yankees fans and even a White Sox fan or two during our tour) and the enthusiasm everyone displays in getting photographs while you're right down on the field. Truly a tour for all those who are fans of everything baseball, this is not to be missed. Even though $25 seems a bit steep for a ticket, you get a great tour and a true behind-the-scenes look at the field. In my opinion, it's worth every penny.
