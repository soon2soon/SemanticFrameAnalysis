Could not have been more of a perfect night for a 21st birthday! Â From start to finish our driver Edwin was nothing but awesome! He was out going, friendly and always cautious about drivers around him. It made the whole scenario a lot of fun because we did not have to worry at all. From the beginning talking with Clara who set the whole event up for me to the end of the night when we got dropped off back at home everything ran remarkably smooth. We made three pit stops before headed back home consisting of a few historical sites to take photos and some bars. Edwin was always willing to help by offering to take pictures and wait as long as we wanted to get back on the trolley. I could not have asked for a better team to have helped me through the night.
