This was absolutely the nicest, most welcoming hotel I have ever encountered.  The desk attendants, bellhops, and doormen were friendly and helpful! Little things make this place wonderful.  Free (and delicious!) morning coffee, beautiful white sheets and towels, the option to decline housekeeping, and the prime location (within walking distance of everything you could want!) all make this place worth every penny.
