This tour is fun for the whole gang and affordable. We found it because the official architecture tour is really expensive (like, even for infants), especially if you are booking for 12 people like we were. So we opted for this tour - and so glad we did. This was more affordable than the architecture tour, but we still got lots of info on the architecture and the history. We had a great guide who was fun, funny, personable and knowledgeable. I never once felt unsafe or bored. I highly recommend ordering your tickets online, probably in advance if it's peak season. If you're picky about where you sit (i.e, you want to sit in the front of the boat), you'll want to arrive in advance of the boarding time to make sure you get the seat you want. I don't really think there's a bad seat though. Bonus points for the drinks being affordable!
