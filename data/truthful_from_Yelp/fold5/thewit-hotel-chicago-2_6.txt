This hotel is one of the hottest in Chicago! Staff is very proffesional. They help you from check in to the day you check out. There is a bar downstairs- our bartender Luis was awesome, plus their food was good. Also, a gym, spa and best of ALL their rooftop is HOT. Amazing place to stay for the weekend. My boyfriend and I had an amazing Valentines weekend!
