I had a Top Fleet limo after the Jay-Z & Beyonc√© concert last week for a group of 10 friends. The concert was at Solider Field, so we wanted to ensure we had a ride right after the concert! Jerry was our driver and even picked up Champagne for us to have when we arrived to the limo. He was very patient with us, as there was a ton of traffic and congestion in the area. We had a great time and were happy to have had the service for such a fun night! I recommend Top Fleet to anyone!
