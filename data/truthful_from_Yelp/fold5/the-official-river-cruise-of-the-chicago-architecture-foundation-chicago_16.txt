When we did the cruise the weather was nice. We had a 3:30 pm cruise so it was also VERY SUNNY and I wish I brought a hat. That is my only tip...the rest of the trip was fantastic! ! The tour guide was a volunteer she was passionate and knowledgeable about Chicago's architectural history.  She was engaging and had a great attitude. The view from the top of the boat was amazing and there was plenty of room for everyone.  They serve drinks which were a bit pricey but thats part of being a tourist, and the bar area takes card which was awesome. The boat also goes at a slow enough pace that you can get some really good photos! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see the city from a different (magnificent) angle.
