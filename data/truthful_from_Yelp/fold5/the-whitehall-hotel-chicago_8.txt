The review is based on Value as this is not a 5 star hotel.  The price is extremely reasonable considering the location and amenities.  I don't think there is a better value in the city. Check in was a breeze after being greeted by the valet.  Lobby is on the small side but cozy.  There is a cafe and restaurant adjoining.   The room was located on the 17th floor away from elevators as requested.  Corner room with excellent views. The bathroom tile is impressive. The toilet is a low profile- good for kids but could be a problem for a basketball player. Took a shower before dinner and had luke warm water. That was really disappointing.   However, in the morning, the water was as hot as you could want. Bathroom was very clean and provided top notch toiletries.   Robes are also a nice touch. TV froze and had to call front desk but phone on desk didn't work... no worries there are two other phones to use.  TV repaired in less than 5 minutes. Room was very clean. Superior bed linens. Bed was a little too soft for my taste but I slept well nonetheless.   2 Elevators and they are small.  On the ride down in the morning one seemed to free fall then didn't properly level. It was out of service when I returned an hour later.  So, now only Room included a Continental breakfast- their version is coffee, juice and one blueberry muffin.  Now, the muffin was warmed and included soft butter rounds. Service was excellent.  Holiday music playing, table linens along with a nice street view. I forgot to bring down cash thinking it would be a serve yourself.  The waiter said that the tip was included in the prepaid rate but I think he was just being nice.   Of course, I returned with a sizable tip and though he reiterated it was already covered, I told him Merry Christmas.
