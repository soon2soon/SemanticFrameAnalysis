Having never been a train commuter, I love Union Station. I would imagine if I had to pass through this place every day, it would get a bit old. But this is one of the few places in Chicago that I visit and feel like an absolute tourist. I marvel at the high ceilings in the grand room. I think about the sheer number of people who must have gone up and down those stairs to make them so indented. The little bar in the station is great, too. It's one of those hidden gem places the tourists seem to walk right past. As far as cool buildings in Chicago go, this is on my top 5.
