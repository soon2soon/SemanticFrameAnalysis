Stayed there for 5 months or might have been longer for like $150 a month.  It was fantastic.  Great service, too.  Course this was 1968. I was looking for a job as a secretary then (before college), and the operator took all my calls and messages.  The front desk took all my mail.  Everyone was sooo nice to me all the time and helpful.  Fond, fond memories... And to think to this day I've never been to the Tip Top Tap there...very sad. Update:  Reading all these reviews about the rooms being teeny tiny.  Well, that's what I had in 1968, but I was in a corner of the hotel where my view up high was fantastic with a great breeze.  I had to share a bathroom, but nobody ever was hardly ever in there but one time.  I was only 25, poor and just loved it.  Now I have money, lots of crap and wish I were back there.  See?  You can't be pleased.
