Had a great experience using them. I reserved over the phone the morning of my departure (I was coming back to O'Hare then traveling to S. Elgin). I was quoted $55 which was fair. As soon as I landed I got a text saying the car was there and for my to call or text when I was at bag claim exit door 1D. Walked outside and then a black town car was there in 2 min to pick us up. Phil was the driver and very nice. Ride was clean and luxurious. Overall great experience and way worth it over a cramped, uncomfortable taxi.
