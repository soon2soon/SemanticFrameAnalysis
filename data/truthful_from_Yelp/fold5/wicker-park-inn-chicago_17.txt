I was here just the other day, and I LOVE this place!! It's so cute, and ALL f the the rooms that I saw were immaculate. David, the GM was so sweet and helped us with any information we needed. He even went out and got a bottle of wine for us! That's the kind of service you can expect from a quality Inn such as this. The location is perfect. There's everything you could possible want just steps away. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and family.
