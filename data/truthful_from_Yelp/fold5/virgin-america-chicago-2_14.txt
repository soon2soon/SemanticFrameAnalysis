Took me 28 years to lose my Virgin-ity, but it was worth the wait! Comparable in price to Southwest, but they have way more goodies on board (TV's, free Wifi, movies, instant messaging, etc.) hip staff, and the boarding process isn't a complete free for all. They don't fly to every city, but if they go where your final destination is trust me...it's a party in the sky!
