Honestly this was so much fun!!!! My friends and I got a Groupon and booked the "Ghosts and Gangsters Tour" at night. Now, I have lived in Chicago all my life and yes this was the first time I did something like this - I know I know. Anyway this was such a great experience! The buildings are so beautiful on the river lit up at night and the stories of old gangsters and spooky ghosts was very entertaining and quite informative. The staff is very professional and keep good track of you to make sure you don't get lost! Afterwards my friends and I went to Dick's Last Resort to eat on the river, which you can see in my other reviews. I recommend this to all! Friends, couples, families etc....you will have a great time!
