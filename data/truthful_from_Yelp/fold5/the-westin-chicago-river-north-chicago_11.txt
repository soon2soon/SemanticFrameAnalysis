I have stayed here at least once a month for the past three years on business. Here is what you need to know: Good *Staff here is A+ with concierge, front desk, lobby bar, sam in the gym and club lounge. *Rooms are dated, but very spacious and never too far from the elevators. *Great location to restaurants *Easy to grab a taxi to meetings in the loop or airport. Just OK *Older rooms *Not on the lake *Can be soldout bc its that good.
