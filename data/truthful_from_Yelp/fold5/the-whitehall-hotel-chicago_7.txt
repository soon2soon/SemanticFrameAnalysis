I have stayed in many hotels in my life from Dubai to Rome and this was one of the best hotel experiences ever, I arrived early and the staff was courteous and professional allowing me to check in early and upgraded me to a Suite at no additional charge. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the service was great! I would recommend this hotel for it's cleanliness and location, it's not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. Furthermore what separates this hotel from others is the fact that it has a true boutique feel too it, unlike the other hotels with there "corporate policies and stupid reward points" no robots working at the front desk, real people that make you feel warm and at home. Special thanks to Elizabeth and Cesar.
