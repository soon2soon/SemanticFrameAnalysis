This was my first trip to the Chicago area and I was pleasantly surprised and impressed just how nice the hotel staff was. They let my wife and I check in early which was great after a long drive! Â Right after checkin I was given a welcome package with a list if things to do by the concierge desk. The room we were given is in great condition, very clean and had the most comfortable pillows I had ever used in my life which led me to buy the same:)! We ordered our breakfast off the order slip left in the room twice and it was a very well put together and a delicious breakfast! I will leave a photo of it!! The room views were AWSOME I had a room with a view from the front and back and it really helped me see the beauty of the city! From check in to check out my stay was exactly what I needed and hoped for! Thank you everyone for making my 1st Chicago trip so memorable. Shout Outs to Anthony AFOM, Brandon FD and the MGR Kelly you guy were great!
