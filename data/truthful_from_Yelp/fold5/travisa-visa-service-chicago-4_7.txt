I use Travisa often for my company outside of Peoria, IL located about 3 hours from Chicago.  I often acquire business visas to Brazil, Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, China, Oman, and soon Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Russia.  Today I will speak strictly of my experience obtaining a rush visa to Australia.   Australia visas are normally obtained electronically.  The process does not usually take long; you fill out a form on-line, provide payment information, and in a day or two you have your visa.  Unfortunately, due an error, we needed our visa very very quickly.  Actually, I had one hour to secure the visa or my traveler's $10,000 ticket was going down the drain.  I called Travisa and explained the situation.  I spoke with George and Josh who were both very helpful.  They spoke with their manager, Kim, and 45 minutes later, I had the visa and my traveler was on his plane.  It's as close as you can cut it, but all of the employees at Travisa made it happen. Say what you will about prices or difficult location, what I needed was a human being to speak to and action to be taken.  That's exactly what I got.  My company will continue to use Travisa for its traveling needs.
