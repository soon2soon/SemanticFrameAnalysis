Union station is the primary train hub for downtown chicago.  It boasts several restaurants inside, mostly grab and go fair and nothing too fancy.  It get's very busy, and the architecture is amazing.   I would take a grip to the grand hall. It's HUGE and really is a site to see.   If you are traveling, there are lockers on-site that you can rent for the day to store your things in.
