My in laws came in town and I had heard great things about wierd Chicago tours, so I immediately booked the ghost goblins and gangsters tour for us. $30 a person may seem a bit much now a days for a tour but I promise you it is worth every penny! Our tour guide was amazing, he kept us engaged the entire time and this is no easy task as the tour was a little over 3 hours long! He was incredibly knowledgable and well ... just amazing!   My husband and I had just moved to Chicago and we learned alot that we never would have if we went on any other ghost tour. Although I was on crutches (our driver was the sweetest lady helping me on and off at every stop) I loved the fact that we were getting on and off at almost every  stop instead of being stuck on a bus for 3 hours. We also loved that we stopped half way for a cocktail.    We highly recommend this to anyone who is into the ghost and gangster stuff, we are already planning our next tour (the haunted pub crawl)!! One last thing .. YOU MUST BRING YOUR CAMERA (best to use a real camera and not a smartphone)! My mother in law didn't seem to be much of a believer until we looked through the photos when the tour was over. At one stop "death alley" my husband took several pictures of the brick wall as instructed by our guide. I still am freaked out bc we have a picture CLEAR as day of a mans face on the brick wall! You do not HAVE to be a believer to enjoy the tour, but you just might find yourself being one by the end of the evening.
