For my first visit to Chicago this was a perfect location and hotel for the experience.  The staff was extremely professional and helpful!  They were very knowledgeable about what we asked about and if they didn't know they would ask someone else who did know.  We returned a rental car in about a block from here so it was an easy walk to the hotel.  It is also only about 2-3 blocks to the Orange Line train that takes you to Midway if thats the airport your flying in or out of.  $2.25 for a ride to and from airport is great.  The room was spacious and the Keurig machine and mini fridge was nice, I love tea in the morning and evening and this was perfect for making hot water. But for you coffee drinkers they have 4 K-cups there to choose from. The beds with all the pillows was super comfy and the city view was pretty good although they offered a river view for $15 more. I prefer the city view although you get city with the river too.  Its right across the street from the river and bridge. Nicely located less than a mile from most major attractions (all walking distance).  They have computers for use with a printer for printing out your boarding passes or researching the area.  They also provide free wifi and they have a bar restaurant downstairs. Only thing I would have liked is a stronger shower head, it was too soft and took too long to rinse hair. Also you could hear the water pipes really well when other rooms were showering etc.  Other than that it was a very nice Hotel and location. I would certainly visit again.  I think my friend got the reservations through Travel Zoo so it was a better than their normal rate so check that out.
