Stayed here last night in Chicago; I don't have much in the way of American hostels to compare it to, but I was happy with everything.  Staff was friendly and helpful, dormitory was clean (and air conditioned!) and bed was comfortable.  Obviously if you're looking for 5 star accommodation this isn't your place, and I was a bit sad when the hot water went cold mid-shower, but it was also late evening on Saturday, so fair enough.  There's a ton of stuff nearby, but even on Saturday night it wasn't disturbingly loud at all.  And eating the basic but filling breakfast on the deck in the morning with a bunch of random kindred spirits is always a nice way to start the day.  Will definitely stay again if/when I'm back in Chicago.
