So windy and cold but that's Chicago :) must take this cruise if you are coming to Chicago! It's fun, fascinating, and educational! Learned so many things about the architecture and it made me appreciate the city a little more :) the tour guides are funny and lovely people! Dress warm because the wind is brutal during the winter but I'll take this tour again in the summer :) it's a 75 min long tour for about $36 each
