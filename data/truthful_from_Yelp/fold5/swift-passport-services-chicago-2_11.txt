Like an idiot I booked a trip to Cancun with some friends when my passport had expired. I realized I had 13 days till my flight and could not risk going to the post office. So I did my research and called these guys. I had a few "blond" moments and they worked with  me to let  me know what I needed before I came in to renew my passport. I came on Thursday morning 8/8 and they called me end of day on Friday to let me know to pick up my passport on Monday. The service was quite good...Turns out I spent a year in Costa Rica back in 05 when 2 of the employees were living there. If you ever find yourself in a JAM. I think they can take care of you even 6 days before the flight leaves. They answered VISA questions that I had about other countries. Awesome.. Thank you
