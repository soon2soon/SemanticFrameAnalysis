Loved everything about it - great location, Walking distance to Millenium Park, magnificent Mile, business on Wacker, tons of restaurants, bars, theater and art. And yet it was reasonably priced compared to other downtown Chicago hotels. Spacious, elegantly decorated rooms w/ extremely comfy beds and desks w/ lamps (very nice, don't always find those now). Free use of computers and printers just off the lobby, which was a great convenience, fine gym, and bright and interesting lobby bar, restaurant and lounging area. Loved the bath products, too. Would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in Chicago. Tip: after hearing complaints from noise from the trains on lower floors, when the option came up at booking to request upgrade to upper floor room, if available, for just $15 extra, I took it, and glad I did. Got a 10th (top) floor room (1006), and noise was no problem. Thanks for a great stay!
