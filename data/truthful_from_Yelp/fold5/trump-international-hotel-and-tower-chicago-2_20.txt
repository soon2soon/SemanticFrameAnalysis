Fabulous hotel. The suite is lovely with great amenities. I loved the bathroom mirror TV - it's perfect because I love TV when I'm getting ready in the morning! Everything was luxurious from the bath/shower, to the comfortable bed with "pillow menu", gorgeous kitchenette, comfortable furniture and great view of the city. I was also impressed with the pool, sauna and steam room. The staff was very courteous and professional. Trump's name is literally on EVERYTHING, but somehow it feels right :)
