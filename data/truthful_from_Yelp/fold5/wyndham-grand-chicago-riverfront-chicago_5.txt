What an awesome place. For my first trip to Chicago this was the way to go. This trip was for our 6 month anniversary! Thanks to my BF's aunt were able to stay here and in a Presidential suite! we believe it had just opened and we were the first people to stay in the room. It was clean, modern-urban. Sliding 'barn' doors on the bathroom, cabinets. Full sized fridge. Large TVs, Bose system in the bedroom. Great big tiled shower, huge square tub in the middle of the room - the water falls from the ceiling. Toilet in its own space. Short walk to Michigan Ave. Across the street from the riverwalk.
