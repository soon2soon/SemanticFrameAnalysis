My hubby and I stayed here for the night as a generous gift from a dear friend. It's absolutely stunning, the rooms and decor are modern, the room size was adequate and the amenities are superior! Also all of the staff we've encountered have been so friendly! I would totally stay here again on my own dime without hesitation!
