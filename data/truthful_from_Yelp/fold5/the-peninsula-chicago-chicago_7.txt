Swooon - I just love this hotel!  I travel to Chicago regularly for work and have stayed at several NICE hotels in the city, but the Peninsula is in a class of it's own.  I had just a regular room and everything - I mean everything - from the moment I arrived to the moment I checked out was wonderful.   The room was beautiful, inviting and so comfortable.  The small touches from their staff takes their service to a higher level.  The service overall is attentive without being intrusive and they really do take good care of all levels of their staff. I had the most lovely conversation with the house car driver about the training they receive and it was really amazing. The hotel is really quiet too - I didn't hear any noise while I was there, which was helpful given I was there for work. No, it's not cheap, but if you have a chance and a choice - choose this hotel.  You won't regret it.  This hotel and its staff are exceptional and I only hope I will have another opportunity to be a guest here!
