It is hard to describe the Road Less Traveled or lump them into any particular category. The organization, at a passing glance, might seem like your typical summer adventure program for teenagers. However, it is so much more than that. The hard work, dedication and mission of the owners and year-round staff is second to none, and their safety record is unparalleled. Having been apart of four total RLT trips in the past, I can definitely say they were some of the most fun summers I have ever had. The expedition experience is carefully crafted to foster teamwork, respect, responsibility, and companionship. To complete an RLT trip is not merely something one does but rather something one accomplishes. Overall, a great company that is worth checking out!
