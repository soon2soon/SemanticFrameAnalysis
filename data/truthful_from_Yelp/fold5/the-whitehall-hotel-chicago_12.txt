A friend of mine got me a great deal at this wonderful hotel for my birthday. When some of us think of Michigan Ave in Chicago we automatically think its beyond our reach, but when I got this deal from my friend and actually stayed an entire weekend at this hotel, it was the best experience I have ever had. The food was great, the room was huge like an apartment. There were two baths and the bed was so comfortable that I slept through my first night there. I did not want to spoil my birthday, but I was just too comfortable. I took pictures and sent them to all my friends because I could not believe I was actually staying in such a wonderful place. The staff was ever so nice and Water Tower Place became my second home for shopping during my stay at the Whitehall. Thank you so much. You guys were the best.
