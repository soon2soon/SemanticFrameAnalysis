My husband and I were married at theWit in October 2014 and it was an amazing experience! Brittney--the senior social coordinator--made everything so easy for us and was a true pleasure to work with--especially the week of the event! I really appreciated her! Planning for the event was made simple, the space was gorgeous, the food was amazing, and the staff was great. We had about 85 guests. We opted for having the ceremony in the Dickinson, drinks/appetizers on theROOF, and the dinner/reception in Cibo Matto. TheROOF was breathtaking--even though the weather was cold, the enclosed space was the perfect backdrop to mingle with our guests and begin the celebration in style. Cibo Matto was so elegant and because of this, we didn't have to spend a lot on decorations. The room has a classic, Chicago-swank feel and overlooks bustling State Street with its picturesque windows. We decided on food stations for the reception--the surf and turf and the Mediterranean were our picks. Having delicious food was one of the most important things to my husband and we couldn't have been more pleased! Leah, the chef, customized some elements just for us, and she outdid herself! Everyone was raving about the food! The staff treated us like royalty the day of the event--getting my plate of food, attending to every little detail, and ensuring I had a cake plate in our room that evening! :) Our guests were also very impressed with the hotel location, rooms and customer service. We had a 5-star event that we will remember always! Thank you to Brittney, Leah, and theWit crew! You do amazing work!
