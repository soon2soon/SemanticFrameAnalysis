We got a great deal on this hotel from Orbitz. We were so pleased. All the staff were friendly and helpful (especially Nikki at the front desk). Rooms were standard size (small by US standards but big by NYC standards) Very comfortable and clean. Bed was so comfortable! No view but that's okay. Free coffee and flavored water in the lobby. Thin crust pizza in the restaurant was delicious! I was thrilled. Perfect location, great price. Very old school, 40s charm.
