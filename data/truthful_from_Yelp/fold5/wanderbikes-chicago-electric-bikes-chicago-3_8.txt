WanderBikes' electric bikes are so much fun to ride!!!   You ride them just like a regular bike, but the electronic assist can provide varying degrees of pedaling assistance so that you can go faster and longer without putting in so much effort. Today my boyfriend and I took the bikes out from 9:50 a.m. till 6:00 p.m.  We biked north on the Chicago lake front trail, then headed west on Lawrence to take the trail along the river, all the way up through Skokie and Wilmette to the Chicago Botanical Garden in Glencoe.  Afterwards we headed east and rode back south along the lake. Overall, we covered around 55 miles today, and thanks to the electronic assist, the only thing that feels tired is my butt, from sitting on the seat so long!  We had so much fun that we couldn't believe 8 hours had already passed! For comparison's sake, a few months ago we rode our own regular (no electric assist) bikes south along the lake front trail to Hyde Park.  Total distance covered (there and back) was only 15 miles, and we were both completely exhausted.  I felt like my legs were going to fall off, and my back was killing me!  Today with the electric bike, we rode 55 miles, and I feel great! I think electric bikes are amazing, and WanderBikes is wonderful!  They offer good rental rates and tours, and they provide you with bike locks, maps, helmets, and bags that can be attached to the bike to store your belongings, all at no extra charge.  The two staff members we interacted with today were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the bikes and different bike paths.   I highly recommend WanderBikes!  Even though I have my own regular bike, I would definitely rent an electric bike from them again!  :)  I plan to take my sister and dad on an electric bike ride next year when they are in town!
