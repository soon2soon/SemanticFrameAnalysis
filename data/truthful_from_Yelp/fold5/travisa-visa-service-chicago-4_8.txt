I needed a Chinese visa quickly and was completely satisfied with Travisa's service. I'm in Kansas City and I sent my passport on Saturday afternoon via Fed Ex's standard service to Travisa in Chicago. I had my passport with Visa back in my hands on Tuesday. Â Our local AAA office uses their service and gave me the recommendation. I couldn't have been happier. Bill in K.C.
