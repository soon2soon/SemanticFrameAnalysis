Beautiful rooms with Salvatore Ferragamo soaps in the bathroom. Suites have a working fireplace in the room and all rooms have a full bathtub and separate standing shower. Guests have access to the spa lounge, sauna, steam room, and whirlpool-- one of the top spas in the country. Gym is beautiful and kept up, Balsan restaurant is very upscale. Best hotel I've stayed at in Chicago!
