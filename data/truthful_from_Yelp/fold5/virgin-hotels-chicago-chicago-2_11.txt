Damn it Anthony M. I thought I had the first review. :) Anyway, so ended up here on a Saturday night where we bar hopping celebrate my bday. The place is freaking awesome. it reminds me of an upscale version of the Geekbar. Décor upscale yet welcoming. There  plenty of comfy couches and seats and if you're in the mood to play a board game you can grab one of the tables. There are comic books stacked up and there was a group people were having a blast playing Jenga. The reserves are very friendly. We put in our drink orders and since they heard it's my bday until we got our drinks they offered me complimentary champagne. They were not hovering but stopped by a few times to see if we needed anything and knew exactly when we were ready for the next ground. They had some pretty good drinks $13 bucks a piece. I had a couple of bittersweets. Those were pretty good. Had a pretty decent bar menu but we didn't try the food there. But next time for sure. Given that I live only a few blocks away definitely plan on frequenting this place. Welcome to Chicago Mr. Branson. If you can keep this up , you're the man. :)
