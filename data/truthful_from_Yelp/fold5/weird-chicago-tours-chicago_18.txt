I bought tickets for the Sex and the Supernatural Tour to celebrate a birthday. We had a wonderful time! Sunny, our tourguide, is an amazing storyteller and we visited some really cool places in Chicago that were haunted: site of the Eastland Disaster, Death Alley in the Loop, and on the sexy side we had a special tour and discussion at Skyscraper Heels on Belmont Ave. There were some other fun places we went to as well. It was the perfect way to start a fun and spooky birthday weekend and I would totally recommend any of their tours to tourists and residents alike. Â We had a lot of fun!!!!!!!!!!!
