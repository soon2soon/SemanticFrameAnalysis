I have stayed at theWit multiple times and with each stay I am reminded of how much I love this hotel. Annie, the Front Office Manager, is so kind and always greets me with a smile and the offer of a warm chocolate chip cookie. The rooms are lovely, with their bright jewel toned colors, specious layout, and premium bedding. I have never had a room without a beautiful view; maybe I have just been spoiled! The rooms are always immaculate and housekeeping is efficient yet courteous. I have been to Roof and State and Lake a few times and love that guests get access to these fantastic restaurants. If you are dining at State and Lake ask for the manager, Linh. He is so helpful with choosing just the right wine for any occasion. If you are planning a special event or function, check out the space where Cibo Matto used to be, it's gorgeous and very spacious. All in all, I absolutely love theWit and would suggest it to anyone and everyone visiting Chicago.
