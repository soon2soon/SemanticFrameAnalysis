Ahoy! One of my favorite things from when I lived in Chicago was the view from the bridges over the river. The buildings are so beautiful and the sparkle on the water makes you forget that it's actually filled with sewage. You might not want to go swimming but it sure is purdy. Since I love this spot it was a lock that I would love these boat tours. Being right in the thick of that view for 90 minutes with some great coworkers at night? Yes please. The boat is nice and roomy and it wasn't terribly crowded on a Wednesday night. Two levels--the top is the place to get some sea air and do your best Titanic impression ("king of the world" and all that). Downstairs there is a bar (yesssssss) and "indoor" seating which is nice if you're chilly (but the view isn't quite as good thanks to the bright overhead lights). The tour guide had a memorized script, of course, but it had bits of humor and interesting nuggets of trivia that had me saying "well, I'll be!" multiple times. The boat does a run southwest on the river then turns around and heads northeast out to Lake Michigan where it does a few passes giving you a beautiful view of the skyline and Navy Pier for a good 45 minutes or so before heading back. It's definitely a touristy type of excursion but one that is worth doing, whether you're a local or just hanging for the day.
