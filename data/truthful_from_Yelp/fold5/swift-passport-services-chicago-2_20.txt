I waited till the last minute that I needed to fly back to the UK, even despite a screw up at USPS, Peter and his colleagues took care of my passport in ONE business day. I literally, got the amended documents back to their office, and end of next business day received an e-mail with a scan showing my spankin' new passport. Everyone at Swift is very kind, helpful and funny -- this truly is the only time in my entire life I have enjoyed applying for a government document. Thanks again Swift!
