Had a very nice stay here. It is off the beaten path and have to catch taxi to get to anywhere (don't know bus system) in which it only takes a few minutes to get you there. Enjoyed the staff. Didn't have any problems when I called to inquire about the room charge from the restaurant, they said it would be removed. But I don't understand how you can get something charged to your room from the restaurant without showing ID???? I didn't even step foot in there and was charged $4 ....for coffee they said. Anyway, I would stay here again because the beds were comfortable, very clean room & of course across the street from a wonderful grocery store. I do wish they had mini fridges in rooms though...along with microwave in central area.
