Great food. Great history about iconic Chicago eateries. I thoroughly enjoyed walking through downtown Chicago and visiting the famous location and hearing g the stories behind the tasty treats. My favorites were the Palmer House brownie and the Chicago dog. Take one of these tours. It's definitely worth your $$ and time.
