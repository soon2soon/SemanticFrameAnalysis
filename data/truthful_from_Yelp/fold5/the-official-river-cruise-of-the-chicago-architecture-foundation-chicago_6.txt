This is an absolutely fantastic way to hear some of the history of the city, as well as see some really cool architecture from the river. I absolutely LOVED the sunset tour I went on and felt that it was totally worth the money. It's a must-do for first-timers in Chicago! I also would definitely recommend doing a sunset tour (book a tour for as close to sunset as possible) so that you can see the city transition from day to night. It's gorgeous, watching the city lights come on as you sail along the banks. And the buildings look so different too that I felt as though I were getting two different experiences at the same time! Our docent/tour guide (they're all volunteers -- isn't that amazing?) was very knowledgeable and was super cute about doing our tour since it was the first time that he had ever done a sunset/night tour himself. It was adorable to see him lose his train of thought because, as he said, he kept being blown away by how the city twinkled at night. It was amazing. You don't even have to know anything about architecture to enjoy this tour (and if you do know stuff, you might be even more fascinated). Our guide kept it to laymen's terms so that everyone could understand and enjoy the program. And definitely bring a camera -- the views and photos can't be beat! Seriously, what a fantastic tour. I'd recommend it to anyone who goes to Chicago (for the first time, or on a return visit)!
