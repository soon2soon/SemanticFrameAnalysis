What a great location and beautiful hotel. The rooms were spacious and very clean. We used the Westin for our hotel wedding block overall we had 15 rooms booked with them. Stephanie helped us the whole way. She was so kind and helpful. Â For my bridal suite I booked the celebrity suite it was amazing and compared to some other hotels it was very reasonably priced. I could not have asked for anything better. We also hosted a brunch there for the hotel guests on Sunday and Avery thing was delicious. If you are getting married in the city and are looking for a hotel I would strongly suggest Stephanie and the Westin River
