Jay was excellent. In planning a multi-destination trip to europe, I shopped for the plane tickets on price-line, expedia, orbitz, cheaptickets and kayak. He was able to beat the best that I could find there by over 50%. If you have any sort of a complex trip planned, you likely can save time and money by using a travel agent. They do have sites and tools not available to consumers. Check with Jay at Sunset.
