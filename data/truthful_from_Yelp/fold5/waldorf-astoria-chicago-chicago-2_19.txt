What a swanky hotel!  Quite possibly one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at and now understand why it's highly ranked as one of the best city hotels in the nation.  The rooms were wonderful!  Stayed in the luxury suite (pretty spectacular) and also the king superior room.  They have all the great amenities you'd expect from a luxury hotel (including a full floor spa, fitness center, sauna, pool!).  If you're looking for a mini getaway weekend or just want to feel like a celebrity, this place is worth the money stars.
