Amtrak put me up here for the night, after a missed connection.  I didn't know what to expect, but was very happy with the accomodations. The room was very clean and neat and stylish, the whole hotel had an unusual and pleasant ambience to it.  And I got a good night's rest.  And a nice bath in  avery large tub.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here.
