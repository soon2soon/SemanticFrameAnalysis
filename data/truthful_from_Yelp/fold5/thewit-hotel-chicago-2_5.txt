I want to begin with WOW! This amazingly cute, chic hotel ensures the "little touches". My adorable room was complete with a chandler and fully stocked mini bar. They thought of everything, including a "love box" (something I chuckled). As you walk the hallways, there is no semblance of "The shinning". The walls are brightly colored with quotes of some very famous people. You can hear birds or sounds of the harbor from the speakers as you walk to the elevator. It is centrally located downtown and the staff was incredibly helpful.
