I hired Top Fleet yesterday for a ride home from ORD to the city after a business trip and I was super impressed with the service. I was a little concerned about how it would end up because my flight was 30 min late and then it took forever for our bags to even come up at baggage claim. I had asked for a 4:45 pick up and I didn't even have my bags til 5:40, so I was wondering how the driver would handle this. I was totally impressed with the driver, the car and his service. He was very polite and professional and the car was in immaculate condition. Most of all, I was thankful that he was there still waiting for me at my pick up spot, despite the fact that I was so late. He was very respectful as well, asking me how my flight was, if there was anything I needed etc. I will definitely continue to use this fleet company! thank you top fleet!
