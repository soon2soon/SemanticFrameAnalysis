We just departed this wonderful ship and I'm sad that we had to leave. Crew member Michelle and Pirate Dave made our experience a great one!! It's true that you don't go past the breakwater, but it's a worthwhile trip nonetheless. They give you an option to hoist the sails (multiple people),  ring the bell (one person), and fire a cannon (a child). There's a head (bathroom) and a reasonably priced bar on board. We are out-of-staters but if we ever do visit the Navy Pier again,  I would definitely choose to do this cruise again over any of the other many options to choose from. Thank you Tall Windy Ship for giving us a cruise that we'll remember for a lifetime!
