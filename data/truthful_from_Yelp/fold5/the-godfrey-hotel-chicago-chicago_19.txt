I can see how this hotel gets bad reviews from people who are in town for business or looking for a relaxing vacation. Yes it is loud. But it is located in a great area, rooftop bar/ restaurant is great, good music, great drinks and amazing views. I love the decor. very modern and clean. We stayed there one night and been to the restaurants couple of times and loved it. So if you are in town to party and have fun, this is a great hotel!
