I cannot praise the TikiBoat enough. Captain MarK - with a capital K because he kicks ass - was awesome. I reserved the boat from 8 to 11pm to watch the fireworks and have a "No longer a bacheloretter, party" for my friend. I was very concerned the weather would not cooperate but Captain Mark kept in touch with me all day to tell me about the conditions. Luckily, the skies cleared and we had a blast on the boat. Dancing, tiki drinks, fireworks, what more could you ask for? A squall did come in at the very end of our trip and Captain Mark and his first mate, also a Mark/Marc, told us exactly what to do and they were great navigating through the winds and rain. I HIGHLY recommend the boat and can't wait to go back. Some things to know: There is a bathroom. They have a large cooler on board and they can supply ice. There is ample room for 12 people on the boat. We never felt crowded. There is a grill; however, we did not use it. They accept credit cards and don't forget to tip! You can hook up your phone or iPod to their sound system The boat was very clean.
