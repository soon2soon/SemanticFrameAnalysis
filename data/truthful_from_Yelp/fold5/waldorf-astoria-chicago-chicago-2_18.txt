This is my second stay at the Waldorf and I've really enjoyed it both times. Service here is really impeccable. The one odd little hiccup was that when I arrived the sofa in the living room was completely unfolded out into a bed, coffee table pushed aside and I couldn't wrestle the damn thing back into a sofa. the valet was very nice though and helped with that. He thought it was odd too. some of the room service ladies wear way too much perfume. I ordered breakfast and my entire room smelled like the perfume counter at macys which I really couldn't Â handle. The rooms are beautifully appointed with fantastic showers. Remember the episode of Seinfeld, when Kramer decides to change out the shower head from Low-Flow to the Elephant Wash Showerhead and it blasts him out of the shower? That's what they have here and it's just fantastic and ya never want to get out. Free Wifi, courtesy car service which I was able to partake of twice. Really great sound system that you can pop your iPhone into and enjoy. Bernard's the mezzanine cocktail lounge all just great. It's a special and wonderful experience staying at the Waldorf. I highly recommend.
