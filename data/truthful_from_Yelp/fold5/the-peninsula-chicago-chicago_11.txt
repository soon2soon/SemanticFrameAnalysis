Afternoon Tea Â  So well done, and so beautifully served. The tea sandwiches were as tasty as they were pretty. We opted to include the rose champagne to our tea. Not a cheap meal I am guessing about $75 a person with two glasses of champagne. It was more food than we could devour at that time of day so we had them pack it up for home. The lemon curd was a treat served with the tractional clotted cream and jam with the scones.
