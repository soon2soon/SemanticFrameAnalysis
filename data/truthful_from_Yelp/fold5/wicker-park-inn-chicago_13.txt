Our stay in the three bedroom apartment (across the street from the B+B AND the train noise) was lovely! The guests checking out the night before were leaving a little later than allowed and our hostess was most accommodating. The beds weren't out of this world --but they were fine. We finished a long night of bachelorette celebrations (Violet Hour and Danny's ...both very close) here. Since our room did not include food (there's a kitchen in the apartment), Wicker Park Inn has a perfect location for a wide variety of brunch the next morning (Bongo Room, Milk + Honey), too.
