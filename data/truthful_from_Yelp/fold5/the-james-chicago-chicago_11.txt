My girlfriend and I stayed here on the weekend of 3/7. Definitely the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The doormen and the concierge are very friendly and accommodating. Hotel itself is very clean and are kept at high standards. I think we had just a standard room, but the amenities of it were very nice. Robes were waiting for us in the bathroom, and I found that the shampoo/conditioner/body wash were very nice...similar to a 'tea tree' feel. There was a lounge area with a tv, another 'nook' with a lounge bed that had a projector that we could watch tv from, as well as a very comfortable king size bed. The complimentary jug of water, electric kettle (for coffee and tea), and other little things were very nice touches. Also, since my girlfriend was sick most of the weekend, we spent a lot of time in the room. While she slept, I drank my scotchy scotch and the hotel was very prompt in sending buckets of ice up to the room :) I would definitely stay here again.
