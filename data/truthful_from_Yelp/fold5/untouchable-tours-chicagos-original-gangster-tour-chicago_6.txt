Just went this afternoon for the 1:00 tour and had such an awesome time! Our guides were Shoulders and Knuckles..who were super informative and funny! Learned so much about Prohibition in Chicago and got to travel a lot of parts of the city we would've ignored otherwise. Beautiful city with great history..definitely a must tour! Thanks guys!
