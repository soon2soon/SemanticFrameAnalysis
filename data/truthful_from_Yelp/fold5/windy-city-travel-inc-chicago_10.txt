Kathy Allinson at Windy City Travel. In a word: Awesome. Called her with a sketched out trip agenda to Italy for my family (including two middle-school-aged sons) and she hit the itinerary out of the coliseum. Every facet of the trip, from rail tickets, to rental car, to hotel selection, to private guides in Rome, Pompeii and Venice, to transport went off without a single hitch. She also had great ideas that I would never have thought of - Like Gladiator school for the boys prior to our excursion to the Roman ruins. Fun clashes with history! Kathy is easy to work and knew the country and a family's objectives exceptionally well. If she wasn't for certain, she went the extra mile to find out. 14 days in Italy is a risky venture for a family of four. A million things can go wrong. Thanks to Kathy's efforts, our number was zero. Okay, maybe one - she didn't warn us to talk our kids out of McDonald's next to Pisa. Worst Big Mac ever! Grazie, Kathy, for everything. It was the trip of a lifetime thanks to you - Five stars! I'd work with her again in a heartbeat. Assuming my heart keeps working after 37 servings of spaghetti carbonara.
