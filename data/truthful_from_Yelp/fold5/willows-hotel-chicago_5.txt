We were visiting family in Chicago and chose The Willows because of its location in Lake View. From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming. Our room was large and felt very modern, as if it had been newly renovated. The pillows were the most comfortable I have ever had at a hotel, and I got a great night's sleep in their beds. The wifi was a little shaky at times but overall worked well, and the in-room internet access through the television was something I have never experienced before. It was great to use for researching attractions, events, and places to eat in the city. The continental breakfast each morning was excellent, with just about any breakfast food you could think of being offered. Overall though, what makes The Willows a wonderful place is its staff. They do whatever it takes to make sure their guests were having all their needs met and are comfortable. This includes them personally offering to deliver ice to our room when we didn't know where the machine was, as well as each staff member giving their own personal recommendations on their favorite places to eat in the neighborhood. Every time we left the building, the front desk staff would say "Enjoy your day!" When we would return at night it was "Welcome back, how was your day?" Even when getting breakfast downstairs each day it was, "Good morning. How did you sleep?" These are the little things that make guests feel welcome and cared for, and I cannot stress enough how much it meant to us. Staying at The Willows fully enriched my visit to the city and I will be booking here exclusively for all my future travels to Chicago. I would give The Willows 10 stars if I could.
