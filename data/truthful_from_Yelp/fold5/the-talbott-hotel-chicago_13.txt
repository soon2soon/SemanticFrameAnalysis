Stay here. I've been to my share of hotels (yeah that sounds slutty) and this is above average for the price. From exiting the cab to checking in etc, the staff was beyond nice. The decor is Ralph Lauren-esque; very woodsy equestrian with fireplaces in the lobby. There's a modern bar smack in the middle which is a bit odd. Rooms are spacious and clean... includes a Mac mini to use, free wifi, Keurig coffee machine, Molten Brown toiletries and most importantly the showers are lava hot. I love me a good hot shower although my skin begs to differ. Towels are fluffy and the Fannie May chocolate on the pillow is a nice touch. Literally steps away from Michigan Ave. The only negative if you call it that, is that the American Girl doll at the check-in desk creeps me out. Seriously, why? We're still here and I'm writing this now or else I'll forget. They deserve the accolades. Good job Talbott Hotel!
