I never been here, but here is some booking advice that might help people get a room they like....I know nothing about the basic rooms, but... The Riverview Spa Rooms are at the corner of the building that faces Marina City and the river. All these rooms have separate showers and extra large soaking tubs. They are the most romantic of the basic rooms and they cost more because of the super bathroom and the awesome view. The "regular" Spa Room, has the same bathroom setup as the Riverview room, but looks onto the Chicago Theatre and the State/Lake area. These rooms can be noisy because of the train, but the bathrooms also have giant floor to ceiling windows giving an interesting/fun view onto the city. The "lakeview" spa room has the largest bathroom, but a combination tub/shower. The hotel admits that the view is not very spectacular and this is the least "romantic" of the spa rooms. They are the least expensive of the spa rooms.
