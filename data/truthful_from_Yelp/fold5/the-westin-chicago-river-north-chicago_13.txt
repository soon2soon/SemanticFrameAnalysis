If you're looking for a hotel in the heart of it all, this is the place to be. Having never stayed in the city before, we knew we wanted to be in the middle of everything.  Located right across the street from House of Blues, Harry Caray's and other establishments on Dearborn, this is the place to call home. The staff was extremely friendly and worked with us every step of the way.  If you need anything, they made sure that it was supplied.  The concierge was ready to direct you in the way of your destination and was sure to give you suggestions on where to head. The room was spacious.  Be sure to request a room that over looks the river.  Our views were amazing.  We had requested a early check in and were granted that as well. Westin promotes their Westin Workout and each Westin has a top notch workout room equipped for the person ready to hit the gym.  We partook in this a few times on our stay and it refreshed us for the day on the town. Only downside was that the restaurants on property weren't rated very high so we passed on those in favor of other Chicago establishments. On our check out day, the hotel was accommodating in holding our bags for us until our train left so we could continue on with our trek around the city. I will definitely make this my home on my future trips.
