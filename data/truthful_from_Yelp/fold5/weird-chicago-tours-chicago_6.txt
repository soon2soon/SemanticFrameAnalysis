This is an awesome way to spend a weekend, whether you are in Chicago as a tourist or a native. The hosts are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and highly entertaining. You should visit their website for times and options. They do tours on a variety of topics including Chicago gangsters, Red Light District, Hauntings/Ghosts, 1893 World's Expo, and more. This is a great option whether you're looking for something different to do on a date or treating a large group to something special.
