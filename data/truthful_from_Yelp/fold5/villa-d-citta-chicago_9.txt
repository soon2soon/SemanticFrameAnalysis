This place is lovely.  I stayed during the crazy snow storm in January and even though I was stuck in Chicago longer than I had hoped, it was a perfect place to be snowed in.  They upgraded me to the master suite, which is perfect for a romantic weekend with a fireplace, jacuzzi tub, balcony and beautiful four poster bed.  The service was great and the room was a dream.
