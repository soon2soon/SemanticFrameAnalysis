This was something i was really looking forward to it. I told my girlfriend and she wanted to check it out as well. Its 25.00 for a 2 hour tour in a black school bus and its air conditioned. I know your probably thinking this is weird,but believe me it was one of the more fun things we did when we were there. The tour guide big julie & shoulders showed us around all over Chicago. They explain all the different gangsters in Chicago area and talk a lot about al capone and his lifestyle.They are also very funny and they have fun doing there job,which means a lot.You meet at the rock & roll McDonalds and take off from there. You can pay at the bus but its recommended paying over the phone and making reservations.We enjoyed this very much and if your in Chicago this is a must to learn more about prohibition & gangsters back in the days.
