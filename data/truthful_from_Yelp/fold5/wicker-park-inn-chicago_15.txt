Honestly, I don't know where to start from... It does NOT get any better than this in hospitality industry, period! I travel a lot and I do know what it means to come back home after week of travelling the country..... I would never trade my bed for any of the hotels' I ve stayed in, and believe me, I ve seen some nice ones..... Until now. This place makes me feel not wanting to come back home. I don't want to leave! We booked somewhat reluctantly, based on a simple recomendation of a nearby full hotel... And what a blessing! Robin from the staff made us feel at home as soon as she run across the street to hang us the parking permits. We happen to occupy the Bucktown apartment and enjoyed the lavish, yet so stylish settings of a modern urban condo. The area reminded me of a quiet Bostonian Back Bay side street, yet it had something more to it... There are at least fifteen local restaurants within walking distance, choices are fantastic. From immaculate cleanness, through the soft and comfortable bedding, sparkling glass bath, fully equipped kitchen, to the Diego Riveira's prints on walls.... everything was quietly making me feel ... complete. I will, for the best of my knowledge, always stay at Wicker Park Inn, everytime I come to Chicago, even if it means sitting hours in traffic to cross the city to my job-related point....
