I do realize that it's a little silly to leave yet another 5 star review for this tour, but I just have to after our tour. My mom, a lifelong Cubs fan, came to visit for the weekend. I took her to a game on Saturday and to the Cubs tour on Sunday. She enjoyed the game (we were there for the Cub's 4000th win!) but the tour far surpassed our expectations. I dont want to give away too much about what we saw and what we learned, but I was thoroughly impressed. I had no idea how different things used to be and the many, many ways Wrigley Field has evolved in the past century. And I'm not usually someone that is into learning about the history of things, how things used to be, etc etc. The tour guide was amazing. Very personable.. kept things on schedule and it was obvious she was a lifelong Cubs fan and knew everything there was to know about the Cubs history!. The tour takes you into the press box, you sit in some seats in the 400 level, past the batting cages, onto the field by the dugouts and in the bleachers. Someone in our group even proposed to his girlfriend on the field! Talk about memorable.. I recommend this tour for everyone, even if you're not a huge Cubs fan. A couple things to note -- there is a lot of fast paced walking. I would love to bring my Grandpa to this, but it just isn't possible. If you can, go on a game day and get the last tour offered. We were able to actually see a lot of players warm up on the field and in the batting cages. It's hard to beat that.
