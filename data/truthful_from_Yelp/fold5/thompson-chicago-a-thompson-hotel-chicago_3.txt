I stayed here the day before my wedding and on my wedding night. I had a room block for my out of town guests, as well, and everyone was so thrilled and couldn't say enough good things. Annarita is the one who helped me coordinate everything. She responded to all my questions almost instantly, and she truly made my experience incredible. The hotel itself is in a great location--tons of bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. The decor inside the lobby is modern and chic. The rooms are comfortable yet stylish. I stayed on the Pent House floor, and I NEVER wanted to leave. My room was spacious and unique. My view was breathtaking. I can't really even find all the right adjectives to describe how I feel about the Thompson Hotel and how I feel about my experiences with every staff interaction. I felt so special from the second I arrived, and I could not recommend this place more! I definitely plan on taking many more "Staycations" to this hotel to celebrate each anniversary and special occasion in my life!
