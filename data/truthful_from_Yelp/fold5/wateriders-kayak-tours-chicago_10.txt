Bought 2 Groupons for kayak tour. The website accepted one voucher but not the other. I don't know if this was an issue with Groupon or the Wateriders website. Regardless, the owner made it right and when my daughter and her friends arrived for the tour there were no issues. They had a great time and Wateriders was very accommodating. Quick reply by email. Will buy more in the future for sure.
