There are several reasons why I choose the Tall Ship Windy as one of my can't-miss Chi-town destinations: 1) several different tours (historical [i.e. [pirates, lives of sailors], architectural, and "whale watching" (if you need to ask about whales in the Great Lakes we need to tawk); 2) adventurous crew (aye, matey get the idea?); 3) wonderful for all ages; 4) the only chance to be on the water in a real Tall Ship in Chicago outside of occasional interlopers; 5) food and drink are available on board; and 6) what the heck else would land-locked Midwesterners want to do for a couple hours that could be this? OK, I digress.  I've sailed with this family owned and operated crew before and like the postal service (used to be) nothing can stop these folks.   Except the captain, the crew are dressed in pirate costumes and play the parts with vigor.  They engage folks who want a hands-on experience to help raise the sails, they ensure that everyone becomes involved in the experience, and foremost assure that everyone understands nautical safety.   Hanging out in the cooling breezes a mile offshore is one of the respites amidst the cacophony of the city gives a soothing downtime for travelers from near and from far.   Note:  wear sunscreen even when you think there are no UV rays, bring sunglasses and deck-worthy shoes so you do not succumb to earthly distractions while enjoying our little ocean called Lake Michigan.   Joy to the world, all the boys and girls, joy to the fishies........
