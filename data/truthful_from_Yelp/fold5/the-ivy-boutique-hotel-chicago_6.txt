I stayed at the Ivy for my 30th birthday in January. Let me first start by saying if you visit Chicago or just want to get away for the weekend choose " The Ivy ". All of the staff were pleasant and helpful. I stayed in the King Suite and I was gorgeous and very comfortable. I wanted to take the bed with me so awesome and the rain shower is to die for. You can have a party in the tub!!! The television in mirror was a great touch!! I loved the huge windows and view. The hotel has these cute packages for your room in case you're having a romantic getaway!! The Ivy left little gifts of red velvet cake pops on the bed after cleaning room thanking us for stay... Nice warm touch. Overall excellent experience and I can't wait until the summer time to visit the rooftop lounge!!! I'll be back :-)
