My daughter recently had her Sweet 16 party aboard the Tiki Boat, and we had a wonderful experience!!   Pablo, the owner, is a great guy and is very friendly and flexible.  Our captain, William, was a laid back and personable guy who handled our group of teenage girls like a pro!  Despite rain ... spells of DOWNPOURING rain (and even some passing thunder showers), we all had a blast aboard the Tiki Boat!!  When it did rain, we were all able to fit under the covered area... a little squishy, but we did fit!  We brought our own food and music on board, and the kids danced, swam, and slid (on the amazingly fun and fast 2 story slide) for 3 glorious hours.  They even had some floaties that the kids used to hang out on while bobbing around in the Play Pen.  I would VERY highly recommend everyone renting the Tiki Boat for any occasion... I know I'd like to use it for MY birthday next time!  ( :
