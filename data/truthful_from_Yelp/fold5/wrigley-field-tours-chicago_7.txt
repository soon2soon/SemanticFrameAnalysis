The Cubs were out of town so we decided to take a tour of the field and it was amazing!! It was a little spendy ($30) for the tour but all the informative tidbits by the tour guide and behind the scenes access made it worth it. I would highly recommend for any baseball fan. You will not regret it! A memory that I will never forget.
