Me and four friends booked the TikiBoat for a bachelor party daytime activity, and it was the most fun we had all weekend.  Capt. Steve manned the ship and took us around Navy Pier and out to the party cove spot.  He is a great captain and kept the entire party safe and provided great recommendations on where to go.  The boat is spacious and can easily fit 12 or more people. It has a water slide so what more could you possibly want?  Had a great time and I will definitely be doing this again.
