What a fantastic experience. I planned my stay with Hotels.com, and was excited to try a new property in Chicago. I was really thrilled to find the quirks of the Virgin brand peppered throughout this hotel concept - from the decor to the customer service. The room was incredible. It's not big - but I wouldn't expect that of a big city hotel room anyways. It's cozy, but it's also luxe. I had a king chamber with a large king bed, cool view, and loads of amenities. I was impressed with the fact that the treats in the room were all really reasonably priced (all under $5 for the most part), and they had some cheekier amenities like racy playing cards which might be fun or funny for a romantic trip. The bed was super cool - with a corner cushion on the foot of the bed if you're having a conversation and want to face each other comfortably. There was also a really great little vanity in the dressing room part of the chamber, which was practical for putting on a morning face. I had dinner and breakfast at the hotel, and those experiences were great, too. The dinner menu was really quite eclectic. We started with a cheese plate and some cocktails, and then I had the vegetarian (vegan, actually I think) paella which was outstanding. I wanted to eat it again after finishing my meal. My colleague also had some dessert which looked really delicious. For breakfast, I had an egg white omelet and it was probably the best, fluffiest egg white omelet I've ever had. The spinach was fresh, the tomatoes were perfectly seasoned. The eggs are served with a vegetable hash of root veg like potatoes, carrots, etc. There was a fresh blueberry compote for a jam on the toast, and I also ordered a fruit plate that for $4 was super fresh, sweet, and versatile. I'd love to stay here again, and will absolutely recommend it to any friends or colleagues headed to the Windy City.
