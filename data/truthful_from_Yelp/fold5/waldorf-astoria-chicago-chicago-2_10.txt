How a hotel should be! The room was impeccable and service was outstanding. For example, when I came to check in at about 4pm after hours and hours of delays at the Newark airport, my room wasn't quite ready. But instead of just apologizing, the front desk -- unprompted -- offered to bought me food and a drink at the bar while I waited for my room to be ready (which occurred about 10 minutes after I sat down). Granted, them comping food and drinks might not (in and of itself) seem like some grand gesture, but when they do it on their own volition and not as a result of complaining or some parade of horribles, it's impressive to me. Centrally located, this hotel is right near Michigan avenue, a bunch of restaurants and shops (Starbucks, LuLuLemon, Bloomingdales, Deepdish pizza joints, etc) and is definitely a great place to stay if you're visiting the Chi.
