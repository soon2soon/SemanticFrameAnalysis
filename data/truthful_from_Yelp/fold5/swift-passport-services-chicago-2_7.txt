I'd never needed to expedite a passport before and I was a little nervous about leaving my documents with someone. What a GREAT experience I had with Swift Passport Services.  They were knowledgeable, helpful and communicated amazingly well during the entire process.  Their email communication system is only surpassed by their personal emails to me to confirm the information!  In addition, when the overnight delivery service was delayed due to bad weather across the country, Swift offered to go to FedEx and change the delivery method for quicker delivery if I needed it! They were great to work with - highly recommend them!
