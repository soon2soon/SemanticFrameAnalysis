I purchased tickets for Tastebud Tours (Flavors) as an anniversary present for my boyfriend. I was so excited with the idea of a food tour that I invited another couple to join us. I can't say enough- we had the greatest time! Our group was a decent size, about 14 people, and our tour guides were fantastic (Anna Lynn and the owner) They were very knowledgeable about the restaurants, food, Chicago history, etc. Also, each stop on the tour was prepared for our group, we had preferred seating, and no wait. Price: VERY reasonable. Huge portions for the price, plus water at each stop. Favorite Stop: Pizanos (delicious! My new favorite Chicago pizza place! .. we were served two pieces of pizza and even sat in the "celebrity room". Service was stellar, and very accommodating) I'll admit it, there is a lot of walking so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. In all actuality, the walking is really nice so you don't get that Thanksgiving-Food-Coma-Feeling. I definitely recommend taking the tour- especially when the weather is nice. Make sure to book early so you can choose the day/time you'd like.
