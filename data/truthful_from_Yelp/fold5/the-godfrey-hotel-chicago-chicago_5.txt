Lounge/restaurant Great place for rooftop brunch and night views! Everyone's friendly and prices are not bad at all. Â Perfect for birthdays, $200 bottle champs and 9 small dishes to choose from. Loved it, friendly staff, great drinks! Recommended! Will be back. TIP: come early weekends, lots of people try to get in, big lines.
