What makes tea here so special? That is an easy one word answer. EVERYTHING! This was a great afternoon tea experience.  The place is very contemporary and spacious unlike some of the others. It also gets a lot of light which I see as a huge plus.....We were seated in an area with a sofa and two chairs, which made for a very relaxing tea time. While we were seated away from the huge floor to ceiling windows, we still had a pretty good view. Directly in front of us was a fireplace which served no purpose on this beautiful day. But it was pretty to look at. What I found to be unique is that our tea did not require filtering.  Without the need to filter, things were effortless.  But, in all honesty, it was effortless anyway. Our server returned frequently to pour us each more tea. The only thing he did  not offer to do was hold the cup as we sipped. I am serious! The guy was on it. Our courses were brought out one at a time which was a little different. Also, our tea stands were on the floor as opposed to on the table. By the third course (dessert), I was full and the sofa made dozing off very tempting. However, the sight of the hot, soft scones compelled me to finish the course. Plan to spend at least an hour and a half or two hours here. Other nice touches- There was an employee who pressed the down elevator button upon our departure and accompanied us downstairs. How's that for service?!!!
