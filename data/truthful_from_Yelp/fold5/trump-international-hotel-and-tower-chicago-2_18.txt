Heaven, indeed. Spa suite upgrade. TV in the mirror in the washroom vanity. Classical music upon entering room. Wellness weights. Yoga mat. Yoga block & DVDs. Nature sound CDs. Aromatherapy Pillow Service via Pillow Menu. Mood lighting - all on dimmers. Master switch with these modes: All on (afternoon, evening, night light) All off Buttons to close black out shades Relaxing, subtle smelling toiletries White Spa Robes & slippers. Fully stocked snack bar (with good [dangerous] options). Nespresso coffee machine & Hot Water Pot for Tea. Champagne, peach & gray color palette. In-room white orchid. Curtains that close with the push of a button. Wake-up calls by a real, live person (!!!). Only downside is that the bed leaves room for improvement: mattress sunk in a bit and could have been more firm. Missing bottom sheet. (Like many hotels, they sloppily tucked in a top loose sheet as a pretend fitted sheet.) If everything else weren't so amazing and above par, I'd knock off a star for this. Service was exceptional. Was able to get free bottles of water at the reception desk, upon request. Note: I stay at hotels weekly for work, over 100 days per year.
