My husband I and pulled the trigger on a warm weather getaway with about a month lead time...we needed some professional help getting the travel arranged! I called Windy City Travel after they popped up on a quick Google search. Kathy was "assigned" to help us plan out trip and she couldn't have been more helpful. She was quick to respond to emails and return phonecalls (which was much appreciated due the lack of time we had in planning!). Kathy recommended several destinations and made sure our request to stay at or under budget didn't get dismissed. Overall, it was mission accomplished...we had sun, ocean, pool and cocktails for a reasonable price. She even went out of her way to reserve us seats on a booked leg of our travel, and made sure she walked us through our arrival into Jamaica and the logistics of getting to and from our hotel. Two thumbs up for Kathy at Windy City!
