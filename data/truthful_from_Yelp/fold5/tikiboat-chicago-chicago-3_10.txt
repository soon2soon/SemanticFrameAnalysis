TikiBoat Chicago is the best boat charter in Chicago! Monroe Harbor is very easy to get to as you can just walk east from the Monroe red line.The owner, Pablo is the most friendly and personable person you will ever meet and his captains are the BEST! It's no wonder that there are so many others that try to copy this establishment. You can bring your ipod to blast your own jams as you relish the views of the skyline from the lake point of view. Bring food to grill and drinks to party and you will have an absolutely amazing time. Make sure to tell Pablo that April says "Hello". And keep up the great work, you guys!!!
