I don't know that I can fully express my gratitude for the Talbott and the service they provided to me this past weekend. I spent the past few months planning my proposal to my girlfriend and spent a lot of time researching hotels, restaurants, parks, events, theatres, etc. This did not come without crazy stress. I booked the Talbott based solely on the Yelp reviews and did not contact the hotel until a few weeks before our stay. As soon as I spilled I would be spending my engagement night with them, they immediately connected me with Tim, the concierge, and loaded me with helpful information. If I could do my proposal all over (I am not from Chicago), I would have booked the Talbott first, then called to talk about restaurants, locations, fancy parks, romantic settings, etc. They are incredibly friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable in a straight forward, no BS sort of way. They do their job, and they do it well. I had reservations at Joe's, the Chicago Cut, Gibson's, and Bavette's. In a five minute conversation, I was able to pick exactly which restaurant I wanted (not easy to do with those steakhouses). Further, they set up for my cousin to drop off our baggage, arranged roses to be delivered, carriage rides to dinner, rose petal turn down service, and offered champagne, in-room massages, upgrades and anything else my mind could have fathomed. The location was prime. The service was unparalleled. The amenities were extravagant, yet tasteful. True class. I can promise I will be staying in the Talbott in the future. Guys, if you want to wow your special someone, book the Talbott, then call the concierge. I repeat, book the Talbott ... then call the concierge.
