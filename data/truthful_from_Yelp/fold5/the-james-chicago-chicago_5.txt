Love this hotel! Not cookie cutter at all. The art displays were great, the service was top notch (especially by the doorman and bell hop), the room was cute, and the bed was comfortable. We stayed on the 16th floor in one of their studio rooms for two nights. Even though we paid extra for a room with a view, it wasn't that great of a view, so I'll skip that next time. Overall, a very comfortable stay that felt like a really awesome version of home!
