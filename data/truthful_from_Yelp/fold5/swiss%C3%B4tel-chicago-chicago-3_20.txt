The Swissotel gets my money as a better hotel than its hulking neighbor, the Hyatt. This glassy triangular tower has interesting design values inside and out. The rooms have a cool modern appearance, and the corner rooms are quite nice. The last time I walked through the lobby there were people smoking cigars, hookah pipes, and drinking who know what, so this may be the result of the hotel's European values.
