It's the best hotel I've ever stood in . It doesn't even feel like a hotel ; more like a resort.  Hospitality was outstanding , from the front seat service to the guys who work outdoor in the freezing Chicago climate parking your car . I loved the professionalism and the small things like waking you up in the mornings with paper and coffee served to you in your room. I also used all the facilities which were unbelievable.  However for the stay it wasn't cheap though they did upgrade room for no additional cost and it was worth ever penny .
