You gotta love this hotel. Perfect location, extremely pleasant helpful staff. (Even had a nice conversation with a maid). The concierge in the lobby was extremely helpful and friendly. You get a free bottle of distilled water and they refill it daily. ( needed after long walks with the crazies on Michigan avenue). Great food and live music in close proximity. I would skip their bar downstairs ( expensive) and go elsewhere for drinks.
