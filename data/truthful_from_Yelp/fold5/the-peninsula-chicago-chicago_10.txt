The high tea served in lobby taste even better than it looks, even it looks pretty enough.  The tea leaves are the good quality kind.  An excellent combination! Service is 5 star for sure! Free wifi, concierge charged my phone without me walking over, tea was refilled, was asked if I want to pick out all the tea leaves to avoid bitter taste - this is heart warming!  Server catered to my needs nicely, also offer newspaper when they saw me alone. Lobby looks 5 star of course. Just waiting for the live classical music, it will be a top of the world high tea experience.
