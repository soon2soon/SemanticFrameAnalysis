This place was absolutely amazing! The old georgian style B&B has really been updated and turned into one the most beautiful places I've ever stayed.  We stayed in the Milan Suite and it was a great place to sleep after a night of Lou Malnati's and Blue Man Group (both within walking distance). The service was great.  We got the wrong key for our room originally, and the caretaker quickly exchanged keys and personally went upstairs to verify it was the right one this time.  After Blue Man Group, we returned to the B&B and stayed up late in the downstairs living area in front of the fire drinking and laughing.  We could not find the TV remote, and when the caretaker came through, he offered to find a replacement. In the morning, we took our time getting up, and went downstairs for breakfast. Breakfast was DIY, with all the fixings all ready to go (i.e. Belgium waffle batter was already pre-mixed and measured out to just pour on the waffle maker).  We made ourselves breakfast with one other couple in this large beautiful kitchen and then packed up and checked out with no issue.
