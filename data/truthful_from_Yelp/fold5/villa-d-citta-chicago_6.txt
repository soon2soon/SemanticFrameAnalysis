This place is truly a gem. We had the whole villa to ourselves as a friend rented it for her birthday celebration. We had no complaints whatsoever....the place is immaculate, Ralph and his staff is extremely helpful, and the location is great (Lincoln Park). The rooms are spacious and have all the amenities you need. Very comfy beds. And the jacuzzi....well, need I say more??? We are already making plans to go back next year!
