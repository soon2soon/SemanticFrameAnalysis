(See update below and why they get 5 stars from this customer) Bad news always first.  The bartender was impressively rude.  Note:  I stayed on the night of Monday, February 24, 2014.  When I asked if there were mints, he said there were not.  I politely suggested they might want to have mints behind the bar, but he only shrugged.  I then politely said I may post the suggestion on Yelp, and you know what he said to me?  "Why don't you use social media for something useful or important."    I only laughed and said, "Oh I do all the time!" then I started to explain a little about how, but he wasn't interested.  It seemed he was only interested in expressing his dislike for me.  I never did let on how it bothered me, but the man I was with, whom I had just met, sure took notice.  HE was blown away by his rudeness.  He couldn't believe it.  After telling me he was a name I can't share, he asked "Doesn't he know he works for tips?" All that said, Roberta at the front desk more than made up for his idiotic behavior, and the accommodations all-around were far too delightful to allow a smug, bottom-dweller to ruin it all. No, after I make a call to ensure he at least receives a pink slip, all I will have are warm fuzzy, can't-wait-to-be-back feelings about The wonderful Allerton Hotel. Can't help but think of this... One of these things is not like the others, One of these things just doesn't belong, Can you tell which thing is not like the others By the time I finish my song?
