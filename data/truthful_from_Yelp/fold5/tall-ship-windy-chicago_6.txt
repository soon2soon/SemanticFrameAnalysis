We liked the tour. It was corny and fun but the boat is beautiful. The staff was funny and fun and they offered all kinds of information about the ship and navy pier history. They take your picture when boarding and you have the option to purchase it late.r They are not pushy about this either. It was very cold on the day we went and they had blankets all over the ship for the people attending. I thought that was a very thoughtful thing to do. It was fun and we enjoyed our time on the water.
