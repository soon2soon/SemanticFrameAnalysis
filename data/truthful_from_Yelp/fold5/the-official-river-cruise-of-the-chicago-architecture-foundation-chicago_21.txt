If you go to Chicago and have the chance to take this tour cruise DON'T PASS IT UP!  This has to be one of, if not the very best tour cruises I've ever gone on. The tour guide was absolutely amazing, and so was the weather. The guide was very informative, engaging, and easy to understand. Even with all of the history of the buildings he told us about he was able to throw in some funny stories with regards to some of the older buildings we passed along the way. This cruise is 90 minutes long, and if I was there by myself I would have taken it twice in one day. Once to take pictures and once to just soak in the experience of it all.  The buildings are really spectacular, and the history behind them just makes them even more interesting to see and experience in person. We were also told that we were very lucky to be on the cruise that morning because the overpass bridges don't normally open up, but people were beginning to dock their sail boats for the winter. The bridges were just opening up one after another. If I ever know of someone planning to visit Chicago I will always recommend they take this tour because it really is an experience you will always remember, and want to share with others.
