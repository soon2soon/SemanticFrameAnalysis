I can't believe I forgot to review this! I'm a fool. This review is from a couple of years ago, so there may have been a different President at that time. Take that into consideration when reading my review. (Wayne's World ditilly-do! ditilly-do! ditilly do! ditilly-do!) It was hot has Hades but my wife and I thought it looked fun. WHo doesn't want to ride around in a black schoolbus? They had AC, so the seats were not Untouchable...(sigh) The driver and the guide are both decked out in the costume de jour and throw a lot of "Sonny" ,"Toots" and Â "Fella" out at you and it's funny. The tour goes from River North, down to the South Side and even pass where the Chicago Fire presumably started. Then back up to Lincoln Park. It's a long tour with lots of info. Bring along a bottle of water and a snack if you can. It's fun, informative and we learned a bunch about our own neighborhood!
