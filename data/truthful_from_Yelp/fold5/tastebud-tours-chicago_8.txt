Tastebud Tour was awesome! I was very glad that the company operates all year round, especially since this was my boyfriend and my first time in Chicago. Food Tours are "our thing" to do whenever we visit a new city. We had the privilege of having Tiffany as well as the company owner, Lynn, host our group for the tour. It was the middle of December so temperatures were pretty cold but we stuck it out very enthusiastically. They were very knowledgable, personable and patient with our group. Both answered any questions we had, let us take tons of photos, and really showed us some of Chicago's great foods. My favorites were definitely the cupcakes from Sugar Bliss. The walk wasn't too bad and they allow plenty of time for rest, bathroom breaks, and shopping in some of the food stores. It was really great getting to know the city's finest cuisine and great things about Chicago from people who seem to be truly proud to be locals. I will definitely check out their New Orleans and San Francisco tours in the near future!
