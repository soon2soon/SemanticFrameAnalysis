This is the second year in a row that we have used VIP Limousine's services for prom limos.  Last year we had a 20 passenger Hummer and this year a 10 passenger limo.  I cannot rave enough about VIP Limo's wonderful services.  First, Anna, is the most amazing woman I have ever had the pleasure to deal with.  My group of kids were constantly changing their minds and Anna was so amazing each time I had to call her -once at 10:30 p.m. - she answered!!!!  I even had the wrong date and she was perfectly fine changing it. The kids both last year and this year had an amazing time!  This year, our driver was amazing, even taking the kids after prom to Gene and Judes, which the kids didn't even ask to be taken to!  He also drove them an additional hour to Salem, WI and got them all there safely and happy!   Kudos to VIP Limousine for such wonderful service and if you have the pleasure of dealing with Anna, you are one lucky person!  Thank you so much for giving our seniors such an amazing experience!
