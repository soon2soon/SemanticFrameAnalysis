There are two kinds of people when it comes to housing; chain people and non-chain people. If you want consistency, there are Marriotts and Hiltons. I'd rather stay in boutique hotels because the Hiltons and the Marriotts have enough money already.  :-) We came across the James Hotel via Priceline and it looked like a quirky but comfortable hotel, in a convenient location.  The decor is simple, Shaker meets Euro style and the staff are polite and friendly but not overly-familiar.  The beds are comfortable and rooms are a nice size - not palatial but not monastic. One nice touch -- filtered bottled water and glasses on your night table.  No $4.00 bottled Fiji water! We were on the third floor overlooking Ontario Street and the traffic noise was minimal.  Perfectly acceptable for an urban hotel. We didn't eat at the restaurant attached to the hotel as we're not overly-carnivorous, but it sure smells good.  I gained weight walking by the lobby. Who wouldn't like the James Hotel?  Claustrophobes (the elevator is small and fits 5-6 people). People who want everything to be the same everywhere they go.
