My wife and I spend our week vacation in Chicago and I have to say hands down Swissotel is a top place to stay.  Our room was great, the bathroom was really modern and with a nice view to the Navy Pier. the staff was really friendly, from the front desk to the housekeeping it was perfect.  The equipment at the gym is in great condition and the pool area is very neat.   We stayed during Lollapalooza and the location is perfect not just for the  festival but for  any activity you want to do in the city.   We didn't have  a chance to have drinks at the bar or use the internet so I have no comments on that.   We will definitely consider this Hotel for our future visits.
