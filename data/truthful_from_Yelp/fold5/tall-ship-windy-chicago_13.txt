I had such a good time on this boat tour.  We were on the tour called "A Sailor's Life for Me" (I think).  Pirate Dave told us lots of informative and really interesting things about life on both the open seas and Lake Michigan.  My niece is ten and loved it as did my mom.  All of the staff on the ship were incredibly kind, friendly, and fun.  It was really hilarious watching the volunteers on the ship, my fellow passengers, hoist the sails and it was a thing of wonder to watch the sails go up.   If you're not into pirate stories and the like, there are separate areas to sit, including a really beautiful bar and indoor seating area, and you can just relax and watch the beautiful view.   I highly recommend this to anyone, especially families, but really-- ANYONE.
