Wonderful modern hotel. The very nice desk clerk ... Anthony ... answered my plethora of questions very patiently and kindly. Stayed in a king bed suite. Well set-up, clean, and modern (my aesthetic). Two rooms ... a "living room" with pull-out couch, big-screen Samsung TV, desk, and wet bar with Keurig coffee maker and Starbucks pods (Pike Coffee). Cream was Coffeemate ... would have preferred half and half but I certainly won't quibble with it ... and a huge wardrobe with mirrors, iron and ironing board. Outlets available at the desk, at desk-height, to easily plug in your rechargeables ... also behind the coffeemaker, on the bedroom wall, and in the bathroom (obviously). In the bedroom, King-Size bed was extremely comfortable ... haven't slept that well for a long time, so time to change the home mattress I suppose ... with another big-screen Samsung TV, dresser, nightstands, and an iHome clock-radio with USB and bluetooth to play music from your mobile device/pad. Bathroom counter was nice and tall, and being 6'4", I truly appreciated this. Plenty of towels, a hair dryer, and walk-in shower for two with waterfall shower head. L'Occitane amenities. What I really appreciate is the detail on keeping noise down. All drawers, and even the toilet seat, are soft-close. Great views of the city from the windows. I normally sleep with a fan on at home to dampen outside noises. I didn't hear anything in this room with no fan on all-night long. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again the next time I'm in Chicago.
