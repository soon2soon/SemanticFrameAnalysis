We would highly recommend the Silversmith Hotel - its a great boutique style hotel that is close to Millennium Park, shops and transport. The staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were nice and clean. It has a great little restaurant and bar which doesn't get too crowded but is very good. It also seems very new. Will definately use this hotel again.
