"Now I'm going to play the Italian national anthem"... and on comes the theme song from the Godfather. The tour was so much fun, I took my parents and husband and we all had a blast. The history was great, we had two tour guides and they went back and forth throughout the tour. Other reviewers said the history part was light but I thought it was facinating and that they had alot of information. It was a good mix between history and light talk (or singing). The two hours went by super fast and we went all over the city. The meeting place was a little odd, but it works, we had a coffee at the rock n'roll McDonalds why we waited for the bus. Nice afternoon activity for guests who visit and then you can go check out the magnificent mile area.
