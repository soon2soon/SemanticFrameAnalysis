Great place to stay! Perfect if you really want to explore the city. Located in a GREAT neighborhood. Lots of restaurants, bars, and shopping. Close to a train stop. The staff was very friendly and helpful as far as giving suggestions of places to go in the area. Our room was very simple: Bunkbed (full on bottom, twin on top), bedding, desk, and chair (no TV to keep you from exploring). This place is considered a hostel, but suites w/ private baths are available (thats what we had). We were right next to the common room and didnt have any problems w/ noise. Now, the minute I heard "hostel" I had doubts. But this place was *very* clean, modern, and nice. We only went into the common room once or twice, but it was very cool: full kitchen, bathroom, coffee and tea, lots of seating, TV, games, computers, and a pool table. The free breakfast consists of bagels, cream cheese, cereal, and oatmeal. If thats not filling enough for you, the staff is more than happy to recommend some great breakfast places in the area. My only complaint would be that the pillows were awful, but we made them work. The next time were in Chicago, we'll be staying here.
