I love when guests come in from out of town, because I get to be a tourist for the day. I had a handful of friends come in from Boston that wanted to go on a Wrigley Field Tour. I've been to Wrigley more times than I can think of, but how cool tour the place.   We had an awesome tour guide named MC. I loved MC's knowledge of the game, the history of the park, his enthusiasm of the place and just an all-around great presenter...you could sense pride of the park and talked about his childhood memories of the game, as well.  MC guided us through the field, the locker room, the press box and the field, all while telling related stories along the way. I didn't find myself losing interest, like many other tour guides in other places. If you've never been, it's definitely worth it.  Even my Red Sox loving friends enjoyed it.  I walked away appreciating Wrigley Field more than I had 90 minutes prior to showing up.
