Eric was the weirdest tour guide ever, and I loved it. He led the devil in the white city tour with much enthusiasm, and even dressed in character! Although the tour locations were not super exciting (because most of the original stuff is long gone), I appreciated the history lesson and learned some new things. Very fun!
