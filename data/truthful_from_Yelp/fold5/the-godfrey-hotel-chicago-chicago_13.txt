I staid one week at the new Godfrey boutique hotel, in september 2014, 6 months after its opening and enjoyed a lot this place. I was in the 15th floor and never heard the music that could come from the wonderful I/O roofscape, even when the retractable roof was open until midnight. The service is excellent and very kind, as I've rarely seen in States. Pros: Kindness at the front desk and in the restaurant I/O roofscape Space in the bedrooms Large bathroom and shower Nice decoration Nice view on downtown buildings Very good neighborhood with good restaurants Cons: none!
