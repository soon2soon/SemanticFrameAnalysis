This was hands down the best Groupon deal I ever redeemed.  For $89.63 with tax, I had a wonderful night at the Silversmith hotel in a Queen room this past February.  Did I mention this included two free breakfasts?  It doesn't get better than this. The location for this hotel is fantastic.  You can get to every line within minutes, and there are fun things to do everywhere.  Being as it was freezing (shocker), I was quite happy to be close to a lot of things. I'm not sure where the comments about the hotel being old are coming from.  My room was in beautiful shape.  I was in a handicap room so the set up was a little odd, but it didn't bother me at all.  Comfy bed but I wish they had thicker comforters.  I was cranking the thermostat up to stay warm, but it was a great heater at least.  Lots of mirrors in the bathroom!!  Putting make up on in the morning has never been so easy.  Best hotel bathroom ever. The Silversmith hotel is very secure, and I like that you have to swipe a room key to get up to the floors with rooms.  As a young solo-traveling female, I felt 100% safe here the entire time.  I never heard the train, and my floor was pretty much always quiet.  This may have been because it was February, but I was happy to not have screaming, television-blasting neighbors. What put the place over the top was the great customer service.  The front desk was super friendly.  They let me check my bags during the day, and they were totally organized and found them right away when I needed them back.  There is water with lemon in the lobby as well, which was a simple but nice touch.  Someone was always holding the front door open on your way in and out of the hotel as well.  Fan. Thank you, Silversmith for a great experience.
