My friends and I have made the TikiBoat an annual occurrence because it is so much fun. Sadly, the aforementioned owner Paul passed away and the original TikiBoat sunk (separate occurrences I have been told). However, there is a new TikiBoat and owner, which we booked last summer and will book again this summer. It's a little bit more expensive than the original, but they are much more organized and make the booking and paying process easier. We also did not have to find our own captains, which we did on the original. It comes with a captain and first mate now. Book it, grab 11 friends, bring some food, and drinks, and once the cost is split 12 ways, it's affordable for anyone. Don't forget the tip!
