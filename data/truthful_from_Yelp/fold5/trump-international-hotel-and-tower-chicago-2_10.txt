Donald Trump is a buffoon.  Yep, he is the poster child for the word buffoon. So that said, how is he able to create such amazing places with service to match?  Hell if I know! Trump Chicago is lovely. Ya, it's pricey but well worth the price of admission.  The rooms are some of the largest in the industry, have incredible views and Mr. Buffoon nailed it with the amenities.   The spa floor is the best.  Great place to go with your hubs or girlfriends but not at the same time (unless you roll that way).  Halls are wide and everyone strolls around in their trump robes. Restaurants and bar round out the experience with more great views and impeccable service.   Go sell a kidney so can stay here.  It really is worth it.
