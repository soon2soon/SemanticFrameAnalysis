Great company! I would use them again in a heartbeat. I worked with James, and we ended up getting the 30-seater bus. Our original pickup driver, Dave, was very nice. He handled a bunch of semi-drunk bachelorette party girls well. The driver that picked us up, Ari, was very nice too. He also handled us very well!
