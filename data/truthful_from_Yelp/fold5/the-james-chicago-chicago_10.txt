We stayed at the James for 3 nights and we were very impressed.  Our room was on the 16 floor and and a great view looking west.  The room was modern with nice clean lines. Our room had a great built in bench with a table that made for great place to have coffee and use the laptop in the morning. Free Wifi was excellent.  The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows! The hotel staff was great from the doormen, front desk, and concierge. The concierge gave us a great recommendation for dinner on our last night.   The hotel is located in a perfect location: 1 block from Michigan Ave for shopping, a short 2 block walk to the Red Line to go to sites throughout the city.  We appreciated the complementary filtered water each day, the in room products (shower, lotion, soap) were nice.  When we needed ice we just had to call down to the front desk. Drawback was $65 for parking per night but that includes in and out privileges.  I guess that is the cost for staying in such a great location! We will be back!
