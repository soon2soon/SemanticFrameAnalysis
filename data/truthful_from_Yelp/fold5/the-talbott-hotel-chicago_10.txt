Stayed here for my husband's Bday/NYE. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I told them ahead of time that it was my husband's bday so they left him a little treat of chocolate truffles in our room with a nice note. The room was clean and comfortable. The only downside was the jacuzzi tub. Turned on the jets and nasty stuff spewed out. I'll give them a break on that though since we've experienced this in many hotels. The jets just don't get used often so things build up. It would be a complete waste of water to fill the tub up just to run it and drain it at each cleaning. We also ate breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and were satisfied. The staff throughout the place was very kind. Would definitely stay here again.
