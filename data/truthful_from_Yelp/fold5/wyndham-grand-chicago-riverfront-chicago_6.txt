It has been a while since I was surprise by how good of a deal a hotel was, but the Wyndham did it for me. For the price I paid I expected a basic hotel room, the room we got was huge! So that was sweet. I also enjoyed the rain shower head, and the impeccable service. The location is pretty awesome too.
