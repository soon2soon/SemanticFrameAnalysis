Hands down the best hotel experience I've ever had, and I work in the industry. My husband and I had just stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We chose Talbott because of the yelp reviews and pictures, so thank you! Upon arrival we were happily greeted by the bellman, and informed at the desk that they had given us a complimentary upgrade. The room was amazing and beautiful, which set the tone for a great first visit to Chicago. Location wise, we found it very easy to navigate the city from the hotel. We were able to walk to Lincoln Park/ Lincoln Park zoo, millennium park, magnificent mile, and all of the nearby shops. Wrigley field and navy pier were also easily accessible from public transportation. They have a full service concierge, cafe, free wifi, and access to a nearby gym. We will definitely stay here every future trip to Chicago.
