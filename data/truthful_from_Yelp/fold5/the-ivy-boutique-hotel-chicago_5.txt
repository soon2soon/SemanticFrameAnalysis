I am a modern design fanboy, so this hotel was an easy 5 stars. They have everything super modern and I love it. I think this is my new hotel of choice when I come to Chicago. To name a few things abstract decorations, low modern platform bed, comfy bed, TV in the bathroom mirror(yes that's right), wall hanging tv, nice temp controls, huge bathtub, rainfall shower that has a nice lift block, beautiful artwork, great lighting and much more. As I said before if its modern I most likely will love it and this hotel is one of my favs going forward. Staff was helpful as well and they had free wifi. All smiles for my stay here.
