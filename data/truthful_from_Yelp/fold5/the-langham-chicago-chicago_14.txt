This review is about the High Tea at Pavilion Restaurant. From the moment I made the reservation for the tea, until the moment we go in the cab to leave it was a magical experience. I got a personal phone call to reserve the tea. They asked several times if there were any allergies. They asked on the phone and when you are seated at the table. It was a blustery, snowy day at the end of October when we had tea. They took our coats and set us up near the window facing the street. The decor of this place is just slap yo' mama for not having a rich husband wow. Our server was on point. Informative and engaging. He let us luxuriate as long as we liked. The food was so good. And it's a lot of food. We ended up taking our desserts back to the hotel with us. The menu changes frequently, but I'm sure it's all fabulous. You should come for the tea and scones, but you'll hang around for the piano player, flutes of champagne, cozy decor and SUPERB service. Thanks for making a regular rainy Friday in to an unforgettable day.
