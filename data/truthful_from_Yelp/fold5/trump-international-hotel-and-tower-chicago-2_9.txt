If I was filming a rap video for myself, I would get a room at the Trump, and re-enact my 2 days there.  You know, sitting in a bath tub, watching a TV that's built into the bathroom mirror, drinking champagne and eating gold/chocolate covered strawberries...normal Tuesday night stuff. I knew going in that this hotel was going to be legit, but I was literally blown away by everything I experienced here.  This place is first class all the way.  As soon as I stepped into the suite, I immediately got depressed that in 2 days I'd have to go back to my apartment that is much smaller than my digs at the Trump. The one bedroom suite had a living room with a fireplace, 55 inch TV, full kitchen, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on, and an amazing view of the river.  The service was unreal, from the bellhop bringup up all our bags, to the champagne delivery, to the turn down service that included roses on the bed (it was our mini honeymoon).  My wife literally cried of happiness twice during our stay. There really isn't anything else I can say except anyone who rates this less than 5 stars must be a real asshole.
