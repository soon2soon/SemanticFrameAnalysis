What a fun tour! After (finally) reading "Devil in the White City," I knew my Chicago experience would not be complete without a Weird Chicago tour. We took the 3-hour hauntings tour, lead by our hilarious and talented guide, Eric. To be honest, my friend and I were a bit worried about the length of the tour, but in reality, we were surprised how quickly it went! We visited many haunted spots in the city, the highlight being "Death Alley" behind the former Iroquois Theater (now the Oriental). Almost everyone who took pictures had something weird about the way the photo turned out. The stop for a drink at the Congress Hotel was also a nice touch - AND for the use of the bathrooms! Speaking of drinks, one of the tie-ins to the story about Adolf Luetgert, sausage king-turned-murderer, was to a bar he once owned, now called the Drinkingbird. This piqued my interest, and I will be returning for a haunted pub crawl soon! I hope Eric is our guide; he really was great - so dramatic!
