We stayed here through Christmas and we had a great time.  The gym was open 24 hours, which is hard to find in any hotel, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The hotel was very cheap given the holiday season and was the best value among the rest of the hotels in the same Michigan Ave area.  The food was good, but I would recommend eating at the restaurant since the room service was 3 times more expensive than the breakfast buffet. The room was very spacious and clean.  The only downside is you'll have to pay for wifi for each of the nights you stay.  I recommend not getting the wifi and just connecting at a local cafe or starbucks.
