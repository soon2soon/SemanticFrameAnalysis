I've never stayed at a hostel before and wasn't sure what I got myself into but this place is great! The hostel is a two minute walk to the Addison red line stop which takes you downtown in under 20 minutes. However, you're in Wrigleyville and there are so many great bars and restaurants near the hostel that are all within walking distance for a great night out. What sold me when looking at their website was the pool table! There's also TV, darts, ping pong and lots of games to keep yourself busy. They have a kitchen that you can use and store your food in. They also provide a free breakfast every morning. There are so many travelers that come in and out of the hostel that you get to meet tons of great people. They have a bar crawl every Thursday night, which most people staying there participate in, and it's a great time! The staff is super friendly and helpful. They keep the rooms clean and tidy for a comfortable stay. I recommend this hostel, it's fun, safe and in a great location!
