This is truly an incredible service.  I never thought I'd be so happy with a company regarding something as mundane as passport renewal. I have my honeymoon in 2 months and didn't want to trust the post office/government with my passport renewal and was also worried about making a mistake on my paperwork which would cause delay.  I essentially did not want to have to worry about it at all and I didn't thanks to Swift. I found this place on Yelp and couldn't be happier with the service.  I literally dropped my old passport off on Friday morning, had my new photo snapped with an iPhone, and was out of there in less than 5 minutes....And despite literally paying for their slowest service possible (14 days), my new passport was ready on Monday afternoon!! Literally less than 2 business days.  Completely incredible!  Needless to say, for a task that is usually a difficult, time consuming, and stressful process - Swift passport made it incredibly easy.  Money well spent. As if the incredible speed wasn't enough, they also have incredibly pleasant people working there and  a cool, modern office in a prime location.  It is also very tech savvy -- I very much appreciated getting update emails regarding every step of the process, itemized receipts via email, etc. Thank you!  I'm spreading the word.  If you're reading this and are trying to decide where to go to get  your passport renewed, don't even hesitate and head to this place.
