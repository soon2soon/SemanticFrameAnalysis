I had a great experience here over Valentine's Day weekend.  First of all, the lobby is very modern and sleek.  There's lots of little alcoves and places to sit while you wait.  Check in and check out was fast.  The rooms were huge, clean, and comfy.  Everything about the room have a fresh trendy vibe.  The bathroom was super big for being a hotel bathroom. I love that they use L'Occitane toiletries.  I also got to check out the spa.  It's smaller than I'd expect for the size of the hotel, but cozy and very nice.  There was one issue with someone charging my room for a valeted car, but at check out the charge was removed and it never actually went through on my credit card.  I'd definitely recommend a stay here.  It's a great hotel at a great location.
