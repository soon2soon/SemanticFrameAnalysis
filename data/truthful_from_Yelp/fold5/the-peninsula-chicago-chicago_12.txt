My review is for the gym / spa only.  If you're a swimmer, this is your place. Twenty five meter pool with three lanes heated to just the perfect temperature.  Beautiful atrium setting with a nice view, comfy lounge chairs for relaxing post-swim. Complimentary tea and bottled water. Awesome locker room showers. Outstanding service. The only thing missing is a selection of classes every day, though there is a 6:30am yoga class on weekdays. The spa area has a cozy fireplace, yummy little snacks, and some ergonomically designed beds for relaxing under heavy blankets.  It's all a little piece of heaven after being outside in the Chicago winter.
