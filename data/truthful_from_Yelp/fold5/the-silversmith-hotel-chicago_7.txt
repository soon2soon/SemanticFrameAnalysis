We had selected the Silversmith based on the awesome Expedia deal we found, but were completely blown away with the results. We saw that it looked like a 5-star hotel, but it was so much more than we were expecting. Right off the bat, we were greeted with the friendliest doorman, who helped 5 girls who over packed take our luggage up to our room. The entire staff was phenomenal, and saw to our requests right away. Whether it was more ice, clean towels, extra pillows & blankets, and even bandaids - everything was done promptly and with a smile. We were treated as if we were the only guests, and the entire staff could not have been any nicer. I will definitely be booking here every time I come back to Chicago! The Cloud Gate is SO close, you have to go in the early morning when no one is there! The staff are VERY friendly at helping you hail a cab, but if you're up for it, Navy Pier and Soldier Field are about a 30 minute walk away. We were in town for the One Direction concert, so walking seemed like a better option than waiting in traffic :)
