My hubby surprised me with a weekend staycation for our first wedding anniversary, which included an overnight stay at the Trump. It was easily the most expensive (and highest class) hotel I've ever been in, but it was amazing! This is actually the second Trump Hotel I've stayed at (I've been to the Trump International Hotel and Resort in Sunny Isles, Florida), but I felt like the room in this particular location was somewhere I could consider living for the rest of my life - kitchen appliances, pots/pans/dishes, the coziest King size bed, a TV in the bathroom mirror!? Even a selection of several spring waters to quench my thirst at any given moment (for a price, of course). The front desk staff was very nice and made note that we were celebrating our anniversary - complimentary golden chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us when we got back from dinner! Did I mention the Buffalo Sabres (yes, the entire team!) spent the night at the hotel when we did, too? This place is TOP NOTCH!
