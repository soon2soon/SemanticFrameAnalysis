I love this hotel. The rooms are really comfortable with beautiful, modern decor. The staff is excellent and you get a warm chocolate chip cookie when you check in! Their gym facilities are quite nice (don't be fooled by the purple lighting, you are on the right floor) and I hear the spa is excellent! This is my second time staying here and I will definitely be back. You can also earn Hilton Honors points when you stay.
