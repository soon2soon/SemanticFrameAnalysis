This is the place to be if you want spectacular view of the city from your room. You get amazing experience of luxury stay at really affordable price. Rooms are amazingly clean and greatly laid out. Amenities in room are great. Restaurant on site has good food and great service. I have stayed numerous times in Hilton and Marriott but none of them can match the quality of this hotel. Beds are super cozy.
