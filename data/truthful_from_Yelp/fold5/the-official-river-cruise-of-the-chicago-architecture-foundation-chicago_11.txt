We are here on vacation and one of my friends that used to live here made the recommendation for us to give this a go and so we did! Wow,  what  a great experience! We cruised down the river while our tour guide told us about all the great history behind the city and buildings.  She was very Knowledgeable and knew her facts! The tour was about an hour and the picture ops were absolutely amazing! Imagine being able to get those scenic shots right from the water! Amazing! Here's a couple tips.  1. Be mindful of the time you choose because if the sun is up too high it obstructs the view.  2. If you can time it right so you begin before sunset and roll through the sunset,  you will definitely get a few great Kodak moments!
