Everyone who lives or visits Chicago should take this tour at least once! It is a very nice scenic view through the Chicago River as well as the north shore of Lake Michigan. I went on the 5PM tour and the wait was minimal. The tour will be at least 60 minutes and you learn a lot of history of the buildings/neighborhoods close by. The tours  range from  $25/per person. I would say it is worth it!
