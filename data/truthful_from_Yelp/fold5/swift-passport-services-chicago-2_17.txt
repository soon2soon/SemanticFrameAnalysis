When I realized 4 days before a trip to Canada that my passport was expired, I was completely panicked! Someone told me to look up expediting services, and I was very skeptical of paying a large amount of money to a company who claimed they could get me a renewed passport the same or next day. SPS did just that, and answered all of my questions as to how they do it (they pay for a standing appt at the passport agency each day). They are super friendly, extremely organized, you get automated emails when your info is received, being processed, and completed, there office is hip and trendy, and the experience was great!! It costs an arm and a leg, by it was my own idiotic fault and forgetting to do this months in advance, so this was a lifesaver! I realized my passport was expired at 6pm on a Friday and had a new passport in my hands at 5pm on a Monday.
