My husband and I went out on tall ship windy on Sunday, August 24,2014 at the 7:30 sailing.  The weather was perfect, but without any wind, we used the motor for our trip.  This did not take anything away from the adventure.  We enjoyed the views, and got a bonus of seeing fireworks too.  The crew is friendly and we had a great time.  I hope to go again.  Thank you
