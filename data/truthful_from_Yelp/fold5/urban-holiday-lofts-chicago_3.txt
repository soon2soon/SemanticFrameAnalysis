After staying in this hostel, I'm convinced that a single person traveling doesn't need to pay expensive hotel rates. I had a fantastic stay. The hostels are extremely clean, and they provide additional towels and blankets for no extra charge. They also have a continental breakfast in the morning, which makes it quite easy to get out the door. Close to the CTA station, which has a La Colombe coffee shop right next to it - if you're looking for a nice strong cup of coffee to get you going.
