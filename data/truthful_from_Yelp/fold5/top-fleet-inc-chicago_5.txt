My friend used them for her wedding on 10/17 to drive us to take pictures and to and from the hotel and reception. They were great! Arrived on time, the bus was huge and very comfortable. We had about 15 people on board and we were able to fit a full size cooler on there too! Drive was friendly and let us have privacy. We has a blast listening to music and just enjoying ourselves. Not exactly sure about the prices but I know the bride shopped around and she said it was a good price. I would recommend if you are looking for one, we had a lot of fun!
