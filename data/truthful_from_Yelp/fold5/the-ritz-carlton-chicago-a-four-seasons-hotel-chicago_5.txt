Came here for their Sunday Brunch. For what you got in food quality and selection quantity, it was well worth the price. The food is set up in multiple rooms. Everything was delicious. Left with a full stomach and I didn't eat again until late evening. I was impressed that they had an area set up with foods for children. Cereals, macaroni & cheese and corn dogs were just some of the items. Not a weekly, monthly or even yearly opportunity for me but I will come back again.
