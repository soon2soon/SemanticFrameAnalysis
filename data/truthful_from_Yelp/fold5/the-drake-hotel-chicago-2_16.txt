I go there every year for Christmas afternoon tea. So beautiful and the gift shop is lovely.They always have a scented candle or an ornament I like to purchase. The staff is friendly and the doormen are nice and helpful. Everyone is treated well even if you do not have a lot of money. I love this place!!
