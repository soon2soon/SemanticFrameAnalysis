Tourists and locals alike will experience Chicago in a new way. I've been twice now; once during the day and once at night. Both spectacular experiences! I'm not much of a "outdoor adventure" person, but the tour guides and guys at the shop helped me feel confident and safe the whole time. The owner is passionate, professional, and knowledgable. The experience is really affordable. Equipment is clean and new. Can't wait to do it again!
