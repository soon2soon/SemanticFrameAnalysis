scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.… My son wanted to execute a surprise proposal aboard the Tall Ship Windy during the Saturday night fireworks cruise which I thought would be a very challenging feat.  I was pleasantly surprised and totally proven wrong.  The Owner, Crew, and Staff were so accommodating and helpful.  From the very first phone call, they were willing to help and participate in any way they could.  The entire crew was able to keep our secret and "play along" with our plan.  The night went off without a hitch, and I have TSW to thank for that!  Thank you for making this once-in-a-lifetime event amazing and one will never forget.  Absolute Kudos to the Crew and Staff.  We will definitely be sailing with TSW again and again.
