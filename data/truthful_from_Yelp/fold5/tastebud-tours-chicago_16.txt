My teenage daughter and I had a fantastic time on Tastebud Tours. The perfect mix of great food, interesting Chicago history, and a bit of exercise. We tasted deep dish pizza, Chicago hotdogs, burgers from the Billy Goat Tavern, brownies, handcrafted chocolates and some delicious gumbo, of all things. We ate so much that we actually skipped dinner that night! Jaime Lyn was our tour guide, and she was a font of knowledge about Chicago. She was personable and gracious, and seemed to enjoy her job. We also got to spend time with the owner, Lynn, who seems like a terrific guy. He has a real passion for Chicago and for food, so this is the perfect business for him. He also mentioned being involved in charitable work that helps feed kids in poverty, so as you are enjoying the tour, you are also helping to do some good in the world. What could be better than that? Good times; highly recommend!
