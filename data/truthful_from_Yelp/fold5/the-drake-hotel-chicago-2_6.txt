Came here with my wife for Easter Brunch. Pure luxury! Tables were beautifly set with lovely centerpiece's. Waiters kept all your beverage glasses/cups filled at all times. The food selections were plentiful and vast. Everything I had was delicious. It was nice to experience for just a couple of hours what Royalty, Heads of State and Entertainers experience daily!
