well... of course my agency paid for the suite here. Nice views of the Sears Tower and Lake Michigan from 35th floor of the Swissotel can only compare to our very own Mandarin Oriental. Owned by the Swiss Tourism Group, it's a very comfortable existence for a good nights sleep but if you wanna eat, try somewhere else. Not only they'll stuff you with a gigantic plate of mashed potatoes, at the end they'll slap you with a massive bill, which your boss may decide not to pick up. Overall, I loved my stay at Swissotel - the only place I ever stayed in the great Midwest!
