I really love this hotel. I love the fact that its more of a boutique hotel, so you dont have as much of a crowd to deal with when checking in or out, and also when entering and exiting your hotel room. You don't want to miss out staying at this hotel. Good rates, hotel is still fairly new, great service, great rooftop, great location to access restaurants, fast food, shopping, grocery stores, convenient stores and to cabs. Hotel rooms are spacious and chic'. Arrival: Upon arriving, check-in was a 2 minute process. There was no wait and i asked if they were able to accommodate my online request for a corner hotel room, and they confirmed that they had already assigned me to a room located at the corner which was great. They also offered me a tour of the hotel, or asked if i wanted a brief explanation of the hotel's amenities. With this being my 2nd time staying at the hotel, i didnt need this, but thought it was still great to offer. Service: Service is prompt when requesting anything from the front desk. I also called the front desk at midnight to request a late checkout and they asked me what time would work for me. Â I asked for 2:00pm, and they are able to immediately accommodate which was wonderful. Additional Highlights: The IO Urban rooftop is phenomenal. This area is open year-round, but during the winter it is enclosed so you can still see the wonderful views but you are shielded from the cold weather. Multiple bars, tv's to watch sports, and food are all available. Additionally, the rooms are nice and are spacious for downtown chicago. I was able to get a deal for $89 with a great view both from my room and my bathroom. Also had a large king size bed that is extremely comfortable and a flat screen tv. I had friends staying in the same hotel, and was able to have enough space and chairs for them to also congregate in my room without being cramped.
