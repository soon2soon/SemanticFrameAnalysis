Villa D' Citta is a Beautiful little b&b. If you don't know where to look for it you wont find it. It's hidden pretty well in a nice cute Lincoln park neighborhood. But once inside you'll be in awe of how spacious and beautiful the place is. There are 6 rooms each distinct and luxourious. I spent some time there for a friend's birthday party and we had a blast.  Not only were the accommodations wonderful,clean, and beautiful but I felt safe and welcomed by the staff and others who were staying there. There was a serious family vibe. And not in a "somebody please get your children" way that I feel in a lot of places I stay.  I know some people may be turned off by this next point but I loved it. You get to (have to) cook your own food! They will put whatever u want in the fridge and you cook it. How cool is that! Best part is someone else comes by and cleans up after you! For those of you who don't cook there are a pleathora of restaurants and bars close by so even if they won't cook for you another place within walking distance will. All in all I loved this place and I can't wait to go back!
