This review is for an event that was held here. The Modern Bride magazine hosted a bridal event with the Spring 2016 Collection of Vera Wang wedding dresses showcased toward the end of the evening. There was a beautiful spinning table with glasses of bubbly, it was absolutely gorgeous. The snacks that were distributed to the guests were delicious, and FREE. Lucky brides were given swag bags at the end of it. I just love events where there's free stuff given out!
