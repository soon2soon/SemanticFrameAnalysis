Trump definitely knows how to luxury things up.  Yeah, it's expensive, but time to time, there are deals to be had.  Because people think it's expensive, one of the only hotels that would have rooms available during high travel seasons and peak convention seasons. The rooms are amazing, spacious, and all with kitchenette.  The bathroom mirror has built in TV, so you could keep up with the latest news while brushing your teeth.  Love the built-in mirror TV.  The services are fantastic. Shoe shine service comes in very handy; leave your shoes out in the evening and you'll have a nicely shined shoes in the morning. There is a complimentary black car service for local area destination, which is a great way to go to a nice restaurant for dinner. You must try 16, a Michelin star restaurant at the Trump.  The pre-fix lunch is a great deal and you should give it a try.  A very nice outdoor patio area during the warmer weather.  Of course the food is all amazing at 16. The location of the hotel is also a key aspect of the overall experience. In central downtown Chicago and adjacent to the Chicago River. Tons of restaurants all within walking distance. Just couple of blocks from the "magnificent mile" from all the shopping you may want to do.  Lake Michigan is also just several blocks away. I always enjoy my stay here whenever I get to visit Chicago and find a great deal on the room. The concierge at the hotel is a wizard in getting a table at tough to find reservation restaurants. Hey, when Trump calls, they answer!
