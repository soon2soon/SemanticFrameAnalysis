Great hotel and great location.  Parking is a little pricey but the in /out for 1 fee ever a out if you need to use your car.  The roof top club is awesome but get there early and be prepared to spend some $$$. But then again it's Chicago you should be prepared to spend some $$$! Concierge is very knowledgeable and helped us find a nice cigar lounge around the corner. I'd probably say this is going to be our go to Chicago spot.
