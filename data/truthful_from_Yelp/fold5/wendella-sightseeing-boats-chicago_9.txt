A must do in Chicago! We planned this activity as one of the first things to do on our trip to get a tour of the buildings in the city and we had an awesome time! Chicago's architecture is truly amazing! I would recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago. The views from the river were beautiful and it was a very relaxing ride. This activity was fun and informative. Make sure you wear sunscreen and a hat!
