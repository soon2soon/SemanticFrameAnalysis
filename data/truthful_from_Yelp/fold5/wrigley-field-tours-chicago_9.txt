Awesome tour.  Our guide was informative, funny and patient.  We hade tickets for the 10am tour but had arrived at 9:00am - had no problem incorporating us into this slot. Which we were grateful cause tour was almost 2 hrs and going with the early group allowed us more free time in the afternoon. The place is amazing. The history. We were able to see almost everything.  There were few areas off limits.  We even got to see the players locker room.  We did go on a non game day.   Heard they are going to be doing some renovations to the place, glad to see it as it is now.   Only thing I was sorry about, there really is not any place to buy a souvenir.  You have to visit the stores around the area for that. Would recommend a trip out to the ball park!
