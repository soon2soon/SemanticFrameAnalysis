Windy City Travel rocks!!!  I've heard that a woman named Marcie Alison has impressed some very close friends of mine.  I have used Windy City for years myself.  I have also dealt with Marcie and she has been nothing short of helpful.  She has found me great deals on air and hotel for national /international travel. This past year, my friend got married in Las Vegas and Marcie took care of everything -  And I mean everything!  People coming from cities from all around the country.  She was a logistical whiz!  When they got to where they were going for their honeymoon, they quickly decided we weren't happy with the location. Not a problem for Marcie.  Efficiently and professionally, she absolutely bailed them out so they could have the honeymoon experience that every newlywed dreams and hopes for.  She worked past her regular hours in order to give them the best experience possible.  My friends ultimately had a beautiful honeymoon that truly would never have happened if it weren't for Marcie Allison's compassion, perseverance, dedication, and honest hard work that went far beyond her job description.  I, too, will continue to use Windy City Travel.  I think I will use her for my honeymoon after hearing my friends rave about her.  Oh that's right, I need a husband first....  THUMBS UP, Marcie!
