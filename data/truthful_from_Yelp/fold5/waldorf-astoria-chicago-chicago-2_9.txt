Stayed here for my wedding night on 8/1/14. From the moment I reserved our room to the time we checked out was incredibly amazing! They treated us like queens. The note from the GM with a bottle of champagne congratulation on our big day to the host at the desk to the great & friendly bartenders Maya & Ray they were all so very nice. We had a luxury suite with rose pedals leading to our bed, the room was romantic & very clean. The soaking bathtub was to die for. The in room service breakfast the next morning was great! And since I was not able to get a early check in due to Lollapalooza they gave us a late checkout which worked out even better. I was able to enjoy the stay a little longer. I would love to stay here again. Thank you to the whole staff for making our night very special. I'm so glad I choose the Waldorf over the Trump.
