Cannot say enough great things about this sightseeing tour. We had Jack as our tour guide and sincerely enjoyed his presentation and added humor. The price is about what we have spent on other tours in other cities. The boat was large with an upper and lower deck so plenty of space to see by standing or sitting. We heard about the history and architectural information of building. This information is not to be mistaken for something only architecture fans would like. My 14 year-old daughter loved it just as much as I did. They had a bad/little dining room area with both adult beverages and coke. They also had some snack items, too. We had an absolutely beautiful day for the tour today and loved every second of it! You will not regret going on this tour and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
