Favorite hotel in Chicago hands down. I have stayed here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. They have the friendliest and nicest staff and the rooms are the cleanest I've ever been in. After staying in this hotel I cannot imagine staying anywhere else. Now I just need to find an excuse to come back right away!
