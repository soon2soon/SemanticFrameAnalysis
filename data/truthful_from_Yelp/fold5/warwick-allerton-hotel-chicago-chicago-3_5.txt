My husband and I had our wedding ceremony and reception here last month and could not have been more impressed.  Our coordinator Sheila was absolutely wonderful and assisted us with every last detail to make our wedding absolutely fabulous!  The entire staff was wonderful; I had several guests tell me that all of the servers and bartenders were incredibly helpful and friendly throughout the night.  After having my photos taken before the ceremony, the bottom of my dress was a bit muddy since it was a rainy day -- the staff went out to get Tide sticks from CVS to help me clean my dress!   The food and drinks were also so delicious, as well as the late night munchies.  Our cake from Bombon was a big hit with everyone (s'mores and pumpkin flavors).  Our suite was spacious and clean, with a nice wet bar.  I could go on and on, but if you're thinking of having your wedding downtown, definitely consider the Allerton hotel, as it was perfect and all of my guests had a blast :) (our photos are gorgeous as well, and the location cannot be beat!)
