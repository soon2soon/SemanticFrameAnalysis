I booked a tour with Wateriders for a company outing with 15 people. They dealt with our crazy schedules and changes, and answered every question promptly and thoroughly. They were very easy to work with and scheduled a tour at an unscheduled time to make sure our group was catered to. So, I had high hopes. And they were exceeded! Joel, our tour guide, was an absolute delight. He clearly loves his job and is excited about the city of Chicago. He was a wealth of information regarding architecture and history, and even made a requested stop along the tour to show us a building that caught our CEO's eye. And not only did he stop, but he knew the architect and history behind it. These guys do their jobs well and several of us will be back individually to enjoy a tour in the future.
