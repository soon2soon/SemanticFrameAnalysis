This is where I am at with my review at this moment. I got in a couple of hours ago and have been up ever since admiring this very beautiful 1 Bedroom suite.. Note, I said only the room. Ive yet to wander off on the property. Staff is on point! So friendly and warm. I wasn't expecting the suite but BOY this is living. They've thought of EvERY convenience. I mean come on.. Puppy pampering, catering for guests you entertain in your room, TV in the bathroom mirror, etc..etc..   Ive yet to give the pool, room service and spa a try yet.. I so hope to find time. Its so easy to forget Im here on business.  I'll def update this throughout my stay.
