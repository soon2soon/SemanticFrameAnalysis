I grew up as on Oriole fan, I know thanks for the sympathy.  But much of the time during the early afternoon I would always end up turning on WGN and a Cubs game was on.  Love watching the Cubs growing up and always wanted to see a game at Wrigley or atleast take a tour.  Well the Cubs were acrossed town playing the White Sox during our visit so my wife and I took a tour.   What a beautiful ballpark and finally seeing it in person was just amazing.  Even if your not a baseball fan you can truly appreciate the history this park as to offer.   Our tour guide was excellent, he knew everything about the park and also was telling us some of his personal experience he had just watching games and being a fan.  The bleacher bums stories were the best!!  The tour was $25 each and my daughter of 2 years of age was free and it was worth every penny, I probably would have paid $50.  Anytime I'm in Chicago I will come to Wrigley again to tour or to see a game, hopefully next time I will be able to catch a game.
