Had a great experience with the hotel for 13 nights for my holidays and work trip with the family.  The management truly made my stay welcoming.  Esther with the hotel corporate sales group made my stay so nice and the staff did a great job everyday with cleaning my room and my laundry was turned around so quickly for me.  The location of hotel is in the heart of the loop and surrounded with amazing restaurants and bars and entertainment.  The other aspect of the hotel that was great is the gym - very nice size and the equipment gives you a good options to do a lot of exercise programs. Will be staying again I'm sure for work.
