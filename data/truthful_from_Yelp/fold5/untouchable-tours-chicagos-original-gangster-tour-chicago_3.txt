A really fun and entertaining afternoon!  South Side and Knuckles were our tour guides.  Both were funny, helpful, knew a LOT about the gangster days and listened to some of 'our' comments as we had a few places that weren't 'on' the tour but that were of interest. A GREAT way to relax while enjoying Chicagoland.  Urge you to do this tour.
