BEYOND AMAZED with Swift! We dropped by Monday afternoon at 3pm with all our paperwork and did the regular service to get the Passport done. Just paid the normal fee knowing that it'll be done in approximately 7-10 business days, which was great since my girlfriend would need the Passport then. But it turns out that it was completed on Wednesday afternoon. It was shipped out 1-day expedited and got it on Thursday! They were of great help getting us going. Will definitely recommend to anyone who needs their Passports taken care of swiftly! :)
