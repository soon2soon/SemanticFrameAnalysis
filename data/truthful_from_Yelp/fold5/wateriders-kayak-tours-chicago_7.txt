I went on a tour a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and we had the best time!  I always loved going on the big ships for the architecture tours, mostly because it reminds me of My Best Friend's Wedding and I'm just secretly looking for Dermot Mulroney so he can whisper sing a Tony Bennett song in my my ear, BUT, this is the way to do the Chicago architecture tour!  We were on the water for about 2.5 hours, which was so cool, and the boats are really easy to maneuver.  We were in a tandem kayak because we're in love, so.  You can choose which kind you prefer.   Our tour guide was Seth, and not only was he personable and nice, he was also really funny and really knowledgable about the city.  He introduced everyone to everyone else, he sang Irish songs, and he led us on a freaking great tour.  He was a rockstar, and at the end of the tour he made sure everyone had a nice time and helped with bringing our kayaks back to the shop.   I can't recommend this tour enough.  The truth is, you probably aren't going to find Dermot on those big boats (trust me, it's a nowhere road) - but if you go to Water Riders, you will find Seth, a real person who leads you, singing, around our incredibly beautiful city on a kayak.  Do it!
