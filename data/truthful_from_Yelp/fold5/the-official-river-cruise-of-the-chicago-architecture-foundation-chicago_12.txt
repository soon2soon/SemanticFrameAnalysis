Hands down the best thing to do while visiting or living in Chicago.  I joined the CAF when I moved here in June and I have gone on the river cruise 5 times already.  I take my visiting friends on this tour and everyone loves it.  The Docents are top notch, each bringing their own personal style to the tour with fun stories and different perspectives.  These amazing ambassadors are volunteers and they go through extensive training.  Obviously spring, summer and fall are the best times to hit the river but I have to say that it is great even when the temps plunge into the teens.  You can pop inside to thaw out and the bar serves up some good warmer uppers :)
