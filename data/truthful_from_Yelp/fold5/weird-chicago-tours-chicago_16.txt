We signed up for the Devil in the White City tour without really knowing to expect. The confirmation email we received was incredibly helpful. When we arrived for the tour two things were very clear, our guide, Sunny, was both incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the subject and that we were in for a treat. The tour was great. She did a great job informing us all about HH Holmes and the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Our driver Brenda was also great, and even shared her own stories. We will certainly be back to try out the other tours!
