Terrific high end lodgings....classy without the  pretentiousness found at nearby hotels like the Peninsula.  NO TIPPING policy is a relief.  Super friendly staff in every corner of the hotel...the dates kiddo was treated with respect and fun.   Suites include a separate bedroom with bathroom.....separate powder bathroom was a nice touch for the dates kiddo to use.  Turn down service is excellent with the same high quality sheets making up the pullout couch as was on the king bed.  Nice house car with charming to take you nearby places.  Restaurant and bar prices not totally insane.  Kids menu is 1/2 price...but the same portions as the adult menu.
