Music to my ears: free upgrade! When I checked in here for a business trip this past Monday I was offered a king apartment suite, which turned out to be a very luxurious pad larger than many NYC apartments. The room was beautifully appointed in modern, minimal design, with a comfy dining nook where I set up shop with my laptop for a long night of presentation-building. This room had it all - two TVs, including 1 in the bedroom that was on an adjustable arm, a living room, dining nook, swank bathroom, large closet with bathrobe, complimentary carafe of triple-filtered water, wet bar, and one crazy-comfortable bed with high end linens. Service at this hotel was second to none. When I went wandering around the 4th floor for an ice machine and couldn't locate one, I returned to the room to call and inquire and they offered to send room service up with some ice for me. Thanks, guys! There is also complimentary wifi and a complimentary car shuttle service with a very posh SUV. The business center near the lobby provides free printing service and there are bikes in the lobby to borrow, also complimentary. All told this place has the best service of any hotel I've ever experienced, and I travel an awful lot for work. I almost wanted to stay another night just to enjoy being pampered. There was a bit of street noise in my room on the 4th floor, but I live in a major city and I'm a heavy sleeper, so it didn't really bother me, but those who aren't used to such things may want to request a room on a higher floor. Prices are comparable to other hotels in downtown Chicago but you get a 5-star experience. This place is a no-brainer. I will stay here every time I come to Chicago in the future.
