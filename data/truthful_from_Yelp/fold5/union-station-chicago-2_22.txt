Al Capone was having a bad day... "I want you to get this f*&% where he breathes! I want you to find this nancy-boy Eliot Ness, I want him DEAD! I want his family DEAD! I want his house burned to the GROUND! I wanna go there in the middle of the night and I wanna P*&# ON HIS ASHES!" Remember when Kevin Costner looked like the all-American jock ready to take on the world with his cracking voice and doofus grin? Then he drank his own urine in "Waterworld", and it was over. But before that ego-stricken meltdown, he played Robert Stack's old role of straight-arrow Eliot Ness in Brian DePalma's version of "The Untouchables". Good stuff, especially for that great if excessively contrived shootout scene in Union Station. Now that's frankly the only reason I came here after a belly-busting breakfast at Lou Mitchell's down the street. The staircase is not quite as grand as I expected, and I was hoping to see a young mother lugging her baby carriage up those steps. Didn't happen. It's a classically beautiful building once you enter on the Jackson Blvd. side with what looks to be a restaurant in the middle of the wide-open lobby area. Once you move right toward the actual station, it starts to take on the hustle-bustle of a standard commuter port with the long wooden benches and a pretty expansive food court upstairs. It's worth taking a look if you are a non-commuter. And just remember this comforting pearl of wisdom from Sean Connery... "You wanna know how you do it? Here's how... They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way, and that's how you get Capone! Now do you want to do that? Are you ready to do that?" And how can I leave you without a clip of the classic scene at Union Station...even though DePalma stole the idea from the Odessa Steps sequence in "The Battleship Potemkin"? youtube.com/watch?v=100Yâ€¦
