This is my go-to sightseeing in Chicago when someone comes to visit. Take the river and lake tour. It's beautiful on a nice day, has plenty of interesting information, and you get to see how the lock works. The viewed to the city are amazing on the river and you can see the whole skyline on the lake! I took both my parents here the other day and it was the perfect activity. We were able to sit and enjoy the sights, and it's much easier to get to than navy pier.
