We are professional worldwide travelers, weekly we are in some hotel in US, Europe, Asia, or South America, some are great properties and some hotels are just a place to sleep a night or two. We have learned that  'Over all'  the stay in a hotel  is Never about only the room or the amenities (which the Ritz Chicago was beautiful ) But it is ultimately about the EXPERIENCE. We came to Chicago for a rare weekend of R&R. Although the property was everything you expect from a RITZ, it was the 'over the top' friendliness of the staff that made our stay soooo memorable. The concierge Melissa Long was truly incredible professional as a member of Les Clefs d'Or. She was so kind and attentive acomplishing seemingly impossible task (like getting reservation at the Trump when everyone had said it was impossible ) but not for Ms.Long. She made us feel very special about our short stay in Chicago. In short, the old edage is still true. ...ONE person can make a difference. ...congratulations Ritz Chicago for making our visit a Great  Weekend !!! You are All to be commended for the impeccable  Professionalism. Thank you Ritz -Carlton Chicago for a memorable weekend beyond expectations!!! Dr.AntiAging
