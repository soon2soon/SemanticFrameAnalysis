One of the old greats.  It's a damn shame, but there's not that many of these beauts left in the United States.  The age of the railroad has been forever left in the dust by the age of the SUV. I've actually gotten dumped on one of those huge pew-like benches in the old waiting area, which is pretty funny.  The cathedral ceilings in the main old waiting area are reminiscent of other grand train stations in Washington D.C. and New York City.  I usually don't get to sit around and ponder their glory since I'm usually running through the concourse to the boarding tracks.   One of the best things about Union Station is their easy access to food and other amenities if you need to wait for a train.  Burrito Beach, Gold Coast Dogs, a Chinese restaurant, and a bar and grille are some of the options available for a snack.  There is also a convenience store near the food court. Located at Jackson and Canal Streets, Union Station is ironically kind of a pain to get to if getting there using the 'L'.  I usually take the Blue Line to Jackson and walk the few blocks.  There are definitely days in the winter when walking over the river (exposed to the elements) with your luggage is a huge pain in the ass.  So taking a cab for a few blocks might be worth the few dollars. In short, trains rule.
