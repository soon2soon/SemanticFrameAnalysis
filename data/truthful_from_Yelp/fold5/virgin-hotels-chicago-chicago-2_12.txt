Before we even entered the restaurant ,we were greeted warmly by the Easter staff outside.  Once entering, everyone was extremely helpful and gracious. They gave us a mini tour of both restaurants, and allowed us to take out time,  Once we went upstairs Mike gave us the history of the building and proceeded to have the Easter brunch around 2:00 pm - 2:30 pm. What can I say.....the food exceeded our expectations......especially the risotto. The service was of a Michelin rated restaurant. Our server Katie and Mike made the dining experience exceptional. Mike was spot on with the service,. He was meticulous about our needs. My boyfriend and I are definitely coming back for dinner.
