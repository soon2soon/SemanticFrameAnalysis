i love love love this tour! have been on it a few times since i used to travel to chicago quite a bit, and it's just so fun, especially on a gorgeous summer day with the sun on your face (not as good in the cold..) but honestly every experience has been awesome - the tour guides are super knowledgeable, and there is something new to learn every time. the route is beautiful, but then again chicago architecture along the river is really something else. Â everyone visiting chicago should do this - i've friends who've lived there for years and still go on this tour once in a while :)
