I have been on an airplane many times and have enjoyed virgin the most. I never fly first class, I'm just your regular person so review is strictly coach. Love that they have the tv on the headrest with free service to watch tv on the flight. Â Love that they have the free wifi on board. I like how you can chat with other travelers with the keyboard and screen. You can order food and drinks through the screen also. The service has always been exceptional. I mean really what else can you ask for? I have flown a few times with virgin now and hope to only fly with them if they are available.
