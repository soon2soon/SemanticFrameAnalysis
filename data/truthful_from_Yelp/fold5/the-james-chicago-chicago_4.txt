My husband and I, along with another couple who stayed in a different room, stayed at The James for 3 nights for our visit to Chicago. Great hotel. Very clean. Staff was accommodating to all of our needs. Concierge helped us with dinner reservations on two of our nights. Us ladies especially loved their shampoo, conditioner, and complimentary lotion!
