I have only used the spa rooms and was throughly impressed. Going in I had thought of gaudiness and superficial gaudiness. But I was pleasantly pleased to find it very relaxing and quite full of amenities. The tea room is quite serene. You can bring a magazine and have a nice collection of teas. Or you can take a nap. There os a lounge got everyone and also gender specific lounges. The interesting part is the men's has a TV and women's room does not. Both the sauna and steam room were perfect. The pool is quite nice; Large and spacious with enough width to do laps. I quite enjoyed the aloe mask that you can out on before the eucalyptus steam Room. Â They have a nice array of oils you can experiment with. Razors, creme, and hair girls are ample. Ask for the complimentary bathrobe and slippers. It will make you feel like royalty.
