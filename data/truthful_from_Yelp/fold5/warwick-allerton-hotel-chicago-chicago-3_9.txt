Wonderful hotel!! Got a great deal on Hotwire ($100 a night) and couldn't be happier. Reviews are correct as that rooms are small, but front desk, concierge and entire staff has been nothing but exemplary. Probably not the best family oriented hotel just due to the room size, but for a couple looking to get away and be in the heart of Chicago, I would highly recommend!!
