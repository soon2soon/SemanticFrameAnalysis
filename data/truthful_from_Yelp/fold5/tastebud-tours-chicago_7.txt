AWESOME! Neither my boyfriend nor I had ever been to Chicago, so we really didn't know where to go in the city. When I saw reviews for the Tastebud Tours I figured we'd give it a try.  Going on a Tastebud Tour was the BEST decision ever. We were able to get a tour of the city, learn about Chicago's history, meet the other guests in our group and find out what they recommended visiting, and we got to experience all of the signature Chicago foods in a short period of time.  It was nice getting to have a deep dish pizza and Chicago style hot dog without having to dedicate an entire meal to each dish.   Anna Lynn was our tour guide and she ROCKED.  She was so sweet and friendly, and super knowledgeable.  She kept the tour running smoothly without making anyone feel rushed. She was just a really cool, fun tour guide.   Thanks to Tastebud Tours having a tour in New Orleans, we will be traveling to NOLA for our next big vacation.  Tastebud Tours are the BEST way to get introduced to a new city!
