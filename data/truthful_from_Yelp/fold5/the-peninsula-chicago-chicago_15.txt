Let me preface my review with this... Chicago is AWESOME! This hotel was gorgeous and one of the nicest ones I've ever been to, period. They've got mood lighting in each bathroom, get the f outta here. This place is out of control nice! Everyone on staff was extremely attentive and the food at the restaurant near the lobby was good. But the point of my review, since you can read about all the other great stuff in the reviews below, Â is the fact that I got to scratch a wish off the ol' bucket list. I ran a bubble bath and watched the Steve Harvey show on the TV screen INSIDE the bathroom above the tub with mood lighting and all. Peninsula, you're the bomb!
