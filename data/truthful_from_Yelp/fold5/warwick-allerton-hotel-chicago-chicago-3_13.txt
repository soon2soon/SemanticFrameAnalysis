They upgraded our suite from a basic whatever petite package to a King Suite for free without us even asking! The customer service from the staff was amazing and gracious throughout our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is ready to explore the area on the Magnificent Mile, due to the amazing amenities, hotel staff, and the convenience of the location.
