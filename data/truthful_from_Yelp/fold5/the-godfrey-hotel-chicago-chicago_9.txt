This review is for the rooftop bar, more specifically what the wonderful staff did for me. I came here this past week (8/14) while looking for an upscale rooftop bar to end a fun night with some of my girlfriends. Good food, drinks, atmosphere... had a fun time, got a little tipsy..was about to pay for my drinks, ...credit card fell through the slats of deck. Just great.. I thought,, I guess I'll just have to call my bank in the morning to cancel it. Nope, staff said no worries, called their engineer(s), who spent about 30 whole minutes looking for my card through the wooden slats. Caused quite a scene as they had to take out some parts of the wood floor to retrieve it, I felt very foolish but could not stop thanking them after they did. Thank you again wonderful staff!
