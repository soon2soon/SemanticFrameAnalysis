This place is great!  We stayed in the Blue Line Suite for an extended weekend and had a great time.  With all the hotels in downtown Chicago, we wanted to stay near where we used to live, and having the options of staying in Wicker Park was great.   The train noise really isn't that bad, and if you are doing Chicago right, after you've had a few cocktails, you shouldn't even notice the noise.   I would totally stay here again and recommend it for anyone who'd rather stay in a fun part of town as opposed to downtown.
