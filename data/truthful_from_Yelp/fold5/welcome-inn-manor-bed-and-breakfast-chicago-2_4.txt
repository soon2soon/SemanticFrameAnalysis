In May 2014 we stayed at the Welcome Inn Manor for 5 nights on the second floor in the beautiful King Cole Quarters.  The accommodations were spacious and included 2 fireplaces and a sitting room in the bathroom. Mel and Angie are amazing Inn Keepers and made us feel so at home.  Mel never hesitated to drop us off and picked us up several times during our stay.  The breakfast was delicious and well presented.  If you want to treat yourself to a special place do not hesitate to stay at the Welcome Inn.  We plan a return visit and look forward to our next stay.
