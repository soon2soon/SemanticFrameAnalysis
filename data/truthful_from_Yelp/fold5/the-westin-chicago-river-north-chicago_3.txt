lemme preface this review by saying that...i have stayed at this westin a lot. A LOT. numerous instagrams and facebook posts are tagged at this westin... but, it's really a great hotel. not luxurious, but definitely business-y and is great for its category! from check in to getting keys to settling in and having free water bottles in the rooms, eveyrthing is very smooth. they're quick on satisfying needs if you forgot a hair brush or tooth brush. and the gym is super nice! lots of treadmills and weight equipment - and the attendant is GREAT, and offers personal fitness consults! AMAZING! Â  honestly though, nothing to complain about and the perfect place to stay when traveling on business :) centrally located and all!
