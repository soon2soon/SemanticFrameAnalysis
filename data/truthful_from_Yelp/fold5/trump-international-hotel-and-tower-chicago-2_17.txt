Decided on a quick last minute trip and decided to go all out on this trip. They arranged to have a car pick us up from Ohare Airport, which was the start of a pleasant stay at the Trump. Trump was our first choice since I stay at the one in New York and have always had a great experience.  The room views are amazing, you can see the entire city all the way to the Navy Pier and it's in the heart of Chicago, right next to the Loop, whatever you need is literally steps away from your door.  They're were some minor downfall such as the spa treatment prices were beyond extreme.  The bathroom has a tv in the mirror which was great, but as your soaking in the tub you barely got a view of it, you could only listen.  They could also have more elevators installed since the Hotel has long time residents residing, which can cause a long wait trying to get to some floors.     They had a courtesy Escalade with a driver to take you to the location you requested which was an extra convenient for the group of people we had staying there.      I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance, the staff go above and beyond your typical hotels near by which make the stay more pleasant, see you soon Trump!
