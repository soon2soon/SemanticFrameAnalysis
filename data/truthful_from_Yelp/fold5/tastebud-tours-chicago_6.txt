So fun!!! Local Chicagoan, Keith, did a great job entertaining us with personal stories, historical information and awesome food. As this was our first visit to the city, we were most anxious to try some regional cuisine and we were not disappointed. The tour began with deep dish pizza at Pizanos and included a Chicago style hot dog, gumbo from Heaven on Seven, a cheeseburger from The BillyGoat Tavern and more. Even a surprise torrential downpour was taken in stride. Keith procured 2 cabs, bought some umbrellas "just in case", Â and we arrived at our next stop dry. (I so appreciated this thoughtfulness--hope he's reimbursed!!) Definitely a fun way to explore a new place!!
