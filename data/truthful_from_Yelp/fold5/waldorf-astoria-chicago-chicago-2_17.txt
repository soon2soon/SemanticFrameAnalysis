Casey and Sandra and the rest of the staff made our stay in Chicago excellent beyond words . This hotel really knows what they are doing when It comes to hiring . There are not many places where a staff member will follow up to every single request until they know their guest is happy . I wish I could give more than 5 stars !!! The hotel is beautiful , classy and luxurious , very nice views of Chicago
