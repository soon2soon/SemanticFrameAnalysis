I stayed in the Garden Apartment in Aug '13 for my birthday & it was amazing. Perfect location and staff was beyond nice & helpful. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Check in was quick. The street the B&B is on is beautiful & quiet & a very short walk to all the action on Damen & Milwaukee. I visit Chicago often & will only stay here on my future visits.
