Bar none the best service I've ever experienced at a hotel -- from the bartenders to the check-in counter people to the information desk woman (who actually offered to make me coffee at 5 am if the complimentary lounge coffee wasn't out there yet). Rooms were super quiet and comfortable and stylish. Excellent!
