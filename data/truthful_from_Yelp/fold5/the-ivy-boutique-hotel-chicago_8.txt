We had a king suite. The room was clean beautiful and very spacious. The bathroom had a shower with a rainforest head, separate tub, a her/his sink, and a tv embedded on the mirror. The living room had a large sofa, big screen, two tables and a separate purple velvet seat. There was also a large screen tv in front of the king bed as well. I loved this room! It was a hidden gem and only a block away from the shopping on magnificent mile.
