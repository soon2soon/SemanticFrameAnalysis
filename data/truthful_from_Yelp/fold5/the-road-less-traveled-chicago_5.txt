Our 14 year old son's trip to Costa Rica was a life changing experience.  In his words, "I had the time of my life".   He loved all aspects of the trip from the hard work rehabbing a school, living in a tent, learning to surf, seeing the smiles on the children's faces when they saw their school upgraded school, and of course the famous oatmeal mixed with peanut butter for breakfast.  He gained a more worldly perspective and a broader appreciation of his own life.   The trip exceeded his expectations and ours.  RLT is an awesome organization and team that is truly making a difference.
