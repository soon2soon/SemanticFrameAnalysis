Had a fantastic experience at theWit on a trip a couple weeks ago. Stayed on the 26th floor in a suite with a friend on a "Ladies Getaway" weekend, and I'm already dying to go back. The staff is seriously amazing. Everyone was extremely helpful and accommodating. The hotel itself is chic and trendy, bed was super comfy, and food was great (we ordered room service a couple of times and ate at State & Lake for breakfast). The Roof bar is sexy, sexy, sexy. Great club atmosphere late in the evening.
