I love the location.  Easy to get to Navy Pier, the shoreline, shopping, restaurants, parks and the river cruises.   It's a three-sided structure, so you might want to look at Google Earth to get an idea of the potential views.  The lake view is a no-brainer, but watching the river traffic and bridge operations is interesting, too. Comfortable, spacious rooms, good food and friendly and helpful staff.   My stays there go by in a blur, because the hotel succeeds in making them a relaxing experience.  No question, I'll go back.
