The Ivy was so beautiful and accomodating. I went for my birthday and had the best time. Right once we checked in, they sent up complimentary chocolate covered strawberries and wine unexpectedly as a bday gift. The room was clean, and I had the best bubble bath of my life in the tub. The beds were so comfortable and the purple theme was too cute. I felt like a princess. The tv in the bathroom mirror is ballin'. Thank you, The Ivy & staff!
