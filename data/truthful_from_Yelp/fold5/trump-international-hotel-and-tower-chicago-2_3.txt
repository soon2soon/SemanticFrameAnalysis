The suite we had at the Trump was one of the finest I've had anywhere. The rooms are huge, there's a full kitchen, a "fireplace" and spectacular views of the river. Just as spectacular was the front desk service, which was friendly rather than stiff, yet superbly professional. The location of the hotel couldn't be better, and the room pricing was extremely reasonable. This is the place I'm recommending to all our Chicago visitors.
