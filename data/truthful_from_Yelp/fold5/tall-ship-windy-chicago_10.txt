I got a groupon for the tall ship windy while looking for something fun to do with my visiting sister and niece. I surprised them with the cruise at 5:45 and it was THE BEST way to end the day. We sat up front and had the best guide. He was hilarious and a little sassy, but good sass. :) We could really tell the guides loved interacting with the guests. A few of the boys hung out up front trying to impress my niece with their rope tying and throwing skills. They were charming everyone and it really added to the trip. At one point a little girl sitting next to us asked her mom and dad "can we go home now?" !! Our young guide pulled out a rope handcuff puzzle that kept her completely entertained and made her feel very special. This trip was worth it for the views, and a great experience on a tall ship! Thanks Windy! I will be back!!
