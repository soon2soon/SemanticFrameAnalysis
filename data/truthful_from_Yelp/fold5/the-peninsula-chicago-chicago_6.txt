I can rough it just as much as the next guy -- I once went camping for 3 days 2 nights in a tent, hiking around with a 40 pound pack on my back, answering nature's call ... in nature, not showering, and coming home up to my neck in chigger bites, after all. Every once in a while though, it feels amazing to live luxuriously. The Peninsula is truly top-of-the-line. As soon as we set foot in front of the entrance, there was a door man who greeted us while spinning the revolving door. Immediately, everything from the decor to the service made me feel like royalty. What girl doesn't want to be made to feel like a princess? Our hotel room was spacious: there were random unnecessary (but oh-so very necessary) hallways here and there and the bathroom was absolutely humongous with double shower heads and just a lot of empty floor space. The TV in our bedroom area was about a 50 inch and swung out to face the bed. There was also a second TV in the bathroom for when you're on the throne or by the sink. The towels and robes were large and fluffy. The bed was comfy and appeared clean to me. There was a sitting room with a couch up against the window and a spectacular view of the city. Room service was able to provide us with materials for ironing and generously filled toiletry bags. While at dinner, we were discussing making a trip to the nearest convenience store to pick up some water, however upon return to our room, we found that room service had stopped by while we were out to provide us with complimentary water bottles. We were on a tight schedule that weekend; I'm sad that I didn't have a chance to check out the pool that I'd heard so much about or the numerous high end restaurants within the hotel building. Overall, I was, and continue to be, blown away. This is an impressive hotel at a great location. I'm overcome with happiness and a feeling of tranquility just thinking back even... Oh, the good life!
