Couple from Toronto - I surprised my boyfriend with a Wendella Boat Tour and he loved it. If you're into history and architecture, you're in for a treat! We bought our tickets online a week before and in doing so we saved 5% on each ticket. We were supposed to go for our tour on a Saturday afternoon but the came down hard. Fortunately we were able to call Wendella and without complications we were able to switch to the following morning! Our tour guide was born and raised in Chicago, and was very passionate about showing us his city. He was also very funny and super knowledgeable, making the tour fun and enjoyable. We couldn't believe how beautiful the buildings were and how much history there was in the making and refurbishing in many of them. He also gave us a lot of fun facts too! It lasted for approximately 75 mins but it went by fast. If you happen to take a tour, bring some water with you in case you get hot as it is an open roof boat. It's a good time! GO!
