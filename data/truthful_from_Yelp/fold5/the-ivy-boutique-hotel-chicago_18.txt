Stunning little hotel. Amazing modern king suite that was both extra large and tastefully decorated. Staff was very friendly, attentive and personable. Excellent location. Loved the rooftop terrace. We visited the terrace both during the day and at night! Great drinks, great staff, great views and stylish. We will definitely stay here again! Highly recommend!!!!
