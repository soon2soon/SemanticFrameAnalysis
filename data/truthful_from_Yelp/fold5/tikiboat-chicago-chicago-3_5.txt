I LOVE THIS BOAT! Ive been on this boat twice now. Each year we go for my girlfriend's birthday. 3 words: IT'S A BLAST! It's a two level, party animal, smashing good pontoon type boat. They allow you to bring your own beer and food. They have a grill on board, TVs, and speakers to blast some tunes. It is so affordable. Split it 12 ways along your friends and everyone can bring some drinks and what not. They are docked at Monroe harbor and its best to just cab it there with all of your stuff. Once you arrive to the boat, Brian and Pablo will greet you. They are very personable and polite, such great guys! One of them will accompany your voyage as your captain and will most likely be sharing some laughs with ya! They do NOT drink on the boat with you clearly because they are driving, which is good. Once all of the passengers are on the boat you guys can ship out to a scenic route or straight to the playpen to party. I always prefer the latter :-) Once out there,  you can dock.. and let the festival beginnnnnnn! They have got a slide on the top level that goes right into the water. It's hilarious.  Often people will swim over from other boats and want to go down the slide. its up to you whether you can be a party booper pooper or just climb up and slide down! All in all, this boat is something everyone should do. It is insanely fun and a perfect way to celebrate a hot summer day in Chicago. If you go, tell them Paul sent yA! :-) p.s. there is a toilet on board, and it is clean. another crucial part of the boat ha.
