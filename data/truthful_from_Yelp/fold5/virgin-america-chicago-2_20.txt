I refuse to fly any other airline when Virgin has a route to my destination.  The fares are ridiculously cheap for the amenities. Leather seats, satellite TV, google maps to show where you  are, games, music, great food/drink options (for a price, besides coffee/sodas).  I RARELY am ever delay and I fly them about once a month.  And it is never their fault, but weather delays.  The best of the best.
