Was stuck in Chicago on a recent layover and stayed at the Swissotel. What a nice surprise. Great service on several levels, from the doorman, the front desk, housekeeping and management - everyone I dealt with was professional and courteous - all made me feel welcome and appreciated. Room was well appointed, bed extremely comfortable, shower and tub both in the large bathroom. After the long day I had had I just wanted a nice place to rest for the night and I found it here. Stopped by the lounge area bar for a cold beer and a late bite to eat, after getting settled into my room it was well past 10:30 pm - the bar tender was accommodating and friendly and made sure I got both even with the late hour the kitchen was open till midnight, which I really appreciate - the beer was great and the food good. All in all this hotel overall made me feel like they were glad I was there and with as many hotels as there are in town to choose from this was important to me. Just a few blocks from the water and plenty of things within walking distance. They even gave me a late check out time when I asked with no questions when I explained that my travel connection was not until late the next day. Housekeeping stopped by my room after noon and realized I was still there, told me no worry sir we will come back and to take my time. Compared to the average price of a Chicago hotel this place is a bargain and a real gem. 5 stars. 00032
