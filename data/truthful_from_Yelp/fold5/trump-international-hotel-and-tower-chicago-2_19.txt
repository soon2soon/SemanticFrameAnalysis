Third stay here again, and I just love it.  I got a SPA Grand Deluxe room this time, thought I would try a different style room this time.  It was as luxurious and plush as before, but these types of rooms don't have the benefits of the kitchen/kitchenettes. BUT...they do have spectacular bathrooms!    DEEP, and I said DEEP soaking tub, the deepest tub I have ever laid in.  Wonderful lotions, potions, creams, bath salts, body butter, watch TV while laying in the abyss of a luxurious DEEP soaking bath. (Have I said DEEP enough yet?) And the view,  I think these view ARE Chicago.  Michigan Ave is right outside your window.  Boats going by, birds flying by...the city is there for the taking. The staff here is wonderful and actually seem happy to help you in any way.
