No visit to Chicago is complete until taking a boat tour through the city.  Wendella offers two main tours: (1) architecture tour which takes you through the city of Chicago; and (2) architecture AND Lake Michigan tour which also takes you out on the lake.  You MUST do the combo architecture tour and Lake Michigan tour to get the breath-taking view of the Chicago skyline from the lake. The departure location is smack dab in the middle of downtown at the Michigan street bridge with all the flags.  They have a Wendella sign and attendant at the top of the steps that will guide you down.  There are different departure locations for each tour so be sure to check with the attendant before heading down. Combo tour was $30/head (I think it's slightly cheaper if you buy online). Once on the boat, there's seating on the top deck, downstairs in the cabin, and downstairs along the sides.  If sitting at top, it's a good idea to bring a hat, sunglasses, and sunblock.  One of the cool things about these boats is the full bar downstairs! Our tour narrator was a little funny but very knowledgeable.  There's no bad seat on the top deck.  Be prepared for a lot of looking up.  BF and I actually got out of our seats and went downstairs once we got out on the lake.  We were out on the lake for the majority of the tour, taking lots of pics of the beautiful skyline. Well worth the $30 for this tour.  They also offer a sunset tour and other special tours as well.  They take your picture before boarding and you can purchase at the end of the ride for $20.  We were suckered into it like the typical tourist.  I'd definitely recommend this tour for Chicago tourists.
