This hotel is excellent.  I had taken an overnight bus to Chicago, so I arrived around 6:30am at the front desk.  The woman at the front desk did everything she could to accommodate the request of a higher floor, for the view, and not too close to the elevator at such an early hour.  Since check-in isn't until 3:00pm, I didn't expect to get a room so early in the morning, but she somehow worked her magic and went from from telling us we could leave our bags and they'd call us when our room was ready to getting us the perfect room. The location is excellent, which is conveniently located to many shopping areas and a few different lines on the L.  The view we had overlooking the river was gorgeous.  The angle and location of the hotel, is just so, that the river bends right where the hotel is, so you get a perfect view down the river. The room was a good size and had all the basic amenities.  The bed was comfortable and bathroom was great.  Wi-Fi worked flawlessly and had no issues throughout the stay. Overall, an easy reason to see why it's a 4-star hotel. The only complaint I have, is whoever does scheduling really puts a lot of responsibilities on the doorman.  He had to flag taxis, greet guests, help them with luggage, take the luggage to their room, and check their luggage for guests who wished to have their luggage held after check out.  I couldn't believe how busy he was, and I saw a lot of guests getting impatient.  During busy check out and check in times, they really need more people working the front.
