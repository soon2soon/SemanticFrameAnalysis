My curiosity got to me.  I used to be into biking but I hurt my back a few years ago, which has limited my mobility.  WanderBikes has 5 or 6 electric bike models for sale (cargo and mountain bike style) and a bunch of electric bikes for rent.  I thought renting a few bikes is a creative date idea so this review is for the rental experience. I met the two owners.  Since I've never ridden an e-bike, I was eager to try it first.  They we're insightful, helpful and walked me through an orientation.  I was able to demo both of the rental models and the bikes were really simple to operate.  Basically you just need to be able to ride a normal bike.  They have access to a quiet road behind the store where I quickly fell in love with bikes all over again.  10 minutes later I made my decision and arranged for a delivery later in the week. 24 hrs before delivery, I got a call confirming the drop off time and my address (much appreciated).  On the day of, they show up (on time) and unload the bikes.  As for the experience and to make a long story short, we had an absolute blast!  Brunch in North Center, picnic at the lake and a movie in the park all sum up a great day.  I was sad to see them go but I'll rent again. Good guys, friendly, prompt, and have a fun product that was new to us.  Most of all, the girlfriend was impressed and had a really good time.  5 stars because of the experience, delivery and overall service.
