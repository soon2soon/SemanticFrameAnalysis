I love playing tourist in Chicago! With the daily routine of: bus, el, walk, work, fight with the wind, fight with the rain, battle the heat, glare at slow walking picture takers, sigh, roll eyes, iPod on, sunglasses on, head down,I don't have any change, I don't want to buy anything. It's kind of hard sometimes to stop and just enjoy the city. Tastebud tours is a great way to spend some time walking around, exploring the city, learning more about the history,visiting famous locations and of course sampling great food. Lynn is an excellent guide who knows a lot about the culture and the history of the city and the dining destinations. He seemed very open to suggestions and I think he is gearing up to make an already fabulous tour even bettter.So whether you're visiting Chicago for the first time or you've lived here for 50 years do yourself a favor and take your taste buds on a tour of Chicago...see what I did there? :) Enjoy!
