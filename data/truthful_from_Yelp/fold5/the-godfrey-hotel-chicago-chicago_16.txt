Celebrated my birthday here at the io urban Roofscape Â and proud to say that it was a very good time. Everyone was very professional and welcoming. Robert, who was at the entrance, greeted and serviced us very polite and in a professional way. The lounge was two thumbs up. Bartenders were awesome. Overall a very great time. Been to a lot of lounges and bars downtown but Godfrey is on the top of my list. Beautiful view as well.
