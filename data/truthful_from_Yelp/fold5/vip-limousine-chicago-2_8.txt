I used this company to pick up my niece, her friend and their daughters who were going to a concert downtown Chicago. As they are not from a very small town, I was, naturally, concerned about their safety so the car was hired. The driver was not only on time but the car was stocked, he told them exactly where he would be and kept in touch with them via text the entire time to make sure they were ok and not lost..which was above and beyond anything I expected.... but it eased my mind when I was talking to her (I was out of town) and she said, "Our driver is texting us again to make sure we're on the right path". They all loved the personality of the driver and had an AWESOME time...! He took them from point A to point B safely, which gave me peace of mind! I ended up tipping the driver again for taking such good care of them! I would highly recommend this company! If I could figure out how to post the photo the girls sent me from inside the car...smiling, laughing and just having the best time... I would! This service is worth every penny and then some!
