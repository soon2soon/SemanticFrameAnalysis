********************* 1108 ********************      On my last day of this trip to Chicago, I moved to the Thompson, because I wanted to check out what is new with them, since I previously stayed at this same location, but it was former Sutton Place Hotel, where my previous work had me stayed here many times.    I remember the previous manager Amala, a really sweet and nice lady on my last stay at Sutton Place, about a year ago. She said this hotel would shut down and remodeled. I didn't know it would changed the brand too.    Thompson is quite a nice and chic brand, 60 Thompson Street in Manhattan with chef Kittchai Thai restaurant back in the day, 10 years ago, was such a hot spot with roof top view of NYC.    Then Thompson Beverly Hills, and now Chi Town. A lot had changed since, the lobby lounge is swanky, chic, and good vibe.  The front desk check in is still small.  The lobby lounge is comfortable couches, books, and plenty of picture frames on the walls.     What used to be the Whiskey Bar now a new Italian restaurant Nico Osteria is ONE OFF HOSPITALITY GROUP which owns Black Bird, Avec, The Violet Hour, The Publican and Big Star in Chicago.      Thompson Chicago sits at the intersection of State Street and Rush Street, steps from Michigan Avenue's shopping, Oak Street's boutiques and downtown's dining and nightlife. The Gold Coast hotel overlooks the vast blue expanse of Lake Michigan and boasts views of the city's sparkling skyline from many of its 247 rooms.       I checked in and the manager Amala was there to greet me and she remembers me, that's amazing. This is the kind of hospitality will bring clients back for more. She upgraded me to the suite, THANK YOU.     My suite was big, bathtub, shower with modern rain showerheads (reminds me of the Bellagio spa),  a nice couch, luxurious velvet sofas,  ,and upscale bath and spa products by REN. The bed was comfortable, and I love the Small and Large slippers for his & her in black :-)      Complimentary luxury car service when I need to be drop off nearby, and 24-hour in-room dining (reminds me of Vegas), the doorman is extremely nice and polite. I never once had to open the door in 24 hours staying here :-)    Came from 4 nights at the Four Seasons, to this swanky chic hotel, I didn't expect much, but Thompson Chicago surely exceed the hospitality, customer service, and too the restaurant Nico Osteria, from the front desk to the doorman, to from the bartender to the hostess, I was impressed.    I was glad that I decided to check in for even just 1 night, I could compared the former Sutton Place and now Thompson, what a pleasure. I'm looking forward to return soon. Thank you.
