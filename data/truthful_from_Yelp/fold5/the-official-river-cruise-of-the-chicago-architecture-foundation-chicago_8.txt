I really enjoyed this tour of Chicago's architecture, as experienced from the river. The volunteer docent on the 90 minute trip was a professional architect who provided great insight into the history and design of the buildings. I had been expecting a recitation of architect's names and dates, but this was much more, and much more interesting. I came away feeling I'd really learned a lot about the how and why of development in the city, and had a good time doing it. It's nice that there are outside seats on the top deck and bow to accommodate everyone, so you can see the view, but also that there is an inside cabin and bar, in case it rains (which it did!)
