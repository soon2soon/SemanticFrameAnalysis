A Metra ride ending at Union the other day reminded me I'd hadn't yet reviewed the Station so I'm correcting that now. There's something about riding that escalator up, slowly from the metra stations below , and staring up up up at the Tower above you that is just too cool for words.   What's to review, right?  It's just a train a station?  What interest does it have to the Gravestomper?   No, it's not just a train station: it's an underground hideaway for dark and spooky things...at least it is in my imagination.  And since my husband once worked on the place late at night and confirmed there were underground sections, I now am positive the legions of the undead make their home beneath it... I have spent more time people watching here...I read huge chunks of the Harry Potter series here, years ago when I taught at DePaul in the loop. It's been the starting point to many a fantastic evening.   And there's nothing cooler than standing out front of the place on a cool autumn night, fall breeze blowing through your hair, jazz on your headphones while you lean on the rail above the river and stare Up Up Up at the skyscrapers... Love that there are trains in this city.  Love that you can cruise them from one end of the suburbs to the heart of the city.  Love that this station is there and that it's so easy to find so you can tell people: meet me on the steps where Eliot Ness tried to catch the baby carriage.... There's such a romance to the place: people coming and going from all over (Maybe I read too much Ayn Rand in my youth).  Movement and possibility and all that activity...Strangers could meet and fall in love between trains and then whisk out of each others' lives forever. There's always the possibility of being anyone or anything when you're traveling: all rules, all limits are off when you're a stranger on a busy platform. Shway, man!
