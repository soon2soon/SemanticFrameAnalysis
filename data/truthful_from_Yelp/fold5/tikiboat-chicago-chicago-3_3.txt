A friend asked me if I wanted to join in some Memorial Day festivities out on Lake Michigan via the TikiBoat and given the gorgeous weather, I could not turn an offer like that down.  The boat is docked at Monroe Harbor and is a two-floor festive party machine - spacious room in the front and back of the lower level, and a second level (accessed by ladder) that has a PARTY SLIDE off of it.  Yes you read that right - there is a slide from the 2nd level that launches your carefree and joyful body straight into Lake Michigan.  The bathroom is spotless (which was a big concern of mine initially), and there is a fridge and a cooler to store you party beverages and snacks.  You can even grab some brats and buns on the way to the boat party because there is an actual little grill you can make your delectables right on board. When we were on board, our captain, Pablo, was super friendly, very professional, and asked us if we wanted to go along the Chicago River or out onto the Lake to an area called the 'Play Pen' - a shallower spot on the lake where the water is warmer (not that we were swimming that day - Lake Michigan in May after our arctic winter?  No thank you hypothermia.) and much calmer.  We opted for the Play Pen and had a fantastic time drinking, eating, soaking up the sun, and listening to our music (which nicely hooks up to the stereo system they have on board). All in all - I found the TikiBoat to be the ultimate vessel for our fun Memorial Day celebrations - it truly could not have been a more perfect day.  Thank you Pablo and TikiBoat Chicago!!!
