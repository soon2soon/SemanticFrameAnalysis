My friend and I stayed at this hotel two weeks ago! It was a "girls" weekend. Perfect location as it is just steps from Michigan Ave. We had a beautiful room with a really nice sitting area. The rain shower is heavenly! Two sinks and a huge bathtub! I huge TV in each room - and one in the mirror in the bathroom. A fav feature I usually find in Vegas hotel rooms. The staff was incredible! They always greeted us like we were friends. And Albert and Anna were amazing! They went above and beyond for us. Thank you!! The rooftop bar was a great spot as well! Def would have drinks there again! Will definitely stay here again when I am back in Chicago!
