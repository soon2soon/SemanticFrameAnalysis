This place is going to ruin me for all other hotels!  I'm a frequent business traveler - on the road 3 out of every 4 weeks. The loyalty club doesn't give you points, but instead makes your stay as personal as possible. I walked into my room to find my favorite snacks and drinks.   The rooms are immaculate and well designed.  The staff has been very helpful and courteous.  The mini bar is stocked at street prices, not hiked up.  The wifi is fast and free.  The bed is one of the softest hotel beds I've been in.  And best of all, it costs less than a lot of it's neighbors.   The food at the Commons Club is great - although a bit of a challenge for a picky eater.  And if you're a hotel guest, there's a happy hour with an open bar! I wish I could stay in a Virgin hotel in every city and town that I travel to!
