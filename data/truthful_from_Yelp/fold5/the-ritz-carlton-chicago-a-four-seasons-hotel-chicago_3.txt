What do you do when the weather is sub-zero and freezing outside???? Stay indoors and receive a heavenly massage :) My husband treated the both of us to a couple's massage and manicure. The massage was wonderful, and the manicurist was a great conversationalist. I love the fruit infused water and the selection of coffee/teas/apples/nuts they had in the waiting room. My husband and I wanted to go for a swim, but forgot to bring our swim suits. However, they immediately acted upon our concern and provided us disposable swim suits to wear for the day. What incredible service!!
