So I went on my first tour on weird Chicago with a bunch of my girlfriends on Halloween. Our tourist was Jennifer & she was AWESOME!!!! She took us to places & would give us details to how everything happened and would pretend with some of the passengers on the bus to be that specific person we were talking about. She made us feel like we were there. Now it is true that when the tourist tells you to take pictures, don't just take one. Take a few back to back so you can see if anything did or did not appear. However, if you don't see a ghost or anything appear in your photos. Not everyone does. Some of the things she was guiding us with kind of put some goosebumps to myself. What freaked me out the most was the Congress Hotel :-X ....... Over all experience I would say to try it out & learn about the historics on Chicago. It's only $30 and they give you a tour for almost 3 hours which is not bad. They do let you take food on the bus which is a plus :) .... I went on a crazy cold Halloween day and Jennifer would tell us part of the story so that we wouldn't have to be outside in the cold to long.
