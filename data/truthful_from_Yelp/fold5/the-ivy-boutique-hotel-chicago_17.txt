Though at $350, Â this hotel cost more than I've ever paid for a hotel stay, it was worth every penny. I've never had a better experience and wished I lived at a hotel, the way I did at the IVY. Every detail was covered, and our stay was tremendous. When we walked up to the reception desk, we were greeted by two extraordinarily friendly gentlemen who offered to point out our location on a map, give dinner or clubbing suggestions, and even provided my boyfriend band aids for the blisters he'd earned on our walk through Chicago. Our room wasn't huge, but I understood that it would be more on the "cozy" side when I booked it. The bed was so good that we took the details in case we wanted to order it. I slept so insanely well, which partially had to do with having my handsome boyfriend sharing the bed with me, but mostly to do with the bed. The shower was nothing short of heavenly. It had a large rain shower head and the floor must have been made from unpolished granite or some other kind of hard stone that drained underneath. An amazing touch was the little bites of dessert that were dropped off by a sweet lady, who also filled our ice bucket for us. Top notch hotelling!!!!
