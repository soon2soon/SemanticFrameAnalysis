Virgin is the best airlines in the U.S.  I cant wait until they put the other airlines out of business.  They know how to consistently service their customers and the planes are modern, up to date, and comfortable.  I was on the first flight out of ORD to SFO and have been hooked ever since.  I just wish they grow faster so I can get more routes out of ORD.
