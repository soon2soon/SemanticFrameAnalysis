5 star service. Free drinks upon arrival because our room wasn't ready. We attempted to tip our valet but he told us that "tip isn't necessary", which was extremely professional for a hotel of this caliber.  The brunch was delectable.  The steak and eggs were the best I've ever had.   The suite was fantastic.  Beautiful views of the John Hancock and the lake.  My partner and I made great use of the balcony with a few glasses of champagne.  I wish we would have used the fireplace.  The bathroom was spacious and the large tub was perfect for soaking in.   I'm not sure how they knew that my partner and I were together, but after we returned from dinner, our room had a walkway and a heart on our bed made of rose petals.  Honestly it was the best hotel service I have ever had.  My partner was ecstatic when she saw this and thought that I had arranged this.   Cannot wait to stay here again!
