Stayed at the Whitehall while attending a conference in Chicago (Sept 2014) - great experience. Spent 4 nights in room 2101 (top floor) with great views and good service. The hotel definitely has character and a better vibe than the giant hotel that the conference was being held in. Check in and out was smooth and quick. I was a little worried about the two small elevators but during my 4 night stay no issues with that. Had a drink in the attached restaurant which was fine, did not try the food. Super location, easy to get cabs, and shopping surrounds the hotel. Had nice interactions with the staff, would recommend to people wanting a boutique hotel in central location. Ask for the high floor!
