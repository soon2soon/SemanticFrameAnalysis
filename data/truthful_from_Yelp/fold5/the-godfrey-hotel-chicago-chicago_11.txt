I just stayed here for two nights and had a fantastic time!  This is a sleek, post-modern glitzy hotel with a continental touch!  Located in downtown Chicago's bustling Rivernorth neighborhood,  the architecture of the building is bold and  striking. The front desk and concierge staff were friendly and accommodating at every opportunity,  as was the doorman and valet. The sleek marble lobby with its gorgeous lighting and contemporary furniture was gorgeous. An element of industrial style carried throughout the hotel, using machined metal and muted color mixed with blinged finishes. Very spacious room, handsomely decorated in greys,  creams, and deep purple.  Very luxurious feeling with lots of space, a mini bar (just call concierge for the complimentary fridge - it takes 5 minutes! ) I loved the bed! Absolutely heavenly mattress,  luxe linens and pillows. I slept like a baby! The large bathroom had a nice frameless glass shower but no tub.  The double vanity was nice. For such a new (3 month old) hotel they really have their act together. Housekeeping could use a bit more training though. They failed to restock essentials. One phone call cleared that up. I will be reviewing their 4th floor I/O Urban Roofscape bar/club/restaurant in a separate review.  I highly recommend this access to everything,  brand new unique hotel!
