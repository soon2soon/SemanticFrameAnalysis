I am a 59 year old male Chicago resident. My 53 year old sister from Boulder came to visit and made reservations with Wateriders. We had a fabulous time on the architecture tour. It was just the right amount of paddling -- we did a double kayak -- and architecture talk. I've been on several walking and boat architecture tours and this one was my favorite. The owner of the company, a former Chicago business Real Estate broker owns the company and HE gave the tour. Funny, poetic and really knowledgeable about Chicago history, he shared lots of great info with us about the region, the buildings and the people who lived near the river in the 1800s. Highly recommended to those of you who want an alternative way to experience the city for 2.5 hours, breathe in some fresh air, get some exercise and find out why the Chicago River smells like chocolate. Great photo opps too!
