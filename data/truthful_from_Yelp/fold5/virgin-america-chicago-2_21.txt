An AMAZING airline to fly!! It was the best coach class flight I've ever experienced. They had TV's in every single seat on the airplane where you could watch FREE TV (essentially basic cable), order on-demand movies AND order anything on the menu INCLUDING the free beverages. You could also check where you are on a Google map during the flight. They also had free on-demand MP3's to listen to if you wanted some music to enjoy. I even liked their uber-cute instructional video at the beginning of the flight. The flight attendants were extremely friendly and good humored. They also had wifi on the plane to buy or you could check out a Google laptop which you would drop off at your destination and with this you get free wifi. I couldn't have asked for anything more with this airline. Sir Richard Branson BRAVO and thank you for bringing your airline to Chicago!! Flying Virgin America made me feel like an actual human being and I didn't have to fly first class to do so. Wow, I can't wait to fly them again!!! :)
