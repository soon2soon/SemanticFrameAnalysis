Ooooooooooh, i love this place! It's on Wicker Park street and in the heart of Wicker park, but trying to find is a bit confusing and to be honest I find that quite charming! It's almost feels like ur in a small quaint lil' town. The inn it self is very well kept. It's obvious that the decor for each room was thought out with care and dedication. The eating area has such a warm and comfy vibe to it, which is great for people who are in from out town!! I would def. recommend it! Also the GM David is a sweet heart and truly helpful! Recap: Great location, Beautifully decorated and the service is wonderful!!
