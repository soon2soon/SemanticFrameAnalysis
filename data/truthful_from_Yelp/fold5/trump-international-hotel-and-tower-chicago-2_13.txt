I was lucky enough to get to stay at the Trump because of a conference for work, and wow...first class all the way.  I'm usually exceptionally critical when I review places that are popular or trendy etc, but I can't find much to deduct points for on the Trump Hotel.  The deluxe guest room is fantastic.  They are large in size, have a full kitchenette, an outstanding bathroom (mirror tv included) and every bell and whistle you could possibly imagine.  Everything down to electronically retracting curtains, to one touch lighting control, and a Bose premium bedside radio.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful, and makes you feel first class all the way.  If you have the means and availability, I would highly recommend staying at the Trump.   Side note, if you are staying at the hotel, they have a Terrace Cafe on the 16th floor that has an amazing view and you can eat outside 16 floors up.
