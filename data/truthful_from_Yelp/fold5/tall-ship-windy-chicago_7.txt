I booked a 16 person block for my department outing and things couldn't have gone smoother. I used the groupons with drink tickets and redeemed the vouchers on their website. I brought the printed tickets and proof of drink tickets and that seemed to help the cashier a lot. The photographer was even able to get all of us in a souvenir shot! The ship itself is gorgeous and the tour affords amazing views. The bar kept my executive and team well lubricated along the way. The docent in pirate garb was a riot and did a great job at entertaining folks on the lower deck (drinking means you don't remember what you learned about helms and decks and such). If you're in the market for a lake outing I highly recommend Tall Ship Windy for everything from their knowledgable customer service to their beer cooler that fills cups from the bottom. I will likely look them up for another tour soon.
