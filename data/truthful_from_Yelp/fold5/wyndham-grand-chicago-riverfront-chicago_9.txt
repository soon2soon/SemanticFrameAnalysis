I just spent 5 days here and really have no major complaints.  The hotel is in a prime location!  Especially for a 1st timer in Chi-town trying to visit all the major tourist spots.  It's walking distance to Millennium Park, Magnificent Mile, Willis Tower, Giordano's pizza and close to various train/bus routes if you'd like to venture out. Getting here from O'Hare airport was very easy.  Just hop on the Blue Line going to Forest Park, purchase a single rider ticket for $5 and it's about a 40 minute train ride.  Once you exit it's about a 5 min walk to the hotel.  I had considered getting a shuttle to the hotel, but after seeing the traffic on the freeway I was happy w/ my decision. I did not order room service, but grateful for the free Wifi.  I admit the walls were thin and did hear everyone that passed the hallway.  Especially bc our room was right in front of the elevator.  I did not hear any hotel construction noise as others have mentioned. WARNING...when stopping by the concierge, they may invite you to attend a Wyndham presentation in the hopes of selling you a Timeshare.  If you attend the 120 minute presentation, they offer a $100 American Express gift card & $100 Dining Dough credit.  If you are not interested in buying, I suggest you start practicing how to say "NO" bc they really will try to glamorize everything, "today is the day to buy." Overall, I was satisfied w/ my stay.  The noise level wasn't so bad bc we were hardly in the room except to shower & sleep. The hotel decor was updated and I didn't find any bed bugs. This is not a 5 start hotel but definitely not a motel either. For the rate of this room & prime location I have no complaints.  Also, the staff was very friendly.  Thanks Sara for letting us know when our friend dropped off our Cubs tickets while we were out!
