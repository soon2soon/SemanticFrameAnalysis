Just went on the Windy for the first time this past weekend. Captain Ralph and the rest of the crew were super friendly and engaging.  They let some kids help put up the sails and steer the ship.  The "pirate" giving the architectural talk was entertaining and you can't beat the view of the Chicago skyline.  Even though I live in Chicago and often try to avoid the tourists at Navy Pier, this was a really fun day for our family.   Thanks!
