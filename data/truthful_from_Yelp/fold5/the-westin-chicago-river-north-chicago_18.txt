Stayed here for a friends wedding and it's absolutely gorgeous!! It's in an amazing location, the staff was friendly and they even had free cider (which was reaaaaaally Â good). The room was really nice, although I wasn't a fan of the "heavenly" shower they had. I would definitely stay here again, it's a very impressive spot! Only downside is the Ember Grill inside- AVOID! There are better places to go just outside the door.
