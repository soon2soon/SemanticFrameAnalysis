My hubby spoiled me by taking me to Chicago to celebrate my bday and we decided to stay at the Talbott hotel thanks to the good reviews and they were right! What an exceptional hotel, all the staff greeted us with a nice smile and made us feel welcome. At the counter they informed us since it was our first time there that they had given us an upgrade for our room, niceeeeeee. Breakfast was also included from the restaurant attached to their hotel (the food was ok). We opened the door of our room and our jaws dropped, what a huge room! The bed was a king size with such soft and cozy sheets and comforter, the bathroom had both a shower and a bathtub, two separate vanities, I don't have to wait for my hubby to finish brushing his teeth??....THANK YOU. And I haven't finished yet, there was also a spacious living room with a big plasma TV, a mini bar fully stocked with beer, sodas, fancy peanuts, cashews, chocolates (of course they charge for those items) and even though I was not interested in buying any of them, it is nice that they offer those kind of options. The closet on the bedroom even had bathrobes and slippers! Wow, cool. The curtains were so dark we slept like babies all snugged in that wonderful bed, I had not felt that cozyness in a loong time.....wait a minute! I have never felt it before! So I loved every minute of it. They offer complimentary wi fi but my hubby and I had constantly problems in connecting to it, but oh well, it was only one night so it was not a big deal for us. If you really would like to spoil yourself for a night or a few days, sleep like a baby and be treated so well, this is your hotel! We will definitely come back.
