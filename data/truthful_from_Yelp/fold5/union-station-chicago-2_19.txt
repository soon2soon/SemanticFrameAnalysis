What a classic Chicago establishment.  I used to love going to Union Station. The Great Hall is wonderful.  So large, so vast, so peaceful. The food courts and shopping areas are nice too.  Sufficient ATM's, mail boxes and other convenient nooks are there.  Union Station houses Amtrak and Metra so, of course there is a lot of hustle and bussle.  But,  its a nice place to wait or to connect with friends.  Parking is great.  YES, you have to pay, BUT, the parking garage is connected to Union Station.
