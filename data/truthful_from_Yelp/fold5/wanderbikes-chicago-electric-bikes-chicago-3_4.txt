I had a great time!  My friend and I were visiting from out of town and stumbled upon this place.  Basically, we saw the bicycles and were intrigued.   We were greeted by Tyler who explained the electric bikes to us.  We were interested, but before we agreed; I needed a quick lesson.  :)  I had not been on a bicycle since I was in grade school.  So Brady (Tyler's associate) was kind enough to help me make sure that I knew what I was doing.  After making a complete a$$ of myself which my friend happened to catch on video; off we went.   We rode along the waterfront of Lake Michigan which has a nice bike trail to the Navy Pier.  It was a gorgeous day and we were able to ride the bikes for two hours.  These bikes came with a bag to hold your belongings and a lock.  The bike has the option of going from electric to the normal style.  I will definitely be back during my next visit.  The guys were great and we had so much fun!
