We stayed here for our 20th anniversary. Greeted by the friendliest staff. From front desk, to maids, to room service, to Enrique in the restaurant...everyone was friendly, kind and helpful. Our room was beautiful. The hotel is older and charming. Wish we could have used the fridge for our own items. And wish they had a microwave. Everything was clean and well appointed. In our room was a hallmark card signed by the staff wishing us a happy anniversary. Plus champagne and strawberries. Such a nice touch. Ate Breakfast in the restaurant every day. Wonderful hot breakfast. Delicious muffins and croissants. The manager was helpful and friendly. I would stay here every time I come to Chicago and I hope I can convince one of my children to have their wedding reception in the Tip Tap Top ballroom. Will definitely be back.
