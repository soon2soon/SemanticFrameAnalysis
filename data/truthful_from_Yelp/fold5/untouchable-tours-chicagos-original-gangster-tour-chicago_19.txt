Totally cheesy and at some times boring, but fun nonetheless.  We went on this tour while visiting family here and I really liked it. I liked their lame humor, bus swerving, tacky outfits, and bad accents.  Its meant to be kitchy.  I recommended it to my other out of town relatives too! Oh and I like the old bus too!
