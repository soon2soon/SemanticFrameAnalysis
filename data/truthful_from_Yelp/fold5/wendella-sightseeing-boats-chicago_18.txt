Everyone always talks about how awesome the architecture boat tours are and how we should go on one.  People have been telling me this for years and yet I've never gone on one... until now.  People were not wrong.  probably what made it even more awesome was we went on a clear 80 degree day.  so almost everyone sat on the top deck and listened to our very informative tour guide. on the lower decks, they have their gift shop and the bar.  it was pretty reasonably priced too, $5 for a 12oz 312, or $7 for a plastic pint glass that was refillable for $5.  they had speakers rigged up throughout the boat so I could hear the guide even when I had to break the seal. the entire crew was super friendly and very helpful as well.  we took along our 5 month old and they were cool with us stowing the stroller and the carrier, even though it took up soo much room.  the guide noticed we were trying to take a family picture on the boat selfie style, and she offered to take the picture for us. all in all, we had an amazing time, great views and great info.
