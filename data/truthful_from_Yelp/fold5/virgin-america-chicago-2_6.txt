How clean are those automated toilet seat covers? Anyway... I love this airline. This is always my first choice, even if I have to pay $100 more, it is worth it. Family Friendly! Â There is pre-boarding for groups with kids under 5. The bathrooms have changing tables. Games and TV to keep everyone entertained! Outlets and usb charging areas on the plane and by the gates.
