This was the absolute best bang for  the buck.  The ship is beautiful, the crew amazing from Brittany, who was wonderful. She took the time to explain what we should expect. Where we should sit. Which trip we should take. With a smile and the most amazingly positive attitude. Her energy is contagious.Red beard is hysterical,and brilliantly entertaining while keeping his audience focused as he weaves a seamless tale that travels through   Chicago's history The captain, Alan I believe was his name was lovely, charming and let me drive the ship. My friends and I had the best 75 minutes today. If you do nothing else this summer wether you are a local or a tourist do this.
