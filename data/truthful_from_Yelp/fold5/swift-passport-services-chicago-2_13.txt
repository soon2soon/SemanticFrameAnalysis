I called Swift Passport Services with the intention to apply for European visas. I spoke with a representative, Rob, and he quickly with tremendous expertise helped me dissect my situation and told me that I would not need to apply for visa at all. Even though I would not become his immediate customer, Rob is very professional and thorough in answering all of my questions and concerns. This left me great experience. I definitely plan to come back to Swift for my future visa needs based on their customer-oriented attitude and helpful advice.
