I had a great experience at this hostel! The front desk people were awesome and friendly. The bathrooms were private (only one person can use at a time) and gave off a homey vibe. The bedroom was nice and clean. However, the floor squeaks very loudly. I was on the top bed and had trouble falling asleep because whoever stayed above us were awake all night and the floor squeaked a lot as they moved around.
