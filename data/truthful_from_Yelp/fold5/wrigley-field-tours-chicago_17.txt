I don't even know how to describe the Wrigley Field Tour except for, it's absolutely phenomenal! Visiting from Los Angeles and being a die-hard Dodgers fan, I wasn't sure how receptive I'd be walking through and learning about the Chicago Cubs. Wow, I was blown away at all the things we got to explore and be a part of. Walking through the player locker rooms, sitting in the stands, and walking onto the field was an incredible feeling. Â We learned so much about the Cubs and Wrigley Field and the history that encompasses this great franchise. After spending nearly two hours at Wrigley Field, it's almost impossible not to root for the Cubs just a little bit. This was the highlight of our trip and I would recommend this tour to anyone (even those who aren't sports enthusiasts). The coolest part about it, the Dodgers were coming into town and they were setting up the stadium for their arrival. We got to stand on the Dodgers batting circle on Wrigley Field :)
