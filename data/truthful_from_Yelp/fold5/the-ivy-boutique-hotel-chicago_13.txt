I stayed at the king luxury studio suite for 3 nights and enjoyed every second. I love the modern design of this hotel: 1) LCD screen on the bathroom mirror 2) daily free dessert delivered by room service (the chocolate chip cookie was warm, so was the brownie) 3) friendly, helpful front desk and security 4) imperative key check in at the elevator, ensures no creeps have access to your floor/building. 5) One flatscreen TV by your bed, another one in the living room. 6) rainfall shower- superb design. 7) front desk delivers daily comforting, handwritten notes with temperature of the day and logistic suggestion, truly made me special. 8) Microwave at the lobby. You bring your leftover food to the front desk and they heat it up for you, bring it over to your room on a carefully assembled, room service plate. Awesome! Everything was modern, spot less, and just overall makes you feel like you are a king. I certainly will be back!
