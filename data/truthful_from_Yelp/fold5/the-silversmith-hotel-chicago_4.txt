I spent two nights here on 2/15 and 2/16 with my girlfriend and I can't say enough about how pleased we were with our visit to this upscale boutique hotel. We were only supposed to stay the night of the 16th, but had to make a last minute change to add another day and the hotel staff was more than happy to accommodate and even found me a cheaper rate.    When we arrived got to our room I immediately noticed how clean it was and how much space there was. We stayed in a deluxe king which had a nice living room which a large tv, an equally large tv in the bedroom and a sprawling clean and bright bathroom.    Other reviews mentioned the doors being poorly framed, which is certainly true. One of our bathroom doors and a closet door were barely able to close, however this did not effect outside noise so there was no issue.    The bed was very clean and comfortable and the curtains proved to be extra thick.  When I woke in the morning I thought for sure it was still 3am due to how dark it was which was nice.    Our first night we stopped by the bar off the lobby which had a nice vibe and modern décor, as well as plenty of seating. The bar tender was on his game and made and excellent drink and even had as sample different gins and vodka before making a choice which we did not even ask for.    Overall I've no real complaints. The free wifi was subpar, but for $5 a day you can upgrade. Nice, clean, and affordable. What more can you ask for? Will come again! (forgot to mentione, many of the pictures on here are outdated. The hotel has definitely had a total renovation since many of these were posted.)
